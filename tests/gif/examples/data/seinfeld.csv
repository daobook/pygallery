S01E01,JERRY,"Do you know what this is all about? Do you know, why were here? To be out, this is out...and out is one of the single most enjoyable experiences of life. People...did you ever hear people talking about We should go out? This is what theyre talking about...this whole thing, were all out now, no one is home. Not one person here is home, were all out! There are people tryin to find us, they dont know where we are. (on an imaginary phone) Did you ring?, I cant find him. Where did he go? He didnt tell me where he was going. He must have gone out. You wanna go out you get ready, you pick out the clothes, right? You take the shower, you get all ready, get the cash, get your friends, the car, the spot, the reservation...Then youre standing around, whatta you do? You go We gotta be getting back. Once youre out, you wanna get back! You wanna go to sleep, you wanna get up, you wanna go out again tomorrow, right? Where ever you are in life, its my feeling, youve gotta go."
S01E01,JERRY,"(pointing at Georges shirt) See, to me, that button is in the worst possible spot. The second button literally makes or breaks the shirt, look at it. Its too high! Its in no-mans-land. You look like you live with your mother."
S01E01,GEORGE,Are you through?
S01E01,JERRY,"You do of course try on, when you buy?"
S01E01,GEORGE,"Yes, it was purple, I liked it, I dont actually recall considering the buttons."
S01E01,JERRY,"Oh, you dont recall?"
S01E01,GEORGE,"(on an imaginary microphone) Uh, no, not at this time."
S01E01,JERRY,"Well, senator, Id just like to know, what you knew and when you knew it."
S01E01,CLAIRE,Mr. Seinfeld. Mr. Costanza.
S01E01,GEORGE,"Are, are you sure this is decaf? Wheres the orange indicator?"
S01E01,CLAIRE,"Its missing, I have to do it in my head decaf left, regular right, decaf left, regular right...its very challenging work."
S01E01,JERRY,"Can you relax, its a cup of coffee. Claire is a professional waitress."
S01E01,CLAIRE,Trust me George. No one has any interest in seeing you on caffeine.
S01E01,GEORGE,How come youre not doin the second show tomorrow?
S01E01,JERRY,"Well, theres this uh, woman might be comin in."
S01E01,GEORGE,"Wait a second, wait a second, what coming in, what woman is coming in?"
S01E01,JERRY,"I told you about Laura, the girl I met in Michigan?"
S01E01,GEORGE,"No, you didnt!"
S01E01,JERRY,"I thought I told you about it, yes, she teaches political science? I met her the night I did the show in Lansing..."
S01E01,GEORGE,Ha.
S01E01,JERRY,"(looks in the creamer) Theres no milk in here, what..."
S01E01,GEORGE,"Wait wait wait, what is she... (takes the milk can from Jerry and puts it on the table) What is she like?"
S01E01,JERRY,"Oh, shes really great. I mean, shes got like a real warmth about her and shes really bright and really pretty and uh... the conversation though, I mean, it was... talking with her is like talking with you, but, you know, obviously much better."
S01E01,GEORGE,"(smiling) So, you know, what, what happened?"
S01E01,JERRY,"Oh, nothing happened, you know, but is was great."
S01E01,GEORGE,"Oh, nothing happened, but it was..."
S01E01,JERRY,Yeah.
S01E01,GEORGE,This is great!
S01E01,JERRY,Yeah.
S01E01,GEORGE,"So, you know, she calls and says she wants to go out with you tomorrow night? God bless! Devil you!"
S01E01,JERRY,"Yeah, well...not exactly. I mean, she said, you know, she called this morning and said she had to come in for a seminar and maybe well get together."
S01E01,GEORGE,"(whistles disapprovingly) Ho ho ho, Had to? Had to come in?"
S01E01,JERRY,"Yeah, but..."
S01E01,GEORGE,Had to come in and maybe well get together? Had to and maybe?
S01E01,JERRY,Yeah!
S01E01,GEORGE,"No...no...no, I hate to tell you this. Youre not gonna see this woman."
S01E01,JERRY,"What, are you serious...why, why did she call?"
S01E01,GEORGE,"How do I know, maybe, you know, maybe she wanted to be polite."
S01E01,JERRY,To be polite? You are insane!
S01E01,GEORGE,"All right, all right, I didnt want to tell you this. You wanna know why she called you?"
S01E01,JERRY,Yes!
S01E01,GEORGE,"Youre a back-up, youre a second-line, a just-in-case, a B-plan, a contingency!"
S01E01,JERRY,"Oh, I get it, this is about the button."
S01E01,GEORGE,"Claire, Claire, youre a woman, right?"
S01E01,CLAIRE,"What gave it away, George?"
S01E01,GEORGE,"Uhm...Id like to ask you...ask you to analyze a hypothetical phone call, you know, from a female point of view."
S01E01,GEORGE,"(to Claire) Now, a woman calls me, all right?"
S01E01,CLAIE,Uh huh.
S01E01,GEORGE,She says she has to come to New York on business...
S01E01,JERRY,Oh you are beautiful!
S01E01,GEORGE,"...and, and maybe shell see me when she gets there, does this woman intend to spend time with me?"
S01E01,CLAIRE,"Id have to say, uuhh, no."
S01E01,(George shows his note-block to Jerry; it says very largely,NO.)
S01E01,CLAIRE,To be polite.
S01E01,GEORGE,To be polite. I rest my case.
S01E01,JERRY,"Good. Did you have fun? You have no idea, what youre talking about, now, come on, come with me. (stands up) I gotta go get my stuff out of the dryer anyway."
S01E01,GEORGE,Im not gonna watch you do laundry.
S01E01,JERRY,"Oh, come on, be a come-with guy."
S01E01,GEORGE,"Come on, Im tired."
S01E01,CLAIRE,"(to Jerry) Dont worry, I gave him a little caffeine. Hell perk up."
S01E01,GEORGE,"(panicking) Right, I knew I felt something!"
S01E01,GEORGE,Jerry? I have to tell you something. This is the dullest moment Ive ever experienced.
S01E01,JERRY,"Well, look at this guy. Look, hes got everything, hes got detergents, sprays, fabric softeners.  This is not his first load."
S01E01,GEORGE,"I need a break, Jerry, you know. I gotta get out of the city. I feel so cramped..."
S01E01,JERRY,And you didnt even hear how she sounded.
S01E01,GEORGE,What?!
S01E01,JERRY,Laura.
S01E01,GEORGE,I cant believe- (falls on his knees) WE ALREADY DISCUSSED THIS!
S01E01,JERRY,"Yeah, but how could you be so sure?"
S01E01,GEORGE,"Cause its signals, Jerry, its signals! (snapping his fingers) Dont you- all right. Did she even ask you, what you were doin tomorrow night, if you were busy?"
S01E01,JERRY,No.
S01E01,GEORGE,She calls you today and she doesnt make a plan for tomorrow? What is that? Its Saturday night!
S01E01,JERRY,Yeah.
S01E01,GEORGE,"What is that? Its ridiculous! You dont even know what hotel shes staying at, you cant call her. Thats a signal, Jerry, thats a signal! (snaps his fingers) Signal!"
S01E01,JERRY,Maybe youre right.
S01E01,GEORGE,Maybe Im right? Of course Im right.
S01E01,JERRY,"This is insane. You know, I dont even know where shes staying! She, shes not gonna call me, this is unbelievable."
S01E01,GEORGE,"I know, I know. Listen, your stuff has to be done by now, why dont you just see if its dry?"
S01E01,JERRY,"No no no, dont interrupt the cycle. The machine is working, it, it knows what its doing. Just let it finish."
S01E01,GEORGE,Youre gonna overdry it.
S01E01,JERRY,"You, you cant overdry."
S01E01,GEORGE,Why not?
S01E01,JERRY,"Same as you cant overwet. You see, once something is wet, its wet. Same thing with death. Like once you die youre dead, right? Lets say you drop dead and I shoot you. Youre not gonna die again, youre already dead. You cant overdie, you cant overdry."
S01E01,GEORGE,(to the other laundry patrons) Any questions?
S01E01,JERRY,How could she not tell me where she was staying?
S01E01,GEORGE,Look at that. Theyre done!
S01E01,JERRY,"Laundry day is the only exciting day in the life of clothes. It is...yknow, think about it. The washing machine is the nightclub of clothes. You know, its dark, theres bubbles happening, theyre all kinda dancing around in there- shirt grabs the underwear, Cmon babe, lets go. You come by, you open up the lid and theyll- (stiffens up, as the clothes) Socks are the most amazing article of clothing. They hate their lives, theyre in the shoes with stinky feet, the boring drawers. The dryer is their only chance to escape and they all know it. They knew a escape from the dryer. They plan it in the hamper the night before, Tomorrow, the dryer, Im goin. You wait here! The dryer door swings open and the sock is waiting up against the side wall. He hopes you dont see him and then he goes down the road. They get buttons sewn on their faces, join a puppet show. So theyre showing me on television the detergent for getting out bloodstains. Is this a violent image to anybody? Bloodstains? I mean, come on, you got a T-shirt with bloodstains all over it, maybe laundry isnt your biggest problem right now. You gotta get the harpoon out your chest first."
S01E01,JERRY,"(answering, quickly) If you know what happened in the Met game, dont say anything, I taped it, hello. Yeah, no, Im sorry, you have the wrong number. Yeah, no"
S01E01,JERRY,(to the door) Yeah?
S01E01,KESSLER,Are you up?
S01E01,JERRY,"(to Kessler) Yeah. (to the phone) Yeah, people do move. Have you ever seen the big trucks out on the street? Yeah, no problem."
S01E01,KESSLER,"Boy, the Mets blew it tonight, huh?"
S01E01,JERRY,"(upset) Ohhhh, what are you doing? Kessler, its a tape! I taped the game, its one oclock in the morning! I avoided human contact all night to watch this."
S01E01,KESSLER,"Hey, Im sorry, I- you know, I, I thought you knew. (takes two loaves of bread out of his pockets, and holds them out to Jerry.) You got any meat?"
S01E01,JERRY,"Meat? I dont, I dont know, go... hunt! (Kessler opens the refrigerator and sticks his head in.) Well what happened in the game anyway?"
S01E01,KESSLER,"(from the refrigerator) What happened? Well, they STUNK, thats what happened!"
S01E01,KESSLER,"You know, I almost wound up going to that game."
S01E01,JERRY,(cynical) Yeah you almost went to the game. You havent been out of the building in ten years!
S01E01,KESSLER,"Yeah. (Jerry sits down on the couch. Kessler walks over with his sandwich and looks at Jerry and uses expressions to ask Jerry to move the newspapers on the other side of the couch so he could site down. Kessler sits down next to him and starts turning over the pages of a magazine. Suddenly he spots an article he likes and tears it out. Jerry gives him a look as if to say, Do you mind?) Are you done with this?"
S01E01,JERRY,No.
S01E01,KESSLER,"When youre done, let me know."
S01E01,JERRY,"Yeah, yeah...you can have it tomorrow."
S01E01,KESSLER,I thought I wasnt allowed to be in here this weekend.
S01E01,JERRY,"No, its okay now, that, that girl is not comin. Uh, I misread the whole thing."
S01E01,KESSLER,You want me to talk to her?
S01E01,JERRY,I dont think so.
S01E01,KESSLER,"Oh, I can be very persuasive. Do you know that I was almost... a lawyer."
S01E01,JERRY,"That close, huh?"
S01E01,KESSLER,You better believe it.
S01E01,JERRY,"Hello...Oh, hi, Laura."
S01E01,KESSLER,"Oh, give me it...let me talk to her."
S01E01,JERRY,"(to the phone) No believe me, Im always up at this hour. How are you?... Great... Sure... What time does the plane get in?... I got my friend George to take me..."
S01E01,KESSLER,(to the TV) SLIDE! Wow!
S01E01,JERRY,"No, its, its just my neighbour... Um... Yeah, I got it. (Jerry takes a pencil and a cereal box to write on.) Ten-fifteen... No, dont be silly, go ahead and ask... Yeah, sure... Okay, great, no no, its no trouble at all... Ill see you tomorrow... Great, bye. (He hangs up the phone; to Kessler) I dont believe it. That was her. She wants to stay here!"
S01E01,JERRY,"If my father was moving this hed had to have a cigarette in his mouth the whole way. (as his father) 'Have you got your end?...Your ends got to come down first, easy now, drop it down...drop it down, your ends got to come down.'"
S01E01,GEORGE,"You know, I cant believe youre bringin in an extra bed for woman that wants to sleep with you. Why dont you bring in an extra guy too?"
S01E01,JERRY,"Look, its a very awkward situation. I dont wanna be presumptuous."
S01E01,GEORGE,"All right, all right, one more time, one more time! What was the exact phrasing of the request?"
S01E01,JERRY,"All right, she said she couldnt find a decent hotel room..."
S01E01,GEORGE,A decent hotel-room...
S01E01,JERRY,"Yeah, a decent hotel-room, would it be terribly inconvenient if she stayed at my place."
S01E01,GEORGE,"You cant be serious. This is New York city. There must be eleven million decent hotel rooms! Whatta you need? A flag? (waving his handkerchief) This is the signal, Jerry, this is the signal!"
S01E01,JERRY,"(cynical) This is the signal? Thank you, Mr. Signal. Where were you yesterday?"
S01E01,GEORGE,I think I was affected by the caffeine.
S01E01,GEORGE,"Ho, ho, ho, good dog, good dog..."
S01E01,KESSLER,"Hey, he really likes you, George."
S01E01,GEORGE,"Well, thats flattering."
S01E01,KESSLER,"Oh, hes gettin a drink of water. (pointing to the mattress) Is this for that girl?"
S01E01,JERRY,Yeah.
S01E01,KESSLER,Why even give her an option?
S01E01,JERRY,"This is a person I like, its not How to score on spring break."
S01E01,GEORGE,"Right, can we go? Cause Im double-parked, Im gonna get a ticket."
S01E01,JERRY,"Yeah, okay. Oh, wait a second. Oh, I forgot to clean the bathroom."
S01E01,GEORGE,So what? Thats good.
S01E01,JERRY,"Now, how could that be good?"
S01E01,GEORGE,"Because filth is good. Whaddaya think, rock stars have sponges and ammonia lyin around the bathroom? They, have a woman comin over, Ive gotta tidy up? Yeah right, in these matters you never do what your instincts tell you. Always, ALWAYS do the opposite."
S01E01,JERRY,This is how you operate?
S01E01,GEORGE,"Yeah, I wish."
S01E01,JERRY,Let me just wipe the sink.
S01E01,KESSLER,Why even give her an option for?
S01E01,KESSLER,"(to George, pointing at the mattress) Its unbelievable."
S01E01,GEORGE,Yeah.
S01E01,KESSLER,Hows the real estate-business?
S01E01,GEORGE,"(feeling awkward) Its uh, not bad, its comin along. Why? Did you need something."
S01E01,KRAMER,Do you handle any of that commercial...real estate?
S01E01,GEORGE,"Well, I might be getting into that."
S01E01,KESSLER,(slaps George on the arm) You keep me posted!
S01E01,GEORGE,"Im aware of you. (to Jerry) All right, lets go (opens the bathroom door) Lets go!"
S01E01,JERRY,"The dating world is not a fun world...its a pressure world, its a world of tension, its a world of pain...and you know, if a woman comes over to my house, I gotta get that bathroom ready, cause she needs things. Women need equipment. I dont know what they need. I know I dont have it, I know that- You know what they need, women seem to need a lot of cotton-balls. This is the one Im- always has been one of the amazing things to me...I have no cotton-balls, were all human beings, what is the story? Ive never had one...I never bought one, I never needed one, Ive never been in a situation, when I thought to myself I could use a cotton-ball right now. I can certainly get out of this mess. Women need them and they dont need one or two, they need thousands of them, they need bags, theyre like peat moss bags, have you ever seen these giant bags? Theyre huge and two days later, theyre out, theyre gone, the, the bag is empty, where are the cotton-balls, ladies? What are you doin with them? The only time I ever see em is in the bottom of your little waste basket, theres two or three, that look like theyve been through some horrible experience... tortured, interrogated, I dont know what happened to them. I once went out with a girl whos left a little zip-lock-baggy of cotton-balls over at my house. I dont know what to do with them, I took them out, I put them on my kitchen floor like little tumbleweeds. I thought maybe the cockroaches would see it, figure this is a dead town. Lets move on. The dating world is a world of pressure. Lets face it a date is a job interview that lasts all night. The only difference between a date and a job interview is not many job interviews is there a chance youll end up naked at the end of it. You know? Well, Bill, the boss thinks youre the man for the position, why dont you strip down and meet some of the people youll be workin with?"
S01E01,JERRY,Wouldnt it be great if you could ask a woman what shes thinking?
S01E01,GEORGE,"What a world that would be, if you just could ask a woman what shes thinkin."
S01E01,JERRY,"You know, instead, Im like a detective. I gotta pick up clues, the whole thing is a murder investigation."
S01E01,GEORGE,"Listen, listen, dont get worked up, cause youre gonna know the whole story the minute she steps off the plane."
S01E01,JERRY,Really? How?
S01E01,GEORGE,Cause its all in the greeting.
S01E01,JERRY,Uh-huh.
S01E01,GEORGE,"All right, if she puts the bags down before she greets you, thats a good sign."
S01E01,JERRY,Right.
S01E01,GEORGE,"You know, anything in the, in the lip area is good."
S01E01,JERRY,Lip area.
S01E01,GEORGE,You know a hug definitely good.
S01E01,JERRY,Hug is definitely good.
S01E01,GEORGE,Sure.
S01E01,JERRY,"Although what if its one of those hugs where the shoulders are touching, the hips are eight feet apart?"
S01E01,GEORGE,"Thats so brutal, I hate that."
S01E01,JERRY,You know how they do that?
S01E01,GEORGE,"Thats why, you know, a shake is bad."
S01E01,JERRY,"Shake is bad, but what if its the two-hander? The hand on the bottom, the hand on the top, the warm look in the eyes?"
S01E01,GEORGE,Hand sandwich.
S01E01,JERRY,Right.
S01E01,GEORGE,"I see, well, thats open to interpretation. Because so much depends on the layering and the quality of the wetness in the eyes."
S01E01,LAURA,Guess who?
S01E01,JERRY,"Hey, hey."
S01E01,LAURA & JERRY,Heeeey!
S01E01,JERRY,Its good to see you.
S01E01,LAURA,Hi.
S01E01,JERRY,This is my friend George.
S01E01,LAURA,"Hi, how nice to meet you."
S01E01,GEORGE,"Hi, how are you?"
S01E01,JERRY,This is Laura.
S01E01,GEORGE,"Laura, sure."
S01E01,JERRY,(to Laura) I cant believe youre here.
S01E01,GEORGE & JERRY,"Ooh yeah, the bags, sure."
S01E01,LAURA,"Oh, thank you."
S01E01,JERRY,"(aside, to George) Now that was an interesting greeting, did you notice that, George?"
S01E01,GEORGE,"Yes, the surprise blindfold greeting. That wasnt in the manual, I dont know."
S01E01,JERRY,"So uh, what do you think?"
S01E01,LAURA,"Ooohhh, wow! This place isnt so bad."
S01E01,JERRY,"Yeah, it kind a motivates me to work on the road. So uh, make yourself at home. (Laura sits down on the couch, takes off her shoes and opens some buttons of her shirt.) So uh, can I get you anything? Uuhhh, bread, water...salad-dressing?"
S01E01,LAURA,"(laughs) Actually, um, do you have any wine?"
S01E01,JERRY,"Uh, yeah, I think I do."
S01E01,LAURA,"(referring to a lamp) Oh, do you mind if I turn this down?"
S01E01,JERRY,"Uh, no, yeah, go right ahead."
S01E01,LAURA,"Uh, Jerry, uh, I was wandering, would it be possible  and if its not, fine  for me to stay here tomorrow night too?"
S01E01,JERRY,"Uh, yeah, yeah, sure, why dont you stay? Yeah, uhm...What is your, what is your schedule for tomorrow? Are you, are you doin anything?"
S01E01,LAURA,"No, Id love to do something. Uh, I have my seminar in the morning, then after that Im right open."
S01E01,JERRY,Really? What would you like to do?
S01E01,LAURA,"Well... now I know this sounds touristy, but Id just love to go on one of those five-hour boat rides around Manhattan."
S01E01,JERRY,"(unenthusiastic) Yeah, we could do that...why not, why not. (pouring the wine) Im just, Im really glad youre here."
S01E01,JERRY,"(answering) Yeah, hello...yes...yes, she is, hold on. (to Laura) Um, its for you."
S01E01,LAURA,"(to the phone) Hello?... Hi!... No no it was great, right on time... No, I, Im gonna stay here tomorrow...yes, yes its fine... No, were goin on a boat ride... Dont be silly... Im not gonna have this conversation... Look, Ill call you tomorrow... Okay, bye. (She hangs up the phone.) Never get engaged."
S01E01,JERRY,(not excited) Youre engaged?
S01E01,LAURA,"You, you really have no idea what its like until you actually do it. And Im on this emotional roller coaster."
S01E01,JERRY,Youre engaged?
S01E01,LAURA,"You know, I cant believe it myself sometimes. You have to start thinking in terms of we. Ugh, its a very stressful situation."
S01E01,JERRY,(matter-of-factly) Youre engaged.
S01E01,LAURA,"Yeah, yeah, hes a great guy..."
S01E01,JERRY,Yeah.
S01E01,LAURA,"Youd really like him, you know, I cant wait to get on that boat."
S01E01,JERRY,Me too!
S01E01,JERRY,"I swear, I have absolutely no idea what women are thinking. I dont get it, okay? I, I, I admit, I, Im not getting the signals. I am not getting it! Women, theyre so subtle, their little...everything they do is subtle. Men are not subtle, we are obvious. Women know what men want, men know what men want, what do we want? We want women, thats it! Its the only thing we know for sure, it really is. We want women. How do we get them? Oh, we dont know bout that, we dont know. The next step after that we have no idea. This is why you see men honking car-horns, yelling from construction sites. These are the best ideas weve had so far. The car-horn honk, is that a beauty? Have you seen men doing this? What is this? The man is in the car, the woman walks by the front of the car, he honks. E-eeehh, eehhh, eehhh! This man is out of ideas. How does it...? E-e-e-eeeehhhh! I dont think she likes me. The amazing thing is, that we still get women, dont we? Men, I mean, men are with women. You see men with women. How are men getting women, many people wonder. Let me tell you a little bit about our organization. Wherever women are, we have a man working on the situation right now. Now, he may not be our best man, okay, we have a lot of areas to cover, but someone from our staff is on the scene. Thats why, I think, men get frustrated, when we see women reading articles, like Where to meet men? Were here, we are everywhere. Were honking our horns to serve you better."
S01E01,JERRY,"So, Im on line at the supermarket. Two women in front of me. One of them, her total was eight dollars, the other three dollars. They both of course choose to pay by the use of the..."
S01E01,AUDIENCE,Cheque.
S01E01,JERRY,"Cheque. Now, the fact is, if its a woman in front of you thats writing the cheque, you will not be waiting long. I have noticed that women are very fast with cheques, yknow, cause they write out so many cheques. The keys, they can never find in their purse, they dont know where that is, but the cheque book they got that. They never fumble for the cheque book. The cheque book comes out of a holster (Jerry draws imaginary book from a holster.) Who do I make it out to? Theres my ID. Theres something about a cheque that, to a man, is not masculine. I dont know exactly what it is. I think to a man, a cheque is like a note from your mother that says, I dont have any money, but if youll contact these people, Im sure theyll stick up for me... If you just trust me this one time- I dont have any money but I have these. I wrote on these. Is this of any value at all?"
S01E01,JERRY,Whats that one?
S01E01,ELAINE,Coccoon II The Return. I guess they didnt like it up there.
S01E01,JERRY,"Maybe they came back for Chinese food. Yknow Maureen Stapleton, if she gets a craving, shes probably screamin at those aliens, I gotta have a lo mein!"
S01E01,ELAINE,"Okay, whatre we doing here? I have seen everything."
S01E01,JERRY,Oh yeah? I dont believe youve seen... this.
S01E01,ELAINE,"Oh, lovely."
S01E01,JERRY,Yeah.
S01E01,ELAINE,What do you think their parents think?
S01E01,JERRY,"So, uh, whats your son doing now, Dr. Stevens? Oh, hes a public fornicator. Yes, hes a fine boy..."
S01E01,ELAINE,Yknow what? This would be a really funny gift for Pamelas birthday.
S01E01,JERRY,Pamela? Do I know her?
S01E01,ELAINE,"Yeah, you met her when we were going out."
S01E01,JERRY,"Oh yeah, right..."
S01E01,ELAINE,"You have no idea who Im talking about, do you?"
S01E01,JERRY,(quickly) No.
S01E01,ELAINE,"Blonde hair, remember? Glasses? (pause) Have you totally blocked out the entire time we were a couple?"
S01E01,JERRY,(a lightbulb goes on in his head) Riverside Drive.
S01E01,ELAINE,"Right! In fact... No, never mind..."
S01E01,JERRY,"Well, what is it?"
S01E01,ELAINE,"Well, a bunch of people are getting together tomorrow night at some bar for her birthday, but... (Jerry turns in disgust) you dont want to go to... that... no."
S01E01,JERRY,"Wait a second, wait a second. We could work out a little deal here."
S01E01,ELAINE,What little deal?
S01E01,JERRY,"I will go to that, if you go with me to a little family wedding I have on Saturday."
S01E01,ELAINE,"A wedding? Have you lost it, man?"
S01E01,JERRY,"Yknow, my parents are coming in for this..."
S01E01,ELAINE,Theyre coming in?
S01E01,JERRY,"Yeah, tomorrow."
S01E01,ELAINE,"Hey, did your father ever get that hair weave?"
S01E01,JERRY,"No, no. Still doin the big sweep across."
S01E01,ELAINE,Why does he do that?
S01E01,JERRY,"Doesnt think anyone can tell. So cmon, do we have a deal?"
S01E01,ELAINE,A wedding?
S01E01,JERRY,Theres a lot of people to mock...
S01E01,ELAINE,"All right, what the hell."
S01E01,JERRY,Great!
S01E01,WOMAN,"When youre dead, youre dead. Thats it. Youre not goin anywhere..."
S01E01,ELAINE,Cmon lets go...
S01E01,JERRY,Was I supposed to bring something?
S01E01,ELAINE,You could have.
S01E01,JERRY,I met her one time...
S01E01,ELAINE,It is not necessary.
S01E01,JERRY,What did you say then?
S01E01,ELAINE,Sssshhhhhh!!!
S01E01,PAMELA,Hi
S01E01,ELAINE,"Hi, Pamela, you remember Jerry."
S01E01,PAMELA,"(shakes Jerry's hand) Yes, we met."
S01E01,JERRY,"Hi, happy birthday."
S01E01,PAMELA,"Thanks, ah, everybody, this is Elaine and Jerry."
S01E01,"GUESTS, JERRY & ELAINE",Hi
S01E01,JERRY,I didnt bring anything.
S01E01,PAMELA,"Uh, I put you two right here."
S01E01,JERRY,"Oh, Okay (turns to rest of table) Im sorry, I didnt know what to bring, nobody told me."
S01E01,VANESSA,How big a tip do you think itd take to get him to stop?
S01E01,JERRY,Im in for five...
S01E01,VANESSA,Ill supply the hat.
S01E01,JERRY,(thinking) Uh-oh... What do we have here?
S01E01,VANESSA,Why dont you relax and take your jacket off?
S01E01,JERRY,"Oh, I cant. Uh, I have a tendency to get chilly."
S01E01,VANESSA,How masculine.
S01E01,JERRY,"Plus Im wearing short sleeves, I dont want to expose my tattoos. (Vanessa smiles; thinking) Shes unbelievable!"
S01E01,ROGER,"(to Vanessa) Hey, this guy says he knows Bricker."
S01E01,VANESSA,"Oh, you know Bricker! From where?"
S01E01,JERRY,"(thinking) Whats going on here? Gotta be her boyfriend, shes too good to be alone. Whats the difference, I cant maneouver anyway with Elaine next to me."
S01E01,VANESSA,(to Jerry) How do you know Pamela?
S01E01,JERRY,"Uh, friend of a friend. And you?"
S01E01,VANESSA,We went to law school together.
S01E01,ELAINE,"(interrupting Jerry's conversation) Oh, Jerry!"
S01E01,JERRY,"(turning to Elaine; thinking) Oh no, not now."
S01E01,ELAINE,I had this dream last night and you were in it.
S01E01,JERRY,"Oh really? (tries turning away in the hopes Elaine gets the hint; thinking) Oh God, I gotta get out of this."
S01E01,ELAINE,"You were you, but, you werent you..."
S01E01,JERRY,"No kidding. (thinking) Why is this happening? Please, make her stop!"
S01E01,ELAINE,"I think, I think we were in my house where I grew up, and you were standing there, you were looking out the window..."
S01E01,JERRY,(thinking) This is brutal.
S01E01,ELAINE,You turned around and you had these wooden teeth.
S01E01,JERRY,"How do you like that? (tries to turn away again; thinking)Can I turn now? Is this over? No, I cant, I cant. Im stuck."
S01E01,ELAINE,(noticing Jerry not wanting to listen; annoyed) Jerry? Are you listening to me?
S01E01,JERRY,"Yes, I heard you."
S01E01,PAMELA,"Elaine, whats the name of that jewelry store you took me to that time?"
S01E01,JERRY,"(thinking) Thank you, Pamela! (turns to talk to Vanessa; to Vanessa) So, youre a lawyer..."
S01E01,VANESSA,"Sagman, Bennet, Robbins, Oppenheim and Taft."
S01E01,JERRY,"(thinking) Sagman, Bennet, Robbins, Oppenheim and Taft. Sagman, Bennet, Robbins, Oppenheim and Taft... (to Vanessa) Of course, they handled my tattoo removal lawsuit."
S01E01,VANESSA,"Oh, that was you?"
S01E01,JERRY,"Imagine, spelling Mom with two Os."
S01E01,VANESSA,Very funny! What do you do?
S01E01,JERRY,Comedian.
S01E01,VANESSA,Really? That explains it.
S01E01,JERRY,"(thinking; quickly) Sagman, Bennet, Robbins, Oppenheim and Taft. Sagman, Bennet, Robbins, Oppenheim and Taft."
S01E01,ROGER,Are you ready?
S01E01,VANESSA,We gotta run. Happy birthday!
S01E01,JERRY,"(thinking) I cant believe it. I got nothing! I dont even know her name! Sagman, Bennet, Robbins, Oppenheim and Taft. Sagman, Bennet, Robbins, Oppen... Sagman... Sag..."
S01E01,JERRY,"That wasnt so bad, really."
S01E01,ELAINE,"Yknow, um, you could use a little work on your manners."
S01E01,JERRY,Why? What did I do?
S01E01,ELAINE,"Wel-Well, I just dont appreciate these little courtesy responses, like Im selling you aluminum siding."
S01E01,JERRY,I was listening!
S01E01,ELAINE,No! You couldnt wait to get back to your little... conversation.
S01E01,JERRY,"No, you were talking about the, the um, the dream you had."
S01E01,ELAINE,Uh-huh...
S01E01,JERRY,"Where you had, uh, wooden teeth."
S01E01,ELAINE,"No! No! You had wooden teeth! You had wooden teeth! I didnt have wooden teeth, you did!"
S01E01,JERRY,"All right, so I had wooden teeth, so what?"
S01E01,ELAINE,So nothing! Nothing. (annoyed sigh)
S01E01,JERRY,"Apparently Plato, who came up with the concept of the platonic relationship, was pretty excited about it. He named it after himself. He said, Yeah, I got this new thing Platonic. My idea, my name, callin it after myself. What I do is, I go out with the girls, I talk with them- dont do anything, and go right home. Whatd you think? I think its going to be big! I bet you there were other guys in history that tried to get relationships named after them, but it didnt work. Yknow, I bet you there were guys who tried to do it, just went, Uh, Hi, uh my names Rico. Would you like to go to bed immediately? Hey, its a Riconic relationship."
S01E01,JERRY,Hey!
S01E01,MORTY,"Ah, there he is!"
S01E01,JERRY,"This is what I like, see? You come home and your parents are in your bed!"
S01E01,HELEN,"Yknow, Jerry, we dont have to do this."
S01E01,JERRY,"What are you talkin about? Its fine, I love having you here."
S01E01,HELEN,Tomorrow well go to a hotel.
S01E01,JERRY,"Ma, will you stop?"
S01E01,HELEN,"No, why should we take over your apartment?"
S01E01,JERRY,I dont care. Im sleeping next door.
S01E01,HELEN,Your friend Kramer doesnt mind?
S01E01,JERRY,"No, hes making a bouillabaisse."
S01E01,JERRY,"So, dad, lemme ask you a question. How many people work at these big law offices?"
S01E01,MORTY,Depends on the firm.
S01E01,JERRY,"Yeah, but if you called up and described someone, do you think they would know who it was?"
S01E01,MORTY,Whats the matter? You need a lawyer?
S01E01,JERRY,"No, I met someone at this party, and I know where she works, but I dont know her name."
S01E01,MORTY,So why dont you ask someone who was at the party?
S01E01,JERRY,"Nah, the only one I could ask is Elaine, and I cant ask her."
S01E01,HELEN,Why not?
S01E01,JERRY,Because its complicated. Theres some tension there.
S01E01,HELEN,He used to go with her.
S01E01,HELEN,Which one is she?
S01E01,MORTY,From Maryland. The one who brought you the chocolate covered cherries you didnt like.
S01E01,HELEN,"Oh yeah, very alert. Warm person."
S01E01,JERRY,"Oh yeah, shes great."
S01E01,HELEN,"So, how come nothing materialized there?"
S01E01,JERRY,"Well, its a tough thing to talk about uh. I dunno..."
S01E01,HELEN,I know what it was.
S01E01,JERRY,You dont know what it was.
S01E01,HELEN,"So, what was it?"
S01E01,JERRY,"Well, we fight a lot for some reason."
S01E01,HELEN & MORTY,"Oh, well..."
S01E01,JERRY,And there was a little problem with the physical chemistry.
S01E01,HELEN,"Well, I think shes a very attractive girl."
S01E01,JERRY,"Oh, she is, she absolutely is."
S01E01,HELEN,I can see if there was a weight problem...
S01E01,JERRY,"No, its not that. It wasnt all one-sided."
S01E01,HELEN,"You know, you cant be so particular. Nobodys perfect."
S01E01,JERRY,"I know, I know..."
S01E01,MORTY,"Yknow Jerry, its a good thing I wasnt so particular."
S01E01,HELEN,"(hits Morty) Idiot. (to Jerry) So whore you looking for, Sophia Loren?"
S01E01,JERRY,Thats got nothin to do with it.
S01E01,MORTY,How about Loni Anderson?
S01E01,HELEN,Where do you get Loni Anderson?
S01E01,MORTY,"Why, whats wrong with Loni Anderson?"
S01E01,HELEN,I like Elaine more than Loni Anderson.
S01E01,JERRY,"What are you two talking about? Look, Elaine just wasnt the one."
S01E01,HELEN,And this other ones the one?
S01E01,JERRY,"I dunno, maybe..."
S01E01,MORTY,So ask Elaine there for her number.
S01E01,JERRY,"I cant. Shell get upset. I never talk about other women with her, especially this one tonight."
S01E01,HELEN,How could you still see her if your not interested?
S01E01,JERRY,Were friends.
S01E01,MORTY,Doesnt sound like youre friends to me. If you were friends you'd-youd ask her for the number. Do you know where this other one works?
S01E01,JERRY,Oh yeah.
S01E01,MORTY,"Well, go up to the office."
S01E01,HELEN,Up to her office?
S01E01,MORTY,"Go to the building. She goes out to lunch, doesnt she?"
S01E01,JERRY,I guess.
S01E01,MORTY,"So, you stand in the lobby, by the elevator, and wait for her to come down for lunch."
S01E01,JERRY,You mean stakeout the lobby?
S01E01,HELEN,"Morty, thats ridiculous. Just ask Elaine for the number!"
S01E01,MORTY,He doesnt want to ask Elaine for the number.
S01E01,HELEN,So youve got him standing by the elevator like a dope! What happens when he sees her?
S01E01,MORTY,He pretends he bumped into her!
S01E01,JERRY,Yknow what? This is not that bad an idea.
S01E01,GEORGE,What does she look like?
S01E01,JERRY,I dunno. Hard to say.
S01E01,GEORGE,What actress does she remind you of?
S01E01,JERRY,Loni Anderson.
S01E01,GEORGE,Loni Anderson?!
S01E01,JERRY,"What, theres something wrong with Loni Anderson? (pause) Hey listen, thanks again for running over here. I appreciate it."
S01E01,GEORGE,"Yeah, sure. I was showing a condo on 48th street. Besides, you think I wanna miss this? (chuckles)"
S01E01,JERRY,Im a little nervous.
S01E01,GEORGE,"Yeah, me too..."
S01E01,JERRY,"If I see her, what do I say that Im doing here in the building?"
S01E01,GEORGE,You came to see me. I work in the building.
S01E01,JERRY,What do you do?
S01E01,GEORGE,Im an architect.
S01E01,JERRY,Youre an architect?
S01E01,GEORGE,Im not?
S01E01,JERRY,I dont see architecture comin from you.
S01E01,GEORGE,(somewhat annoyed) I suppose you could be an architect.
S01E01,JERRY,I never said that I was the architect. Just somethin else.
S01E01,GEORGE,"All right, shes not even gonna ask, if we see her, which is remote."
S01E01,JERRY,"Well whaddaya want me to say, that I just wandered in here?"
S01E01,GEORGE,Were having lunch with a friend. He works in the building.
S01E01,JERRY,What is his name?
S01E01,GEORGE,Bert... Har... bin... son. Bert Har-bin-son.
S01E01,JERRY,Bert Harbinson? It sounds made up.
S01E01,GEORGE,"No good? All right, uh how about Art... Cor....."
S01E01,JERRY,Art Cor...
S01E01,GEORGE,...velay.
S01E01,JERRY,Corvelay?
S01E01,GEORGE,"Yeah, right."
S01E01,JERRY,"Well, what does he do?"
S01E01,GEORGE,Hes an importer.
S01E01,JERRY,"Just imports, no exports?"
S01E01,GEORGE,"(annoyed) Hes an importer/exporter, okay? (beat) Elaine ever call you back?"
S01E01,JERRY,"No, I guess shes still mad."
S01E01,GEORGE,"I dont understand, you never talk to her about other women?"
S01E01,JERRY,Never. (The elevator door opens.) Wait a second. Thats her. On the right.
S01E01,GEORGE,(anxious) I forgot who I am! Who am I?!
S01E01,JERRY,Youre you. Were having lunch with Art Corvelay.
S01E01,GEORGE,Vandelay!
S01E01,JERRY,Corvelay!
S01E01,GEORGE,Let me be the architect! I can do it!
S01E01,JERRY,"Hey, hey. uh Pamelas birthday party, didnt I see you there? Jerry."
S01E01,VANESSA,Sure! Hi!
S01E01,JERRY,"Uh, this is George. (reaches for her name) Im sorry..."
S01E01,VANESSA,Vanessa.
S01E01,GEORGE,Nice to meet you.
S01E01,JERRY,"Ah, Sagman, Bennet, Robbins, Oppenheim and Taft."
S01E01,VANESSA,"Thats right! Yea, whatre you doing here?"
S01E01,JERRY,"Oh, were meeting a friend of ours for lunch. He works here in the building."
S01E01,GEORGE,"Yeah, Art Vandelay."
S01E01,VANESSA,Really? Which company?
S01E01,JERRY & George,(turning to each other) I dont know. Hes an importer.
S01E01,VANESSA,Importer?
S01E01,GEORGE,...And exporter.
S01E01,JERRY,Hes an importer/exporter.
S01E01,GEORGE,"(clears his throat) Im, uh, Im an architect."
S01E01,VANESSA,Really. What do you design?
S01E01,GEORGE,"Uh, railroads, uh..."
S01E01,VANESSA,I thought engineers do that.
S01E01,GEORGE,They can...
S01E01,JERRY,Yknow Im sorry you had to leave so early the other night.
S01E01,VANESSA,"Oh, me too. My cousin had to go back to Boston."
S01E01,JERRY,"Oh, that guy was your cousin! (walking in front of George so he gets the picture to leave)"
S01E01,VANESSA,"Yeah, and that woman was your..."
S01E01,JERRY,Friend!
S01E01,GEORGE,"Ill just, uh, get a paper..."
S01E01,JERRY,"So, um, do you date uh immature men?"
S01E01,VANESSA,Almost exclusively...
S01E01,HELEN,Bum bum bum bum... I have no letters... Bum bum bum bum...
S01E01,JERRY,"(annoyed) Ma, will you go already?"
S01E01,HELEN,Bum bum bum bum...
S01E01,JERRY,What are you doing?!
S01E01,HELEN,"Wait, I just want to see something."
S01E01,JERRY,"You cant look in there, were playing!"
S01E01,KRAMER,Hi.
S01E01,JERRY,Hi.
S01E01,MORTY,"(cleaning his shoes) Good evening, Mr. Kramer!"
S01E01,KRAMER,Hey Morty! (to Jerry) Salad dressing?
S01E01,JERRY,Look.
S01E01,HELEN,Quo. Is that a word?
S01E01,JERRY,Maybe!
S01E01,HELEN,Will you challenge it?
S01E01,JERRY,"Ma, you cant look up words in the dictionary! (to Morty) Dad, shes cheating!"
S01E01,KRAMER,Quo? Thats not a word.
S01E01,HELEN,(to Jerry) Youre such a stickler...
S01E01,JERRY,"Well put something down, youre taking twenty minutes on this. So is Uncle Mac and Artie, theyre all coming over here before the wedding?"
S01E01,HELEN,"Theyll be here at two oclock. Oh, Elaine called. She said shed be here at two-thirty. And she says Hope your meeting went well with Art Vandelay?"
S01E01,JERRY,She said what?
S01E01,HELEN,"Just what I said, here."
S01E01,JERRY,"She knows! Oh, I am such a jackass."
S01E01,HELEN,She knows what?
S01E01,JERRY,She knows the whole stupid thing. Vanessa and the elevator...
S01E01,HELEN,"No, no, no, that wont do. He may have a Z."
S01E01,MORTY,"So, how did she find out?"
S01E01,JERRY,"Because, Vanessa probably told Pamela, and Pamela probably told Elaine."
S01E01,MORTY,"So, what are you? Afraid of her?"
S01E01,JERRY,Yes. Yes I am! (to Helen) What else did she say on the phone?
S01E01,HELEN,Whatever I wrote down.
S01E01,JERRY,"Yeah, but what was the tone in her voice? How did she sound?"
S01E01,HELEN,"Who am I, Rich Little?"
S01E01,MORTY,"Well, she cant be too mad. Shes still coming to the wedding."
S01E01,JERRY,"Yeah, but now Im nervous."
S01E01,HELEN,"Oh, stop it."
S01E01,JERRY,Quone?
S01E01,HELEN,...30...31...
S01E01,JERRY,"Quone? No, Im afraid that Im going to have to challenge that."
S01E01,HELEN,...32...
S01E01,KRAMER,"No, you dont have to challenge that. Thats a word. Thats a definite word."
S01E01,JERRY,I am challenging.
S01E01,KRAMER,Quone. To quone something.
S01E01,JERRY,Uh-huh.
S01E01,HELEN,Im not playing with you anymore.
S01E01,MORTY,Quones not a word.
S01E01,JERRY,No good. Sorry. There it is. Get it off.
S01E01,HELEN,(to Kramer) Why did you make me put that down?
S01E01,KRAMER,"Nah, we need a medical dictionary! If a patient gets difficult, you quone him."
S01E01,CAROL,"You want some funny material, you oughta come down to where I work, now thats a sitcom!"
S01E01,JERRY,You must have quite a time down there.
S01E01,CAROL,We got plenty of time.
S01E01,JERRY,"Oh, Im sorry. Im just waiting for someone."
S01E01,UNCLE MAC,Watch what you say to this guy. Hell put it in his next act!
S01E01,JERRY,"Yeah, yeah..."
S01E01,UNCLE MAC,"Jerry, did I tell you that Im writing a book? An autobiography."
S01E01,JERRY,"Yeah, Uncle Mac, you mentioned it."
S01E01,UNCLE MAC,Its based on all my experiences!
S01E01,JERRY,Thats perfect.
S01E01,JERRY,Could you excuse me one second? Im sorry.
S01E01,JERRY,"How do you do? (introducing himself) Uh, Jerry Seinfeld."
S01E01,ELAINE,"Oh, how do you do? Elaine Benes."
S01E01,JERRY,"Um, do you want to do this now, or do you want to wait until we get in the car?"
S01E01,ELAINE,"Oh no, lets do it now."
S01E01,JERRY,"All right, the whole elevator business, let me just explain-"
S01E01,ELAINE,Okay.
S01E01,ARTIE,"Jerry, were you goin with us?"
S01E01,JERRY,"No, Im gonna take my car."
S01E01,ARTIE,Thats why I brought the wagon. Why the hell did I bring the wagon?
S01E01,JERRY,"Anyway, you know why I didnt ask you, I mean I felt so uncomfortable, and you were so annoyed in the cab."
S01E01,ELAINE,"Well, Jerry, I never saw you flirt with anyone before. It was quite the spectacle."
S01E01,CAROL,"Jerry, well see you there. Bye, Elaine."
S01E01,ELAINE,"Oh, bye. Good to see you."
S01E01,ARTIE,"Oh, we didnt meet."
S01E01,JERRY,"Oh, Im sorry. Elaine, this is my cousin, Artie Levine."
S01E01,ARTIE,(correcting Jerry) Levine.
S01E01,JERRY,"(sarcastically) Yeah, Levine. And Im Jerry Cougar Mellencamp. Anyway, I admit it was a fairly ridiculous thing to do, but I mean, I mean, obviously we have a little problem here."
S01E01,ELAINE,"Yeah, obviously."
S01E01,JERRY,"I mean, if were gonna be friends, we gotta be able to talk about other people."
S01E01,ELAINE,Couldnt agree more.
S01E01,JERRY,Good.
S01E01,ELAINE,Good.
S01E01,JERRY,Good.
S01E01,ELAINE,Great!
S01E01,JERRY,Great? Where do you get great?
S01E01,ELAINE,Its great to... talk about... other people...
S01E01,JERRY,...Guys?
S01E01,ELAINE,Yeah.
S01E01,JERRY,"Uh-huh. Yeah. So, anybody specific?"
S01E01,ELAINE,No. A general guy.
S01E01,JERRY,Oh really? Elaine Marie Benes...
S01E01,ELAINE,"What? No, its not a big deal."
S01E01,JERRY,"No, thats great! Thats terrific!"
S01E01,ELAINE,"No, we just met..."
S01E01,JERRY,Doesnt matter. Whats the young mans name? I would like to meet him.
S01E01,ELAINE,"Hmmm, I dont think so."
S01E01,JERRY,"Well, what does he do? Is he an artisan, a craftsman, a labourer of some sort?"
S01E01,ELAINE,Wall street.
S01E01,JERRY,"Ah, high finance. Bulls, Bears, people from Conneticut."
S01E01,ELAINE,And he happens to be pretty good lookin.
S01E01,JERRY,"(pause) All right, sir."
S01E01,ELAINE,And... hes hilarious.
S01E01,JERRY,Now thats not fair! So where did you meet this guy?
S01E01,ELAINE,I staked out his health club.
S01E01,JERRY,"Uh huh. When youre on a stakeout, do you find its better to stand up against the wall, or kinda crouch down behind a big plant?"
S01E01,JERRY,"Yknow I think that even if youve had a relationship with someone, or lets say, especially if youve had a relationship with someone and you try to become friends afterwards, its very difficult. Isnt this? Its hard. Because, you know each other so well, you know all of each others tricks. Its like two magicians, trying to entertain each other. The one goes, Look, a rabbit. The other goes, So? I believe this is your card. Look, why dont we just saw each other in half and call it a night, okay?"
S01E02,JERRY,"So I move into the centre lane, now I get ahead of this women, who felt for some reason I guess, that she thought that I cut her off. So, she pulls up along side of me, gives me the finger. It seems like such an arbitrary, ridiculous thing to just pick a finger and you show it to the person. Its a finger, what does it mean? Someone shows me one of their fingers and Im supposed to feel bad. Is that the way its supposed to work? I mean, you could just give someone the toe, really, couldnt you? I would feel worse if I got the toe, than if I got the finger. Cause its not easy to give someone the toe, youve gotta get the shoe off, the sock off and drive, get it up and... (Jerry pretends to drive with one foot in the air, giving the toe.) Look at that toe, buddy. (He puts his foot down.) I mean, thats really insulting to get the toe, isnt it?"
S01E02,JERRY,"Is that it? Got the cue tips, got the mini-umbrella, something boring to read on the plane. (Jerry zips his bag ceremoniously.) Thats it. Done!"
S01E02,ELAINE,(claps her hands) That is the single greatest packing performance I have ever seen.
S01E02,JERRY,(proudly) I am...the master packer.
S01E02,ELAINE,"(laughs) Yeah, right, youre the master packer."
S01E02,JERRY,"What you must understand, Elaine, (picking up the umbrella) packing is no different than leading men into battle. (Jerry hits his bag rhythmically with his umbrella.) Youve gotta know the strengths and weaknesses of every soldier in that platoon. From a collapsible toothbrush to a pair of ordinary black socks."
S01E02,ELAINE,"(raising her hand) Scuse me, master packer..."
S01E02,JERRY,Yes.
S01E02,ELAINE,Just gimme your keys.
S01E02,JERRY,"All right, sir. (He tosses Elaine his keys. The apartment buzzer goes off; Jerry presses the first button; to the intercom) George?"
S01E02,GEORGE,(from the intercom) Yeah.
S01E02,ELAINE,"Okay, so, now, is there anything else I need to know about this place?"
S01E02,JERRY,"Uh, yeah, the, uh, hot water takes a little while to come on. So, the best thing to do is to turn it on, do all your shopping, you come back and take a shower."
S01E02,ELAINE,"Okay, this is quite a place."
S01E02,JERRY,Theres more. The refrigerator.
S01E02,JERRY,"Deduct a minimum of two days off all expiration dates. (He uses the umbrella to point to certain compartments in the fridge.) No meat, no leftovers, no butter. (He closes the fridge.) And I cannot overstate this No soft cheeses of any kind. Is that clear?"
S01E02,ELAINE,Ill eat out.
S01E02,JERRY,"One more thing, Benes, regarding sexual activity Strictly prohibited, but if you absolutely must, do us all a big favour. Do it in the tub."
S01E02,GEORGE,(to Jerry) Ready?
S01E02,JERRY,"Yeah, one sec."
S01E02,GEORGE,"Hey, Elaine."
S01E02,ELAINE,Hi.
S01E02,GEORGE,Coming to the airport with us?
S01E02,ELAINE,"No, Im staying here for the weekend. Im getting a break from my roommate."
S01E02,GEORGE,"Oh, the actress-waitress?"
S01E02,ELAINE,"No, the waitress-actress. She just got some part in some dinner theater production of A Chorus Line. So, now all day long shes walking around the apartment singing, God, I hope I get it, I hope I get it! Shes gonna get it right in her..."
S01E02,GEORGE,So just kick her out.
S01E02,ELAINE,Shes on the lease! George you have got to find another place for me.
S01E02,GEORGE,"Yeah, well...a little rough finding something good in your price-range. (to Jerry) But you, my friend, may be in luck."
S01E02,JERRY,Im not looking.
S01E02,GEORGE,"No no no, this ones different. This ones a beauty!"
S01E02,JERRY,"Yeah, whats it like?"
S01E02,GEORGE,"I havent seen it yet, but its a two-bedroom, its on the uh, west 83rd, bout a half block from the park?"
S01E02,JERRY,How much?
S01E02,GEORGE,"Uh, twice what youre payin here, but its a great building. Its two bedrooms!"
S01E02,JERRY,Two bedrooms? Why do I need two bedrooms? I got enough trouble maintaining activity in one. (George gives Elaine a look while Jerrys back is turned. Jerry turns around.) I saw that.
S01E02,ELAINE,You oughta at least take a look at it.
S01E02,JERRY,Really? Why?
S01E02,ELAINE,Cause then I could move in here.
S01E02,JERRY,Ohhhh...
S01E02,ELAINE,Its time you got outta here anyway.
S01E02,GEORGE,"Yeah, tell im. But quickly, Im double parked here."
S01E02,ELAINE,"Listen, Jerry, this place is falling apart. You have no hot water, you cant have soft cheese..."
S01E02,GEORGE,Lets not forget the radiator. The steam has been on here for ten years. No human can turn this off.
S01E02,ELAINE,"Jerry, come on, youre doin okay now. You should at least take a look at this place. You shouldnt have to live like this."
S01E02,JERRY,Like this? You just said you wanted to live here.
S01E02,ELAINE,"Well, for me its a step up. Its like moving from Iceland to Finland."
S01E02,GEORGE,"Jerry, what do you, you wanna, you wanna see the place or not?"
S01E02,JERRY,"I cant think about it now. Come on, Im going to Minneapolis. I got four shows this weekend."
S01E02,JERRY,"Elaine. (Jerry puts his bags down, sits down on the couch, picks up the remote control and points it at the spot the TV usually occupies. The TV is not there. He continues to point the remote at random things around the room, searching for the TV.) ELAINE!"
S01E02,ELAINE,"(from the bathroom) JERRY! (Elaine enters the living-room.) Jerry, oh, hi, welcome back. How were the shows?"
S01E02,JERRY,"Great, I had fun. Wheres the TV, wheres the VCR?"
S01E02,JERRY,What?
S01E02,ELAINE,They were stolen.
S01E02,JERRY,Stolen? When?
S01E02,ELAINE,A couple a hours ago. The police are coming right over.
S01E02,JERRY,Stolen?
S01E02,ELAINE,(looking at Kramer) Someone left the door open.
S01E02,JERRY,(to Kramer) You left the door open?!
S01E02,KRAMER,"Uh, Jer, well you know, I was cookin and I, I uh, I came in to get this spatula...and I left the door open, cause I was gonna bring the spatula right back!"
S01E02,JERRY,"Wait, you left the lock open or the door open?"
S01E02,KRAMER,(guiltily) The door.
S01E02,JERRY,The door? You left the door open?
S01E02,KRAMER,"Yeah, well, I was gonna bring the spatula right back."
S01E02,JERRY,"Yeah, and?"
S01E02,KRAMER,"Well, I got caught up... watching a soap opera. The Bold And The Beautiful."
S01E02,JERRY,So the door was wide open?
S01E02,KRAMER,Wide open!
S01E02,JERRY,(to Elaine) And where were you?
S01E02,ELAINE,I was at Bloomingdales... waiting for the shower to heat up.
S01E02,KRAMER,"Look, Jerry, Im sorry, Im uh- you have insurance, right buddy?"
S01E02,JERRY,No.
S01E02,KRAMER,(shocked) How can you not have insurance?
S01E02,JERRY,Because I spent my money on the Clapgo D-29. Its the most impenetrable lock on the market today. It has only one design flaw. The door... (Jerry pushes the door shut.) ...MUST BE CLOSED!!
S01E02,KRAMER,"Jerry! Im gonna find your stuff. Im gonna solve it, Im on the case, buddy, Im on the case."
S01E02,JERRY,"Yeah, dont investigate, dont pay me back, it was an accident."
S01E02,KRAMER,(theatrical) I made a mistake.
S01E02,ELAINE,These things happen.
S01E02,KRAMER,Im human.
S01E02,JERRY,In your way.
S01E02,POLICEMAN,"Lets see, thats, one TV, a stereo, one leather jacket, a VCR and a computer...is that bout it?"
S01E02,ELAINE,Answering machine.
S01E02,JERRY,"(disappointed) Answering machine. (jovially) Oh, I hate the idea of somebody out there returning my calls."
S01E02,POLICEMAN,What do you mean?
S01E02,JERRY,Its a joke.
S01E02,POLICEMAN,"I see. Well, mister Seinfeld uh, well look into it and uh, well let you know if we uh, you know, if we find anything."
S01E02,JERRY,You ever find anything?
S01E02,POLICEMAN,No.
S01E02,JERRY,"Well, thanks anyway."
S01E02,POLICEMAN,You bet.
S01E02,ELAINE,I didnt get that joke either.
S01E02,JERRY,The crook has the machine. The messages arent for him. Hes the crook. Why would he answer- (Jerry gives up on the explanation and turns around to see George standing behind him.) How did you get in here?
S01E02,GEORGE ,"I walked in, your lobby door is broken again."
S01E02,JERRY,Again?
S01E02,GEORGE,I dont know how you put up with this.
S01E02,ELAINE,"Yeah, tell im George."
S01E02,JERRY,(to Elaine) You would still wanna move in here?
S01E02,ELAINE,Yes! You dont understand. Im living with Ethel Merman without the talent.
S01E02,JERRY,"(to George) Is that uh, other apartment still available?"
S01E02,JERRY,"I got ripped off for about the...18th time? And now, the first couple a times you go through it, its very upsetting and your first reaction or one of your friends will say, Call the police. You really should call the police. So you think to yourself, you know, you watch TV, you think, Yeah, Im calling the police. Stakeouts, manhunts... Im gonna see some real action. Right, you think that. So, the police come over to your house, they fill out The Report. They give you Your Copy. Now, unless they give the crook his copy, I dont really think were gonna crack this case, do you? Its not like Batman, where theres three crooks in the city and everybody pretty much knows, who they are. Very few crooks even go to the trouble to come up with a theme for their careers anymore. It makes them a lot tougher to spot. Did you lose a sony? It could be the Penguin. I think we can round him up, hes dressed like a PENGUIN! We can find him, hes a PENGUIN!"
S01E02,ELAINE,"Oh, well, come on. This is an apartment, this is a home! This is a place to live. Oooh, a fireplace, are you kidding me! Does this work?"
S01E02,GEORGE,"I didnt know there was a fireplace. A fireplace, that's incredible."
S01E02,JERRY,How do you get all that wood in here?
S01E02,ELAINE,They deliver it.
S01E02,JERRY,They deliver wood?
S01E02,ELAINE,Yeah.
S01E02,JERRY,What do you tip a wood guy?
S01E02,GEORGE,I didnt know there was a fireplace.
S01E02,ELAINE,Look! Look at- look at this! Theres a garden.
S01E02,GEORGE,A garden! I cant believe theres a garden!
S01E02,JERRY,Would I have to get a gardener?
S01E02,ELAINE,"Yeah, you can get a gardener."
S01E02,JERRY,You tip him?
S01E02,ELAINE,You can.
S01E02,GEORGE,(to Elaine) You dont tip a gardener!
S01E02,ELAINE,You can tip a gardener.
S01E02,GEORGE,You dont need a gardener.
S01E02,ELAINE,"Jerry, you can barbecue back here."
S01E02,JERRY,They deliver the coal?
S01E02,ELAINE,"Sure, its...probably the same guy, who delivers the wood."
S01E02,JERRY,"Oh, then I gotta tip him."
S01E02,ELAINE,"Oh, damn, this place is incredible, look at all this great light!"
S01E02,JERRY,I dont have any plants.
S01E02,GEORGE,I have plants. (snorts)
S01E02,ELAINE,"Jerry, look at this closet! Look at this! Im walking in it! (Elaine walks into the closet.) Its a walk-in. Can you believe it? Im nuts about this, what do you think?"
S01E02,JERRY,"I like that. (He opens the closet. Elaine walks out with an angry look.) What do you think, George?"
S01E02,GEORGE,Its your decision.
S01E02,JERRY,"Im takin it, Im takin the place. Im gonna take it, this is gonna be my new place. Im livin here...Im movin."
S01E02,ELAINE,(laughing with joy) Your movin? That means Im movin. (She hugs Jerry.) Geeeeee (to George) isnt that incredible!
S01E02,GEORGE,(unenthusiastic) Congratulations.
S01E02,ELAINE,What about the couch?
S01E02,JERRY,You like the couch? Ill tell you what Im gonna do.
S01E02,ELAINE,What?
S01E02,JERRY,"Youre movin in, youre a good friend, I wanna start you off on the right foot. Give me...a hundred and fifty dollars. (Elaine is shocked, Jerry opens the door to the hall.) Get it outta here right now, take it out the door, I dont even wanna see it, go, get it out."
S01E02,ELAINE,A hundred and fifty dollars? A hundred and fifty dollars for what? For this couch?
S01E02,JERRY,Yeah!
S01E02,ELAINE,For this couch?!
S01E02,JERRY,"Okay, you tell me. What is it worth?"
S01E02,ELAINE,"Okay, uh, Ill tell you what. I could go as high as uh... (She takes a closer look at couch.) I dont know, maybe...twenty dollars?"
S01E02,JERRY,Yeah?
S01E02,GEORGE,"(from the intercom) Yeah, its George."
S01E02,JERRY,"Come on up. (Jerry presses the second button and opens the apartment door. He walks back to the couch.) Oh, all right, forget it, Im gonna take it with me now... (He picks up the cushions.) Im just gonna pack up the cushions right now..."
S01E02,ELAINE,"Okay okay okay okay, you win. Forty dollars."
S01E02,JERRY,"(continuing unphased) You wanna get the other end, cause I wanna get it in the hall."
S01E02,ELAINE,"Fifty dollars, okay? Fifty dollars, is that all right?"
S01E02,JERRY,Fifty dollars?
S01E02,ELAINE,Uh-huh.
S01E02,JERRY,Thank you very much.
S01E02,ELAINE,Thank you very much.
S01E02,GEORGE,"Hey, whats goin on?"
S01E02,ELAINE,I just bought Jerrys couch for fifty dollars.
S01E02,JERRY,"(to George) So did you bring the lease? (George takes the lease from his inside pocket and hands it to Jerry.) All right, gee, three years, that kinda seems like a long time."
S01E02,GEORGE,"(frantic) Oh, Jerry Jerry Jerry Jerry Jerry, listen, if, if you are feeling uncomfortable about this at all, at all. Do not feel like you have to take it."
S01E02,JERRY,Why?
S01E02,GEORGE,"If youre having second thoughts, if you didnt want it, dont worry about it because uh, you know, I, I...I could take it, you know."
S01E02,JERRY,You could take it? You want it?
S01E02,GEORGE,"No, I dont want it. I want it, if you dont want it."
S01E02,JERRY,So you do want it.
S01E02,GEORGE,"No I, I want it if you dont want it."
S01E02,JERRY,You just said you wanted it!
S01E02,GEORGE,"No, Im saying, if a situation arose in which you didnt want it, I might take it."
S01E02,JERRY,So take it.
S01E02,GEORGE,How can I take it?
S01E02,JERRY,How can I take it?
S01E02,GEORGE,Its your apartment!
S01E02,JERRY,"How can I want it now, if you want it?"
S01E02,ELAINE,"Excuse me, uh, I dont mean to cause any trouble here, but George, if you take it, can I take your place?"
S01E02,GEORGE,"Yes, but I am not taking it."
S01E02,JERRY,I...am not taking it.
S01E02,ELAINE,"Well, one of you better damn well take it!"
S01E02,JERRY,"Well, whaddaya wanna do here?"
S01E02,GEORGE,"I, I dont know."
S01E02,JERRY,Do you wanna flip a coin?
S01E02,GEORGE,"Who flips? Youll flip, Ill call."
S01E02,JERRY,"Okay, fine. (Jerry takes a coin from his pocket.) This is the official flip. No crying, no guilt, winner takes all and thats it. Agreed?"
S01E02,GEORGE,Im good.
S01E02,ELAINE,"I dont know, who to root for, Georges place has carpeting."
S01E02,JERRY,"All right, now you call it in the air."
S01E02,GEORGE,No catchin.
S01E02,JERRY,No no.
S01E02,GEORGE,Flip it.
S01E02,GEORGE,Heads!
S01E02,JERRY,Tails!
S01E02,GEORGE,"No, it hit the table, it hit the table."
S01E02,JERRY,So what?
S01E02,GEORGE,"Interference! You cant count that! Come on, are you crazy?! The coin cannot touch anything, it affects it."
S01E02,JERRY,You didnt call no interference!
S01E02,GEORGE,You dont have to call that! Thats a rule!
S01E02,JERRY,I dont believe this.
S01E02,GEORGE,"Oh oh oh, all right, fine, Jerry, you win. Take it, just take it!"
S01E02,JERRY,"I dont wanna win it like this! Elaine, what do you think?"
S01E02,ELAINE,Id better not.

S01E02,GEORGE,You got odds.
S01E02,JERRY,You got evens.
S01E02,GEORGE,"Right, ready?"
S01E02,JERRY,For the apartment.
S01E02,BOTH,"Once, twice, three, shoot!"
S01E02,JERRY,Mine!
S01E02,BOTH,"Once, twice, three, shoot!"
S01E02,JERRY,Mine!
S01E02,BOTH,"Once, twice, three, shoot!"
S01E02,GEORGE,Mine!
S01E02,BOTH,"Once, twice, three, shoot!"
S01E02,GEORGE,Congratulations...congratulations.
S01E02,JERRY,Thanks.
S01E02,GEORGE,I'm just gonna...wash. (George walks to the bathroom; screaming) WHY DID I PUT UP TWO? WHY DID I PUT UP TWO?
S01E02,KRAMER,"Jerry, I think Im on to something. I think I found your stuff. You know the Englishman who lives down the hall?"
S01E02,JERRY,Yeah.
S01E02,KRAMER,The last couple a days hes been acting very strange. I think hes avoiding me.
S01E02,JERRY,Hard to imagine.
S01E02,KRAMER,"Yeah! And get this I just got off the elevator with him and I tested him, I tested him, like I...this is what I said to him, like I, I was like this, I went, Oh, by the way, I know about the stuff."
S01E02,KRAMER,"..you know, very casually,"
S01E02,JERRY,Right.
S01E02,KRAMER,(cont'd) so that he was gonna take me into his confidence.
S01E02,ELAINE,So what did he say?
S01E02,KRAMER,What stuff?
S01E02,JERRY,"Ooh, (to Elaine) case closed!"
S01E02,KRAMER,"No, you dont understand, you see, he swallowed. See, the guy, he swallowed. Oh, he was nervous about something! Now, Im gonna go over there, Im gonna borrow some tea. If I dont get back in five minutes, maybe youd better call the police."
S01E02,JERRY,"Okay, starting...NOW!"
S01E02,KRAMER,Yeah!
S01E02,JERRY,"One of the problems in life is that when youre a kid, you have a certain way of working out disagreements. And those laws do not work in the adult world. One of the main ways that kids resolve any dispute is by calling it. One of them says, I got the front seat I wanted the front seat! I called it. And the other kid knows hes got nothing to say He called it. What can I do? If there was a Kid Court Of Law, it holds up. Your Honour, my client did ask for the front seat And the judge would go, Did he call it? Well no, he didnt call- BANG! (Jerry imitates a judge banging his gavel.) He has to call it, case closed. Objection overruled."
S01E02,GEORGE,I love the mirror in that bathroom! I dont know what in the hell it is. I look terrific in that mirror. (George sits.) I dont know if its the tile or the lighting... I feel like Robert Wagner.
S01E02,JERRY,"Its a good mirror. (They look at their menus.) So, what are you gettin?"
S01E02,GEORGE,"I dont know, I cant eat. You, you cant have anything anymore. Look at this, look at this. Eggs out. Coffee out. French fries out. BLT out! I go to visit my grandparents three big brisket sandwiches, Im sittin here with a carrot! Theyre closing in on a hundred, Im sayin to them, How can you eat that stuff? (They look at their menus again.) Im so sick about losin that choose, you dont know."
S01E02,JERRY,"All right, forget it, forget it. Im not taking the place!"
S01E02,GEORGE,What?!
S01E02,JERRY,How can I live there?
S01E02,GEORGE,Why not?!
S01E02,JERRY,"Look at you, youre still thinking about it. Ill never feel comfortable."
S01E02,GEORGE,"Oh, get outta here."
S01E02,JERRY,How can I ever have you over? Youll sit there moping.
S01E02,GEORGE,I wont mope.
S01E02,JERRY,Youre already moping! Would you take the place?
S01E02,GEORGE,"No, impossible! Its your apartment."
S01E02,JERRY,You found the place.
S01E02,GEORGE,You won the choose.
S01E02,JERRY,"All right, forget it, its over, Im not moving."
S01E02,GEORGE,"Well, me neither."
S01E02,JERRY,Definitely?
S01E02,GEORGE,Definitely.
S01E02,JERRY,"Alright, then just get rid of it. You wont have any problem."
S01E02,GEORGE,"No, its not a problem, I can get rid of the apartment this afternoon."
S01E02,CAROL,What apartment?
S01E02,GEORGE,"Oh, its a great place, its uh two-bedroom uh, west 83rd bout half block from the park."
S01E02,CAROL,Whats the rent?
S01E02,GEORGE,"I dont know, what were doin here, this is ridiculous."
S01E02,JERRY,She wanted to thank us for the apartment.
S01E02,ELAINE,I cant believe I lost the deposit on that U-Haul. And I threw out my couch.
S01E02,JERRY,If only the coin hadnt hit the table.
S01E02,GEORGE,"The table is interference, you know it!"
S01E02,JERRY,It is not!
S01E02,GEORGE,It is too!
S01E02,ELAINE,My roommate starts rehearsal tonight on Carousel.
S01E02,CAROL,Hi.
S01E02,GEORGE,"Hi, Carol."
S01E02,CAROL,"I just wanted to introduce you to my husband, this is Larry."
S01E02,CAROL,"This is George, Elaine and Jerry. These are the guys who got us the apartment."
S01E02,LARRY,"Oh, you dont know how grateful I am, if theres anything I can ever do to repay you, I, I mean, were just so thrilled with this place."
S01E02,CAROL,Its a dream.
S01E02,LARRY,"Im running in the park now, Ive lost weight, were barbecuing every night and the rent is unbelievable."
S01E02,GEORGE,Were really glad for you.
S01E02,ELAINE,Couldnt be happier.
S01E02,JERRY,Its wonderful.
S01E02,CAROL,"Diane, Diane, come here."
S01E02,CAROL,"This is my new next door neighbour, Diane."
S01E02,CAROL,"(to Diane) These are the guys, who turned this place down, can you believe it? (to Jerry, George and Elaine) Diane gave me the greatest backrub today. Shes a masseuse!"
S01E02,DIANE,"How, how could you guys have turned this place down, its such a great location and its...so close to the park."
S01E02,GEORGE,"Were aware of the proximity to the park, yes."
S01E02,DIANE,"Well, it was nice to meet you."
S01E02,GEORGE,Nice meeting you.
S01E02,JERRY,"How late are the stores open? Im thinking of maybe uh, buying a new TV and smash it over my head."
S01E02,MAN #1,"I get a call from Gilmour this morning, and get this theyre restructuring the organization in Atlanta and I gotta be there on the first of the month."
S01E02,MAN #2,Really? What are you gonna bout the apartment?
S01E02,MAN #1,"Well, what can I do? Give it up."
S01E02,"JERRY, GEORGE & ELAINE",Whats the rent?
S01E03,JERRY,"Most men like working on things. Tools, objects, fixing things. This is what men enjoy doing. Have you ever noticed a guys out in his driveway working on something with tools, how all the other men in the neighborhood are magnetically drawn to this activity. They just come wandering out of the house like zombies. Men, its true, men hear a drill, its like a dog whistle. Just... (his head perks up) you know, they go running up to that living room curtain, Honey, I think Jims working on something over there. So they run over to the guy. Now they dont actually help the guy. No, they just want to hang around the area where work is being done. Thats what men want to do. We want to watch the guy, we want to talk to him, we want to ask him dumb questions. You know, What are you using, a Phillips-head? You know, we feel involved. Thats why when they have construction sites, they have to have those wood panel fences around it, thats just to keep the men out. They cut those little holes for us so we can see what the hell is going on. But if they dont cut those holes, we are climbing those fences. Right over there. What are you using the steel girders down there? Yeah, thatll hold."
S01E03,GEORGE,I had to say something. (chuckles) I had to say something. Everything was going so well. I had to say something.
S01E03,JERRY,I dont think you did anything wrong.
S01E03,GEORGE,I told her I liked her. Why? Why did I tell her I like her? I have this sick compulsion to tell women how I feel. I like you I dont tell you.
S01E03,JERRY,We can only thank God for that.
S01E03,GEORGE,Im outta the picture. I am outta the picture. (laughs) Its only a matter of time now.
S01E03,JERRY,Youre imagining this. Really.
S01E03,GEORGE,"Oh, no. No no no no."
S01E03,GEORGE,Ill tell you when it happened. When that floss came flying out of my pocket.
S01E03,JERRY,What floss? When?
S01E03,GEORGE,"We were in the lobby during the intermission of the play. I was buying her one of those containers of orange drink, for five dollars. I reached into my pocket to pay for it, I looked down; theres this piece of green floss hanging from my fingers."
S01E03,JERRY,"Ah, mint."
S01E03,GEORGE,"Of course. So, Im looking at it. I look up, I see shes looking at it. Our eyes lock. It was a horrible moment. I just.."
S01E03,JERRY,"So let me get this straight. She saw the floss, you panicked and you told her you liked her."
S01E03,GEORGE,"If I didnt put that floss in my pocket, Id be crawling around her bedroom right now looking for my glasses."
S01E03,JERRY,And youre sure the floss was the catalyst?
S01E03,GEORGE,"Yes, I am."
S01E03,JERRY,You dont think it mightve had anything to do with that?
S01E03,GEORGE,What? You dont like this?
S01E03,JERRY,It looks like your belt is digesting a small animal.
S01E03,KRAMER,"(to the phone) Oh, theyve got a cure for cancer. See, its all big business. Oh hey, Jerry just walked in. Hi, George. (to the phone again) Yeah yeah yeah yeah take my number. 555-8643. Okay, here he is."
S01E03,JERRY,(to Kramer) Who is it?
S01E03,KRAMER,Take it.
S01E03,JERRY,Who is it?
S01E03,KRAMER,Its for you.
S01E03,JERRY,"(to the phone) Hello? (disappointed) Oh, hi Joel. (Jerry hits Kramer with a magazine.) No. Uh, I was out of town. I just got back. Kramer doesnt know anything. Hes just my next-door neighbor. Uh, nothing much... Tuesday? Uh, Tuesday, no. Im meeting somebody... Uh, Wednesday? Wednesdays okay... All right. Uh, Im a little busy right now. Can we talk Wednesday morning?... Okay... Yeah... Right... Thanks... Bye. (Jerry hangs up; to Kramer) Why did you put me on the phone with him? I hate just being handed a phone."
S01E03,KRAMER,"Well, its your phone. He wanted to talk to you."
S01E03,JERRY,Maybe I didnt want to talk to him.
S01E03,KRAMER,"Well, why not?"
S01E03,JERRY,He bothers me. I dont even answer the phone anymore because of him. Hes turned me into a screener. Now I gotta go see him on Wednesday.
S01E03,GEORGE,What do you mean Wednesday? I though we had tickets to the Knick game Wednesday. We got seats behind the bench! What happened? Were not going?
S01E03,JERRY,Were going. Thats next Wednesday.
S01E03,GEORGE,Oh. Who is this guy?
S01E03,JERRY,His name is Joel Horneck. He lived like three houses down from me when I grew up. He had a Ping Pong table. We were friends. Should I suffer the rest of my life because I like to play Ping Pong? I was ten. I wouldve been friends with Stalin if he had a Ping Pong table. Hes so self-involved.
S01E03,KRAMER,"Thats for me. (to the phone) Kramerica Industries. Oh, hi, Mark. No no no. Forget that. I got a better idea. A pizza place where you make your own pie..."
S01E03,JERRY,Can you conduct your business elsewhere?
S01E03,KRAMER,(ignoring Jerry) No no no. Im talking about a whole chain of em. Yeah.
S01E03,GEORGE,"I dont know why you even bother with this ping pong guy, Ill tell you that."
S01E03,JERRY,I dont bother with him. Hes been calling me for seven years. Ive never called him once! Hes got the attention span of a five-year-old. Sometimes I sit there and I make up things just to see if hes paying attention.
S01E03,GEORGE,I dont understand why you spend time with this guy.
S01E03,JERRY,"What can I do? Break up with him? Tell him, I dont think were right for each other. Hes a guy! At least with a woman, theres a precendent. You know, the relationship goes sour, you end it."
S01E03,GEORGE,"No no no no, you have to approach this as if he was a woman."
S01E03,JERRY,Just break up with him?
S01E03,GEORGE,Absolutely. You just tell him the truth.
S01E03,JERRY,The Truth.
S01E03,JERRY,"As a guy I dont know how I can break up with another guy. You know what I mean? I dont know how to say, Bill, I feel I need to see other men. Do you know what I mean? Theres nothing I can do. I have to wait for someone to die. I think thats the only way out of this relationship. It could be a long time. See, the great thing about guys is that we can become friends based on almost nothing. Just two guys will just become friends just because theyre two guys. Thats almost all we need to have in common. Cause sports  sports and women  is really all we talk about. If there was no sports and no women the only thing guys would ever say is, So, whats in the refrigerator?"
S01E03,JOEL,"...so my shrink wants me to bring my mother in for a session. This guy is a brilliant man. Lenny Bruce used to go to him. And I think, uh, Geraldo."
S01E03,JERRY,"You know, I read the Lenny Bruce biography, I thought it was really... interesting. He would-"
S01E03,JOEL,"(to the counter of the restaurant) Hey hey hey hey, were starving here! Weve been waiting here for ten minutes already!"
S01E03,JERRY,"(testing Joel) So, Im thinking about going to Iran this summer."
S01E03,JOEL,"I have to eat! I mean, Im hypoglycemic."
S01E03,JERRY,"Anyway, the Hizballah has invited me to perform. (Joel shakes his head agreeing; Jerry smiles) You know, its their annual terrorist luncheon."
S01E03,JOEL,Yeah.
S01E03,JERRY,(cont'd) Im gonna do it in Farsi.
S01E03,JOEL,Do you think I need a haircut?
S01E03,CLAIRE,Are you ready?
S01E03,JERRY,"Yeah, Ill have the egg salad on whole wheat."
S01E03,JOEL,"(to the waitress) Let me ask you a question. This, uh, this turkey sandwich here, is that real turkey, or is it a turkey roll? I dont want that processed turkey. (to Jerry) I hate it."
S01E03,WAITRESS,I think its real turkey.
S01E03,JOEL,Is there a real bird in the back?
S01E03,WAITRESS,"No, theres not bird but-"
S01E03,JOEL,"Well, how do you know for sure? Look, why dont you do me a favor. Why dont you go in the back and find out, okay? (The waitress leaves.) Unbelievable."
S01E03,JERRY,How can you talk to someone like that?
S01E03,JOEL,"What are you saying? What, you like turkey roll?"
S01E03,JERRY,"Listen, Joel. Theres something I have to tell you..."
S01E03,JOEL,"(laughing) Wait, youll never guess who I ran into."
S01E03,JERRY AND JOEL,Howard Metro.
S01E03,JOEL,"He asked me if I still saw you. I said, Sure, I see him all the time. Were still great friends. Anyway, Howard says hello. (laughs)"
S01E03,JERRY,"Listen, Joel, I dont think we should see each other anymore."
S01E03,JOEL,What?
S01E03,JERRY,This friendship Its not working.
S01E03,JOEL,Not working? What are you talking about?
S01E03,JERRY,Were just not suited to be friends.
S01E03,JOEL,How can you say that?
S01E03,JERRY,"Look, youre a nice guy, its just that... we dont have anything in common."
S01E03,JOEL,(starting to cry) Wai-Wait. What did I do? Tell me. I want to know what I did.
S01E03,JERRY,"Y-You didnt do anything. Its not you, its me. Its- this is very difficult."
S01E03,JOEL,"Look, I know I call you too much, right? I mean, I know youre a very busy guy."
S01E03,JERRY,"No, its not that."
S01E03,JOEL,(crying) Youre one of the few people I can talk to.
S01E03,JERRY,"Oh, come on. Thats not true."
S01E03,JOEL,"I always tell everybody about you. Tell everybody to (to the rest of the coffee shop) GO SEE HIS SHOW! (to Jerry) I mean, Im your biggest fan!"
S01E03,JERRY,"I know, I know."
S01E03,JOEL,"I mean, youre my best friend."
S01E03,JERRY,Best friend- Ive never been to your apartment.
S01E03,JOEL,I cannot believe that this is happening. I cant believe it.
S01E03,JERRY,"Okay, okay. Forget it. Its okay. I didnt mean it."
S01E03,JOEL,Didnt mean what?
S01E03,JERRY,What I said. Ive been under a lot of stress.
S01E03,JOEL,"Oh, youve been under a lot of stress."
S01E03,JERRY,"Just, can we just forget the whole thing ever happend? Im sorry. I didnt mean it. I took it out on you. Were still friends. Were still friends. Still friends. Okay? Look, Ill tell you what. Ive got Knick tickets this Wednesday. Great seats behind the bench. You want to come with me? Come on."
S01E03,JOEL,Tonight?
S01E03,JERRY,"No, next Wednesday. If it was tonight, I wouldve said tonight."
S01E03,JOEL,Do you really want me to go?
S01E03,JERRY,(lying) Yes.
S01E03,JOEL,"Okay. (Jerry gives him some napkins to clean himself up) Yeah, okay. Great! That would be, thatd be great. So, next Wednesday."
S01E03,JERRY,Next Wednesday.
S01E03,JOEL,Where is that waitress? (to the counter) Hey!
S01E03,GEORGE,...she calls me up at my office
S01E03,JERRY,Yeah.
S01E03,GEORGE,"(cont'd) she says, We have to talk."
S01E03,JERRY,"Ugh, the four worst words in the English language."
S01E03,GEORGE,"That, or Whos bra is this?"
S01E03,JERRY,That is worse.
S01E03,GEORGE,"So we order lunch, and were talking. Finally, she blurts out how its not working."
S01E03,JERRY,Really.
S01E03,GEORGE,"So, Im thinking, as shes saying this, Im thinking great, the relationships over. But the egg salads on the way. So now I have a decision Do I walk or do I eat?"
S01E03,JERRY,Hm. You ate.
S01E03,GEORGE,"We sat there for twenty minutes, chewing, staring at each other in a defunct relationship."
S01E03,JERRY,"Someone says, Get out of my life, and that doesnt affect your appetite?"
S01E03,GEORGE,Have you ever had their egg salad?
S01E03,JERRY,It is unbelievable.
S01E03,GEORGE,Its unbelievable. You know what else is unbelievable? I picked up the check. She didnt even offer. She ended it. The least she could do is send me off with a sandwich.
S01E03,JERRY,How much could you possibly have in there?
S01E03,GEORGE,Its my money. What should I do? Throw it out the window? I know a guy who took his vacation on his change.
S01E03,JERRY,"Yeah? Whered he go, to an arcade?"
S01E03,GEORGE,(sarcastically) Thats funny. Youre a funny guy.
S01E03,JERRY,"Cmon, move up."
S01E03,CUSTOMER,"Oh great, Ewings hurt."
S01E03,GEORGE,Ewings hurt? How long is he going to be out?
S01E03,CUSTOMER,A couple of days at the most but...
S01E03,GEORGE,Geez.
S01E03,JERRY,"Oh, God."
S01E03,GEORGE,I got scared there for a second. The Knicks without Ewing.
S01E03,JERRY,"Listen, George, little problem with the game."
S01E03,GEORGE,What about it?
S01E03,JERRY,"The thing is, yesterday, I kind of.. uh.."
S01E03,GEORGE,What?
S01E03,JERRY,I gave your ticket to Horneck.
S01E03,GEORGE,(not believing him) You what?!
S01E03,JERRY,"Yeah, Im sorry. I had to give it to Horneck."
S01E03,GEORGE,No! My ticket?! You gave my ticket to Horneck?
S01E03,JERRY,"Cmon, cmon, go ahead, move up."
S01E03,GEORGE,Why did you give him my ticket for?
S01E03,JERRY,You didnt see him. It was horrible.
S01E03,GEORGE,"Oh, cmon, Jerry. I cant believe this."
S01E03,JERRY,I had to do it.
S01E03,GEORGE,"Oh, please. (to the teller) Can you change this into bills?"
S01E03,TELLER,"Im sorry, sir. We cant do that."
S01E03,JERRY,Do you want to go with him? You go. I dont mind.
S01E03,GEORGE,"Im not going with him. I dont even know the guy. (to the teller) Look, they did this for me before."
S01E03,TELLER,"Look, I can give you these and you can roll them yourself."
S01E03,GEORGE,"You want me to roll six thousand of these?! What, should I quit my job?!"
S01E03,JERRY,"No, I do not like the bank. Ive heard the expression Laughing all the way to the bank. I have never seen anyone actually doing it. And those bank lines. I hate it when theres nobody on the line at all, you know that part, you go to the bank, its empty and you still have to go through the little maze. (walking on the stage like he is going through a maze) Can you get a little piece of cheese for me? Im almost at the front. Id like a reward for this please."
S01E03,GEORGE,"...thirty-two, thirty-three-"
S01E03,JERRY,George.
S01E03,GEORGE,Not now.
S01E03,JERRY,Could you stop the counting?
S01E03,GEORGE,Nnnnnnngaaa!
S01E03,GEORGE,What?!
S01E03,JERRY,Can I make it up to you? Ill give you fifty bucks for the jug.
S01E03,GEORGE,"Oh, yeah, sure. Keep your money."
S01E03,JERRY,"Well, then Im not going to the game either. Okay? Ill give him both tickets."
S01E03,GEORGE,"Oh geeeee. (George pantomimes sticking a knife in his heart, and twists it.) Go, go!"
S01E03,JERRY,"I- no, I dont want to go."
S01E03,GEORGE,He was really crying?
S01E03,JERRY,"I had to give him a tissue. In fact, let me call his machine now and Ill just make up some excuse why I cant go to the game either."
S01E03,GEORGE,"Wait a minute. Wait a minute. As long as youre going to lie to the guy, why dont you tell him that you lost both of the tickets, then we can go?"
S01E03,JERRY,"George, the man wept."
S01E03,KRAMER,"Oh, hey guys. Man, Im telling you, this pizza idea, is really going to happen."
S01E03,GEORGE,This is the thing where you go and you have to make your own pizza?
S01E03,KRAMER,"Yeah, we give you the dough, you smash it, you pound it, you fling it in the air. And then you get to put your sauce and you get to sprinkle your cheese, and then- you slide it into the oven."
S01E03,GEORGE,"You know, you have to know how to do that. You cant have people shoving their arms into a six-hundred degree oven!"
S01E03,KRAMER,Its all supervised.
S01E03,GEORGE,"Oh, well..."
S01E03,KRAMER,All of it. You want to invest?
S01E03,GEORGE,My moneys all tied up in change right now.
S01E03,KRAMER,"No, Im tellin you, people, they really want to make their own pizza pie."
S01E03,JERRY,"I-I have to say something. With all due respect, I just never- I cant imagine anyone in any walk of life, under any circumstance, wanting to make their own pizza pie... but thats me. Alright"
S01E03,KRAMER,Thats you.
S01E03,JERRY,Im just saying..Alright.
S01E03,KRAMER,"Okay, okay. I just wanted to check with you guys."
S01E03,JERRY,Okay.
S01E03,KRAMER,"You know, this business is going to be big. I just wanted- okay."
S01E03,KRAMER,"One day, youll beg me to make your own pie."
S01E03,JERRY,"(to the phone) Hi, Joel. This is Jerry. I hope you get this before you- Oh, Hi. Joel... Oh, you just came in... Listen, I cant make it to the game tonight... I, uh, have to tutor my nephew... Yeah, hes got an exam tomorrow... Geometry... You know, trapezoids, rhombus... Anyway, listen, you take the tickets. Theyre at the Will-Call window... And Im really sorry... Have a good time... Well talk next week... Okay... Yeah, I dont... Fine.. Fine... Bye."
S01E03,GEORGE,Trapezoid?
S01E03,JERRY,I know. Im really running out of excuses with this guy. I need some kind of excuse rolodex.
S01E03,ELAINE,"Come on, lets go do something. I dont wanna just sit around here."
S01E03,JERRY,Okay.
S01E03,ELAINE,Want to go get something to eat?
S01E03,JERRY,Where do you want to go?
S01E03,ELAINE,"I dont care, Im not hungry."
S01E03,JERRY,We could go to one of those uh cappuccino places. They let you just sit there.
S01E03,ELAINE,What are we gonna do there? Talk?
S01E03,JERRY,We could talk.
S01E03,ELAINE,Ill go if I dont have to talk.
S01E03,JERRY,Then well just sit there.
S01E03,ELAINE,"Okay. Im gonna check my machine first. (Elaine sees a pad of paper by the phone; reading) Picking someone up at the airport, jury duty, waiting for cable guy..."
S01E03,JERRY,"Okay, just hand that over, please."
S01E03,ELAINE,"Oh, what is this?"
S01E03,JERRY,"Its a list of excuses, its for that guy, Horneck, whos at the game tonight with my tickets. I have that list now so in case he calls, I just consult it and I dont have to see him. (Elaine laughs.) I need it. (Elaine starts writing on the list.) What are you doing?"
S01E03,ELAINE,I got some for you.
S01E03,JERRY,I dont need any more.
S01E03,ELAINE,"No no no no no, these are good. Listen, listen You ran out of underwear, you cant leave the house."
S01E03,JERRY,(not amused) Very funny.
S01E03,ELAINE,How about Youve been diagnosed as a multiple personality. Youre not even you. Youre Dan.
S01E03,JERRY,"Im Dan. Can I have my list back, please?"
S01E03,ELAINE,"Here, here. Jerry Seinfeld, I cannot believe youre doing this. This is absolutely infantile."
S01E03,JERRY,What can I do?
S01E03,ELAINE,Deal with it. Be a man!
S01E03,JERRY,Oh no. Thats impossible. Id rather lie to him for the rest of my life that go through that again. He was crying. Tears. Accompanied by mucus.
S01E03,ELAINE,You made a man cry? Ive never made a man cry. I even kicked a guy in the groin once and he didnt cry. I got the cab.
S01E03,JERRY,Couple of tough monkeys.
S01E03,KRAMER,"Oh, hi Elaine, hey. (to Jerry) Hey, you missed a great game tonight, buddy!"
S01E03,JERRY,Game?
S01E03,KRAMER,Knick game. Horneck took me. We were sitting two rows behind the bench. We're getting hit by sweat!
S01E03,JERRY,Wait. How does Horneck know you?
S01E03,KRAMER,"Last week. When I, you know, gave you the phone. Hes really into my pizza place idea!"
S01E03,JERRY,This is too much.
S01E03,ELAINE,"Wait, what pizza place idea?"
S01E03,JERRY,"Oh, no."
S01E03,KRAMER,You get to make your own pie!
S01E03,ELAINE,"Oh, that sounds like a great idea. It would be fun."
S01E03,KRAMER,Yea.
S01E03,JOEL,(from the hallway) Kramer.
S01E03,KRAMER,Yeah.
S01E03,JERRY,Perfect.
S01E03,JOEL,Hey.
S01E03,KRAMER,"Okay, who wants meatloaf?"
S01E03,JERRY & ELAINE,No thanks.
S01E03,KRAMER,(to Joel) Its gonna be hot in a minute.
S01E03,JOEL,"So, I though you were tutoring your nephew?"
S01E03,JERRY,"Oh, we finished early."
S01E03,JOEL,"M-hm, Ill bet. So, are you going to introduce me to your nephew?"
S01E03,JERRY,"Elaine Benes, this is Joel Horneck."
S01E03,ELAINE,Hi.
S01E03,JOEL,"Whoa, Nelson! This is Elaine? I though you guys split?"
S01E03,JERRY,Were still friends.
S01E03,JOEL,"So, thanks again for those tickets. But next week, Im going to take you. How about next Tuesday night? (to Elaine) And why dont you come along?"
S01E03,ELAINE,"Oh, no no. Tuesdays uh no good becasue weve got choir practice."
S01E03,JERRY,Right. I forgot about choir.
S01E03,ELAINE,We-Were doing that evening of Eastern European National Anthems.
S01E03,JERRY,"Right. You know, the Wall being down and everything."
S01E03,JOEL,What about Thursday night? I mean theyre playing the Sonics.
S01E03,ELAINE,Huh... Thursday is no good because weve got to get to the hospital to see if we qualify as those organ donors.
S01E03,JOEL,"You know, I should really try something like that."
S01E03,JERRY,You really should.
S01E03,JOEL,"Well, lets just take a look here."
S01E03,JOEL,"Forty-one home games. Let's see saturday night weve got the Mavericks. If you dont like the Mavericks, next Tuesday Lakers. I mean, you gotta like Magic, right? Lets see, on the road, on the road, on the road, on the road, back on the fourteenth. They play the Bulls. You cant miss Air Jordan..."
S01E03,JERRY,"You know, I really... Ive come to the conclusion that there are certain friends in your life that theyre just always your friends, and you have to accept it. You see them, you dont really wanna see them. You dont call them, they call you. You dont call back, they call again. The only way to get through talking with people that you dont really have anything in common with is to pretend youre hosting your own little talk show. This is what I do. You pretend theres a little desk around you. The only problem with this is theres no way you can say, Hey, its been great having you on the show. Were out of time."
S01E04,JERRY,"Went out to dinner the other night. Check came at the end of the meal, as it always does. Never liked the check at the end of the meal system, because moneys a very different thing before and after you eat. Before you eat, money has no value. And you dont care about money when youre hungry. You sit down at a restaurant, youre like the ruler of an empire. More drinks, appetizers, quickly, quickly! It will be the greatest meal of our lives. Then after the meal, you know, youve got the pants open, youve got the napkins destroyed, cigarette butt in the mashed potatoes. Then the check comes at that moment. People are always upset, you know. Theyre mystified by the check. What is this? How could this be? They start passing it around the table, Does this look right to you? Were not hungry now. Why are we buying all this food?"
S01E04,JERRY,I think Superman probably has a very good sense of humor.
S01E04,GEORGE,I never heard him say anything really funny.
S01E04,JERRY,"But its common sense. Hes got super strength, super speed. Im sure hes got super humor."
S01E04,GEORGE,"You would think that, but either youre born with a sense of humor, or youre not. Its not going to change even if you go from the red sun of Krypton all the way to the yellow sun of the Earth."
S01E04,JERRY,Why? Why would that one area of his mind not be affected by the yellow sun of Earth?
S01E04,GEORGE,I dont know. But he aint funny.
S01E04,ELAINE,"I know, I know. Im sorry Im late."
S01E04,JERRY,No problem.
S01E04,ELAINE,I dropped a grape.
S01E04,GEORGE,Pardon?
S01E04,ELAINE,"I dropped a grape in the kitchen and it disappeared. I couldnt find it. I was, I was literally on my knees for ten minutes looking for this stupid grape. I have no idea where it went."
S01E04,JERRY,"Were you crying? I mean, its just a grape. Youll find it."
S01E04,ELAINE,"No, Im just getting over an allergy attack. This guy Im going out with..."
S01E04,JERRY,Robert.
S01E04,ELAINE,"Robert. Yes. Thank you. He has two cats and Im allergic to them. You know, I finally meet a normal man, and I cant even go into his apartment, you know. And, of course, my apartment is the actors studio so we cant go there. Its really causing a lot of problems, you know. He wont even go away for the weekend because of these cats."
S01E04,GEORGE,Guys with cats... I dont know.
S01E04,JERRY,"Ive been thinking about asking this girl Im, uh, seeing-"
S01E04,ELAINE,Vanessa.
S01E04,JERRY,"Vanessa, thank you. Ive been thinking about asking her to go away for a couple of days."
S01E04,GEORGE,"Oh, no. No no no no no. Id have to advise against that. What, do you know this woman a month? Lets see, youre going to be with her seventy-two hours. Thats a dating decathlon."
S01E04,ELAINE,"(balancing a spoon on her nose) Hey, why dont you take her to that place in Vermont I was telling you about? You know, that really charming place with the separate faucets for the hot and cold. Shell love it."
S01E04,GEORGE,"Thats exquisite. Listen, uh, if its not too much trouble, could you pass me that paper over there?"
S01E04,JERRY,"You better find that grape before it mutates into another life form. There was once a mutant grape that terrorized an entire town in the Texas panhandle. They brought in the army, nobody could stop it. Apparently it had a pit of steel."
S01E04,GEORGE,Up again?! This is incredible! Im.. Im getting it.
S01E04,ELAINE,Youre getting what?
S01E04,GEORGE,A stock.
S01E04,JERRY,What stock?
S01E04,GEORGE,"Did you ever meet my friend, Simons?"
S01E04,JERRY,Maybe.
S01E04,GEORGE,"He knows this guy, Wilkinson. He made a fortune in the stock market. Now hes got some new thing. You know, theres supposed to be a big merger. He wasnt even supposed to say anything. You guys should think about doing this too."
S01E04,JERRY,How highs it suppose to go?
S01E04,GEORGE,"I dont know. But Simons said that if I wanted to get involved, that Wilkinson would tell me the exact right minute to sell. You wanna do it?"
S01E04,JERRY,Boy... I dont know.
S01E04,ELAINE,Id do it but I dont have any money.
S01E04,JERRY,What kind of company is it?
S01E04,GEORGE,Its called Sendrax. Theyve got some new kind of technique for televising opera.
S01E04,ELAINE,Televising opera?
S01E04,GEORGE,Some sort of electronic thingy.
S01E04,JERRY,"Well, how much are you going to invest?"
S01E04,GEORGE,Five thousand... Ten. Ten thousand. Five thousand.
S01E04,JERRY,Boy...
S01E04,GEORGE,Cmon. Wilkinsons got millions invested in this stock. Its gone up three points since Ive been watching it.
S01E04,JERRY,What if I lose it?
S01E04,GEORGE,"Cmon, go for twenty-five hundred. Well do it together. Come on, come on. Were in it together."
S01E04,JERRY,All right. Twenty-five hundred.
S01E04,GEORGE,Thats it.
S01E04,WAITRESS,"Yeah, can I take your order?"
S01E04,GEORGE,(Gesturing to Jerry) Check the raiser.
S01E04,JERRY,My bet? All right. Ill open with a tuna sandwich.
S01E04,ELAINE,Tuna?
S01E04,JERRY,"Oh, the dolphin thing?"
S01E04,ELAINE,Theyre dying in the nets.
S01E04,JERRY,"Ohhh... You know, the whole concept of lunch is based on tuna."
S01E04,ELAINE,"Jerry, cant you incorporate one unselfish act in your daily routine?"
S01E04,JERRY,"Hey, when Im driving, I let people in ahead of me all the time. Im always waving everybody in. Go ahead, go ahead, go ahead. ...All right. All right. Ill have a chicken salad."
S01E04,ELAINE,And Im going to have an English muffin with margarine on the side and a cup of coffee.
S01E04,WAITRESS,Okay. (To George) What about you?
S01E04,GEORGE,Ill have the tuna.
S01E04,JERRY,"I have to say, those people talking behind us really ruined that movie for me."
S01E04,VANESSA,Why didnt you do something?
S01E04,JERRY,"What do you want me to do? I gave the guy the half-turn. (acts like he did in the movie) Then I gave him the full-turn with the eye roll. (does the next look) I mean, beyond that, Im risking a punch in the mouth. (To a stock boy) Excuse me, do you have these in the puffs?"
S01E04,STOCK BOY,No puffs. Just flakes.
S01E04,JERRY ,Have you thought any more about that trip?
S01E04,VANESSA,"Yeah, Ive been thinking about it."
S01E04,JERRY,"You know, my friend told me about this great place in Vermont."
S01E04,VANESSA,I dont know. I just worry about trips like this. Its a lot of pressure.
S01E04,JERRY,Its great! It speeds up the intimacy level. Its like putting the relationship in a time compressor. Where we would be six months from now we accomplish (snaps his fingers) three days.
S01E04,VANESSA,"Oh, so you want to move our relationship into Phase Two?"
S01E04,JERRY,"Exactly. I love Phase Two. Extra toothbrushes, increased phone call frequency, walking around naked. You know, the presents get a lot better in Phase Two."
S01E04,VANESSA,Really? Could we go fishing up there?
S01E04,JERRY,"Yeah. We can fish. What? Blues, carp, marlin?"
S01E04,VANESSA,They have marlin in Vermont?
S01E04,JERRY,"Oh, big fighting marlin. (Jerry acts like he is catching a marlin)"
S01E04,VANESSA,"Jerry, the stock is the same as when you checked it earlier. There are no changes after the market closes. The stock is still down."
S01E04,JERRY ,"I know. But this is a different paper. I thought maybe they have, uh, different... sources."
S01E04,JERRY,Is that my paper?
S01E04,KRAMER,"Bad news, my friend."
S01E04,JERRY,What? What news?
S01E04,KRAMER ,Sendrax.
S01E04,JERRY,"Oh, cmon! Its down again?!"
S01E04,KRAMER,Two and a half points.
S01E04,JERRY,"Oh, I cant believe it. Let me see that. (Jerry takes the paper.) Thats four and a half points in three days! Thats almost half my money!"
S01E04,KRAMER,"Hey, I told you."
S01E04,JERRY,"(sarcastic) Yeah, you told me."
S01E04,KRAMER,Its all manipulated with junk bonds. You cant win.
S01E04,JERRY,"Theres one thing I dont understand. Why does it please you? (to the phone) George Costanza, please."
S01E04,KRAMER,"Hey, I dont care. Im just telling you to (yelling) get rid of that stock, now!"
S01E04,JERRY,"(to the phone) George, whats going on?!"
S01E04,KRAMER,"Sell it, just say Im selling!"
S01E04,JERRY,"(to the phone) Well, where is the guy?!... Nothing?! Almost half my moneys gone... Well, call me right back. (Jerry hangs up.) Nobody can reach Wilkinson. He hasnt been home or in his office in the past three days!"
S01E04,KRAMER,"You know, I cant believe you put your money in that Sendrax. And you couldve invested in my roll-out tie dispenser."
S01E04,JERRY,Roll-out tie dispenser? What was that one?
S01E04,KRAMER,"Okay, youre in a restaurant. Youve got a very big meeting coming up..."
S01E04,JERRY,Okay...
S01E04,KRAMER,"(looks at his shirt as if he had a tie on) Oh man, you got mustard on your tie!"
S01E04,JERRY,(going along with it) Oh No!
S01E04,KRAMER,"You just (makes the tearing sound) tear it off, and vvvvrrrpppp you got a new one right here. Then youre gone."
S01E04,JERRY,Youre gone all right.
S01E04,KRAMER,"(Looking at map) Hey, where, where are you going? You gonna take a trip? The map... what..."
S01E04,JERRY,"Yeah, Im going to Vermont with uh Vanessa for a few days."
S01E04,KRAMER,"Hey, can I use your place? I got a bunch of friends coming over this weekend."
S01E04,JERRY,What friends?
S01E04,KRAMER,"Well, its just some people I met at a rock concert. (Phone rings.) Do you mind if they use your bed? (Jerry give Kramer a look.) Cause theyre really good people, Jerry. Im telling you. You know, theyre anarchists. Theyre.. theyre.. theyre.. huge."
S01E04,JERRY,"George- What?! Youre kidding... Well, whats wrong?... So, what are we gonna do?... Great!... All right, Ill speak to you later. (He hangs up.) Wilkinson, the guy whos supposed to tell us when to sell the stock, hes in the hospital."
S01E04,JERRY,So you dont know whats wrong with him?
S01E04,GEORGE,All Simons was able to find out is that hes in the hospital.
S01E04,JERRY,"Okay, fine. Has Simons been in touch with him?"
S01E04,GEORGE,"Of course hes been in touch with him. Hes left two messages. He just hasnt heard back yet, thats all."
S01E04,JERRY,"Well, this is it. Im selling."
S01E04,GEORGE,Just give it a little more time.
S01E04,JERRY,I never shouldve gotten involved in this. Im a nervous wreck. Im not cut out for investing.
S01E04,GEORGE,"All right, all right. Thats it. Im gonna go down there."
S01E04,JERRY,Where?
S01E04,GEORGE,To the hospital.
S01E04,JERRY,The hospital?
S01E04,GEORGE,Im going to find out whats going on. All right?
S01E04,JERRY,Are you nuts? You dont even know the guy.
S01E04,GEORGE,"So what? Ill start talking to him, you know, casual, and Ill work my way around to it."
S01E04,JERRY,"What if hes in an iron lung or something? What are you gonna do? (Jerry knocks on imaginary glass.) How you feeling, Mr. Wilkinson? (He makes a hissing sound.) By the way, whats happening with Sendrax?"
S01E04,GEORGE,Maybe hes resting.
S01E04,JERRY,Who goes to the hospital to rest?
S01E04,GEORGE,"What are you, a doctor?"
S01E04,JERRY,"Okay, fine, fine. When are you going down there?"
S01E04,GEORGE,Today. Im going today. Just dont do anything until you hear from me.
S01E04,JERRY,All right.
S01E04,GEORGE,"(to the woman) Boy, I have to get to a bathroom."
S01E04,DRY CLEANER,(to Jerry) May I help you?
S01E04,JERRY,Yeah. I picked up this shirt here yesterday. Its completely shrunk. Theres absolutely no way I can wear it.
S01E04,DRY CLEANER,When did you bring it in?
S01E04,JERRY,Whats the difference? Look at it! Do you see the size of this shirt?!
S01E04,DRY CLEANER,You got a receipt?
S01E04,JERRY,I cant find the receipt.
S01E04,DRY CLEANER,You should get the receipt.
S01E04,JERRY,"Look, forget about the receipt, all right? Even if I had the receipt- look at it! Its a hand puppet. What am I gonna do with this?!"
S01E04,DRY CLEANER,"Yes, but how do I know we did the shirt?"
S01E04,JERRY,"What do you think this is a little scam I have? I take this tiny shirt all over the city conning dry cleaners out of money? In fact, forget the money. I dont even want the money. I just once, I would like to hear a dry cleaner admit that something was their fault. Thats what I want. I want an admission of guilt."
S01E04,DRY CLEANER,Maybe you asked for it to be washed.
S01E04,JERRY,No! Dry-cleaned.
S01E04,DRY CLEANE,"Let me explain to you something, okay? With certain types of fabrics, different chemicals can react, causing-"
S01E04,JERRY,You shrunk it! You know you shrunk it! Just tell me that you shrunk it!
S01E04,DRY CLEANER,(looks around making sure not too many people are listening) I shrunk it.
S01E04,JERRY,"I think the only reason we go to the dry cleaner is so I can say to the dry cleaner, Well, its ruined. And of course, the dry cleaner can respond, Its not our fault. Were not responsible. We just ruin the clothes. That ends our legal obligation. You see, the whole problem with dry cleaning is that we all believe that this is actually possible. Th-Right? Theyre cleaning our clothes, but theyre not getting anything wet. Its all dry. I know theres gotta be some liquids back there, some fluids that theyre using. Theres no such thing as dry cleaning. When you get something on your shirt, ever get something on your shirt and try to get it off like that (Jerry brushes off his shirt.) Thats dry cleaning. I dont think thats what theyre doing back there. They dont have eighty guys going, Come on, hurry up! Theres a lot of shirts today!"
S01E04,JERRY,Bless you.
S01E04,ELAINE,"Thank you. What evidence is there that cats are so smart, anyway? Huh? What do they do? Because theyre clean? I am sorry. My Uncle Pete showers four times a day and he cant count to ten, so dont give me hygiene."
S01E04,JERRY ,So what are you gonna do?
S01E04,ELAINE,"I dont know. I cant think of any solution, unless of course they should meet with some unfortunate accident. What do you think a hit man would charge to rub out a couple of cats?"
S01E04,JERRY,"Well, it couldnt be too expensive. Thirteen, fourteen bucks a cat?"
S01E04,ELAINE,"What do you think, Jerry? You wanna make twenty-eight bucks?"
S01E04,JERRY,Im no cat killer.
S01E04,ELAINE,How about we go over there right now and we shave them?
S01E04,JERRY,"Id really like to go, Elaine. But, George is coming back from the hospital. I gotta wait for him. But otherwise I would definitely go."
S01E04,ELAINE,He actually went to the hospital?
S01E04,JERRY,Yeah.
S01E04,ELAINE,"Oh man, hes nuts."
S01E04,JERRY,"Yeah, hes nuts. You wanta bump off a couple of cats. (Enter Kramer, holding a paper up to Jerry.) I know, I know. Its down again."
S01E04,KRAMER,How much are you down altogether?
S01E04,JERRY,I dont know.. fifteen hundred dollars.
S01E04,KRAMER,Wow.
S01E04,JERRY,"You dont have to say Wow. I know its Wow. (Kramer smiling) And theres that smile again. Well, what is that? (Intercom buzzes.) Its George."
S01E04,KRAMER,"Oh, look at this one by the bus stop. Jerry, come here. Take a look at this."
S01E04,JERRY,I really dont need to look.
S01E04,KRAMER,What a body. Yeeaahh. Thats for me.
S01E04,JERRY,"Yeah, and youre just what shes looking for too  a stranger leering through a pair of binoculars ten floors up."
S01E04,KRAMER,Im gonna go down there and try and talk to her.
S01E04,JERRY,What? What? Did you go down there? (George nods.) Did he tell you whats gonna happen? (George shakes his head.) How long were you there?
S01E04,GEORGE,Fifteen seconds.
S01E04,JERRY,You told him you knew Simons?
S01E04,GEORGE,"Yeah, I mentioned Simons. Next thing I know, Im in the parking lot. Perhaps they had some sort of a falling out. Ill tell you one thing. I dont know what hes got. But for a sick guy, hes very strong."
S01E04,JERRY,"Well, thats it. Look, Im going to Vermont. I dont want to think about this. Im selling."
S01E04,ELAINE,"Didnt work, huh?"
S01E04,GEORGE,(laughs) Not quite.
S01E04,ELAINE,"We-Well, what are you gonna do about the stock?"
S01E04,GEORGE,Im keeping it. Im going down with the ship.
S01E04,JERRY,So I know this guy. Im getting all my sneakers at a discount now.
S01E04,VANESSA,I know. You mentioned it.
S01E04,JERRY,"Oh yeah, right."
S01E04,JERRY,(thinking) Oh God. Get me out of here. What a mistake. What made me think this would work? And Ive still got another day! Ive got nothing left to say. Wait... wait... Got one. (to Vanessa) Thats a nice watch. Do you wind it?
S01E04,VANESSA,"No, its got a little battery."
S01E04,JERRY,"Well, thats good."
S01E04,JERRY,"(thinking) Well, the drive home should be a delight. Im speeding the whole way. Let them throw me in jail. I dont care. (to Vanessa) That's the manager? Do you want me to see if we can get another room?"
S01E04,VANESSA,"No, its okay."
S01E04,JERRY,"So, I guess you dont find the separate faucets for the hot and cold, charming?"
S01E04,VANESSA,Not especially.
S01E04,JERRY,"Well, what do you want to do this afternoon?"
S01E04,VANESSA,What can we do? Its raining.
S01E04,JERRY,We cold play Sorry! We cold play Steal the Old Mans Bundle. (Vanessa not amused; Jerry thinking) Maybe I can get an extension cord and hang myself. (to Vanessa) What kind of perfume is that youre wearing?
S01E04,VANESSA,"Oh, youve never heard of it."
S01E04,JERRY,"No, what? What kind is it?"
S01E04,VANESSA,I cant tell you.
S01E04,JERRY,"(thinking) Yeah, thats normal. (to a man nearby) Excuse me, sir. Could I have a look at that business section?"
S01E04,VANESSA,That stock? I thought you got out of that?
S01E04,JERRY,I did. Im just curious. Its been almost a week. I want to check it out. (He finds the stock.) Six points? (to Vanessa) Its up six points!
S01E04,VANESSA,I told you not to sell.
S01E04,JERRY,You did not tell me not to sell.
S01E04,VANESSA,I said the market fluctuates. Remember?
S01E04,JERRY,"Look, Vanessa, of course the market fluctuates. Everybody knows that. I just got fluctuated out of four thousand dollars!"
S01E04,VANESSA,Thats probably why we're-
S01E04,JERRY,What?
S01E04,VANESSA,Forget it.
S01E04,JERRY,"No, what? Thats probably why.."
S01E04,VANESSA,"Thats probably why were staying here, because you lost money on the stock."
S01E04,JERRY,"(thinking) So, what am I looking at here? Twenty-nine hours to go. Well, at least I got plenty of time to find out the name of that perfume..."
S01E04,GEORGE,"(laughing) Have something else. Cmon, have a little dessert?"
S01E04,JERRY ,"Im good, thanks."
S01E04,GEORGE,"Elaine, get something! Its all taken care of."
S01E04,ELAINE,Im kinda full.
S01E04,GEORGE,So dont finish it.
S01E04,JERRY,"(acidly) Shes full. So, Big Daddy. Im just curious. How much did you clear on your little transaction there, all told?"
S01E04,GEORGE,I dont like to discuss figures.
S01E04,JERRY,How much?
S01E04,GEORGE,"I dont know, what? Eight thousand. Its a Hyundai. Get out of here. I told you not to sell. Simons made money, Wilkinson cleaned up."
S01E04,JERRY,"So, Wilkinsons out of the hospital now?"
S01E04,GEORGE ,No. Youd be surprised. You dont recover that quickly from a nose job.
S01E04,ELAINE,Oh god.
S01E04,JERRY,Is that still from the cats?
S01E04,ELAINE,"No, I just have a cold."
S01E04,JERRY,"So, what ever happened with that?"
S01E04,ELAINE,I gave him an ultimatum.
S01E04,GEORGE,He chose the cats?
S01E04,ELAINE,Theyre very clean animals.
S01E04,JERRY,"I gotta say, thats pretty sad. Losing out to a cat."
S01E04,ELAINE,Almost as bad as losing out to a perfume.
S01E04,GEORGE,"I told you those trips were relationship killers. Too bad you cant get your buddy Superman to fly around the Earth at super speed and reverse time. Youd get all the money back, you could have avoided the whole trip to Vermont..."
S01E04,ELAINE,Superman can go back in time?
S01E04,JERRY,We went over that.
S01E04,GEORGE,"Pst. (moves in close with Elaine and Jerry) Wilkinsons got a bite on a new one. Petramco Corp. Out of, uh Springfield. I think. Theyre about to introduce some sort of a robot butcher."
S01E04,JERRY,A robot butcher?
S01E04,GEORGE,"Shhhhh. If you want to get in, theres very little time. (calling to the waitress) Sweetheart.. (Waitress approaches and tears off a check. George stops her.) No, no, no. That ought to cover it. (He hands her some money; she turns to leave; George stops her.) Just a second. Just a... let me jus-peek... (He looks at the check, then takes some money out of her hand. George urges Jerry and Elaine to eat.) Come on, come on, come on..."
S01E04,JERRY,"Im not an investor. People always tell me, you should have your money working for you. Ive decided Ill do the work. Im gonna let the money relax. You know what I mean? Cause you send your money out there  working for you  a lot of times, it gets fired. You go back there, What happened? I had my money. It was here, it was working for me. Yeah, I remember your money. Showing up late. Taking time off. We had to let him go."
S02E01,JERRY,"Im always in traffic with the lane expert. You know this type of person? Constantly reevaluating their lane choice. Never quite sure, Is this the best lane for me? For my life? Theyre always a little bit ahead of you, Can I get in over there? Could I get in over here? Could I get in there? Yeah, come on over here, pal. Were zoomin over here. This is the secret lane, nobody knows about it. The ultimate, I think the ultimate psychological test of traffic is the total dead stop. Not even rolling. And you look out the window, you can see gum clearly. So we know that in the future traffic will get even worse than that. I mean, what will happen? Will it start moving backwords, I wonder? I mean, is that possible? That someday well be going, (Jerry pretends hes driving in reverse.) Boy, this is some really bad traffic now, boy. This, is really bad. Im gonna try to get off and get back on going the other way."
S02E01,GEORGE,She cant kill me right?
S02E01,JERRY,"No, of course not."
S02E01,GEORGE,People break up all the time.
S02E01,JERRY,Everyday.
S02E01,GEORGE,It just didnt work out. What can I do? I wanted to love her. I tried to love her. I couldnt.
S02E01,JERRY,You tried.
S02E01,GEORGE,"I kept looking at her face. Id go, Cmon, love her. Love her!"
S02E01,JERRY,Did you tell her you loved her?
S02E01,GEORGE,"Oh, I had no choice. She squeezed it out of me! Shed tell me she loved me. All right, at first, I just look at her. Id go, Oh, really? Or uh, Boy, thats, thats something. But, eventually you have to come back with, Well, I love you. You know, you can only hold out for so long."
S02E01,JERRY,Youre a human being.
S02E01,GEORGE,And I didnt even ask her out. She asked me out first. She called me up. What was I supposed to do? Say no? (laughs) I cant do that to someone.
S02E01,JERRY,Youre too nice a guy.
S02E01,GEORGE,"I am. Im a nice guy. And she seduced me! We were in my apartment, Im sitting on the couch, shes on the chair. I get up to go to the bathroom, I come back, shes on the couch. What am I supposed to do? Not do anything? I couldnt do that. I wouldve insulted her."
S02E01,JERRY,Youre flesh and blood.
S02E01,GEORGE,"I had nothing to do wtih any of this! I met all her friends, I didnt want to meet them. I kept trying to avoid it. I knew it would only get me in deeper. But they were everywhere! They kept popping up all over the place. This is Nancy, this is Susan, this is Amy, this is my cousin, this is my brother, this is my father... Its like Im in quicksand."
S02E01,JERRY,I told you when I met her.
S02E01,GEORGE,My back is killing me.
S02E01,JERRY,"You gotta go to my chiropractor, hes the best."
S02E01,GEORGE,"Oh yeah, everybodys guy is the best."
S02E01,JERRY,Im gonna make an appointment for you. Well go together.
S02E01,GEORGE,"Please. They dont do anything. Look, do I have to break up with her in person? Cant I do it over the phone? I-I have no stomach for these things."
S02E01,JERRY,You should just do it like a Band-Aid. One motion! Right off!
S02E01,ELAINE,Hi.
S02E01,JERRY,Hi.
S02E01,ELAINE,"Hey, what are you doing?"
S02E01,GEORGE,Im letting you in.
S02E01,ELAINE,Oh no. No. I dont want to sit in the back. Ill be left out of the conversation.
S02E01,GEORGE,"No, you wont."
S02E01,ELAINE,"Yes, I will, George. Ill have to stick my chin on top of the seat."
S02E01,GEORGE,Okay.
S02E01,ELAINE,Why cant you sit in the middle?
S02E01,GEORGE,"Please, it doesnt look good. Boy, boy, girl."
S02E01,ELAINE,"Youre afraid to sit next to a man. Youre a little homophobic, arent ya?"
S02E01,GEORGE,Is it that obvious?
S02E01,ELAINE,"Hello, Jerry."
S02E01,JERRY,Hello.
S02E01,ELAINE,Did you get a haircut?
S02E01,JERRY,"No, shower. So, where are we eating?"
S02E01,ELAINE,"Tell me if you think this is strange. Theres this guy who lives in my building, who I was introduced to a couple of years ago by a friend. Hes a uh teacher, or something. Anyway, after we met, whenever wed run into each other on the street, or in the lobby, or whatever, we would stop and we would chat a little. Nothing much. Little pleasantries. Hes a nice guy, hes got a family. Then after a while, I noticed there was not more stopping. Just saying hello and continuing on our way. And then the verbal hellos stopped, and we just went into these little sort of nods of recognition. So, fine. I figure, thats where this relationship is finally gonna settle polite nodding. Then one day, he doesnt nod. Like I dont exist?! He went from nods to nothing."
S02E01,GEORGE,"(singing; imitating Tony Bennett) You know, Id go from nods to nothing..."
S02E01,ELAINE,"And now, theres this intense animosity whenever we pass. I mean, its like we really hate each other. Its based on nothing."
S02E01,JERRY,A relationship is an organism. You created this thing and then you starved it so it turned against you. Same thing happened in The Blob.
S02E01,GEORGE,I think you absolutely have to say something to this guy. Confront him.
S02E01,ELAINE,Really?
S02E01,GEORGE,Yes.
S02E01,ELAINE,You would do that?
S02E01,GEORGE,If I was a different person.
S02E01,JERRY,"Hello... Hello. Is Glen there?... Im sorry. Is this 805-555-3234?... Yes, I know I have the wrong number, but I just want to know if I dialed wrong or if..."
S02E01,KRAMER,(to the intercom) Come on up.
S02E01,JERRY,"(to the phone) Oh, its you again. See, now if you had answered me, I wouldnt have had to do this. Now thats two long distance calls I made to you why cant you... (The guy hangs up on Jerry again; to nobody) Why? Why do they just hang up like that? Thank you very much."
S02E01,KRAMER,Taste this.
S02E01,JERRY,"No, I just had a sandwich."
S02E01,KRAMER,"No, taste it. Taste it."
S02E01,JERRY,I dont want cantaloupe now.
S02E01,KRAMER,Youve never had cantaloupe like this before...
S02E01,JERRY,I only eat cantaloupe at certain times...
S02E01,KRAMER,...Jerry. This is great cantaloupe.
S02E01,JERRY,...all right!
S02E01,KRAMER,Uh-huh. Its good?
S02E01,JERRY,Its very good.
S02E01,KRAMER,"Good, huh?"
S02E01,JERRY,Good.
S02E01,KRAMER,I got it at Joes.
S02E01,JERRY,Uh-huh.
S02E01,KRAMER,Forty-nine cents a pound. Thats practically half than what youre paying at the supermarket. I dont know why you dont go to Joes.
S02E01,JERRY,Its too far.
S02E01,KRAMER,Its three blocks further. You can use my shopping cart..
S02E01,JERRY,"Im not pulling a shopping cart. What, am I suppose to wear a kerchief? Put stockings on and roll em down below my knee?"
S02E01,KRAMER,"See, the other thing is, if you dont like anything, he takes it right back."
S02E01,JERRY,I dont return fruit. Fruit is a gamble. I know that going in.
S02E01,GEORGE,Im outta there. I did it! Its over.
S02E01,JERRY,You did it? What happened?
S02E01,GEORGE,I told her. In the kitchen  which was risky cause its near all the knives. I started with the word Listen.
S02E01,JERRY,Uh-huh...
S02E01,GEORGE,"I said, Listen Marlene, and then the next thing I know, Im in the middle of it. And theres this voice inside of me going, Youre doing it! Youre doing it! And then she started to cry, and I weakened a bit. I almost relented, but the voice, Jerry, the voice said, Keep going, keep going. Youre almost out! Its like I was making a prison break, you know, and Im heading for the wall, and I trip and I twist my ankle, and they throw the light on you, you know. So, somehow I get though the crying and I keep running. Then the cursing started. Shes firing at me from the guard tower. Son of a bang! Son of a boom! I get to the top of the wall  the front door. I opened it up, Im one foot away, I took one last look around the penitentiary, and I jumped!"
S02E01,JERRY,"See, its never as bad as you imagine."
S02E01,KRAMER,I liked Marlene. Whats her number?
S02E01,GEORGE,"Uh, no, I, I dont think so."
S02E01,JERRY,(to Kramer) Could you stop that smacking?
S02E01,KRAMER,"George, I want you to taste this cantaloupe."
S02E01,GEORGE,"Oh no, thank you."
S02E01,KRAMER,Its the best cantaloupe I ever had.
S02E01,GEORGE,"No, really. No, no, thanks."
S02E01,KRAMER,"Jerry, tell him how good this cantaloupe is."
S02E01,JERRY,Its very good cantaloupe. (Kramer leaves; to George) So thats it? Youre out?
S02E01,GEORGE,"Except for one small problem. Hah, I left some books in her apartment."
S02E01,JERRY,"So, go get them."
S02E01,GEORGE,"Oh, no no, I cant go back there. Jerry, its so awkward and, you know, it could be dangerous sexually. Something could happen, Id be right back where I started from."
S02E01,JERRY,So forget about the books. Did you read them?
S02E01,GEORGE,"Well, yeah."
S02E01,JERRY,What do you need them for?
S02E01,GEORGE,I dont know. Theyre books.
S02E01,JERRY,What is this obsession people have with books? They put them in their houses like theyre trophies. What do you need it for after you read it?
S02E01,GEORGE,Theyre my books.
S02E01,JERRY,So you want me to get the books? Is that it?
S02E01,MARLENE,"...so, it mustve been ninety-five degrees that night, and everyones just standing around the pool with little drinks in their hands. I was wearing my old jeans and t-shirt. And I dont know, I was just in one of those moods. So I said to myself, Marlene, just do it. And I jumped in. And as Im getting out, I feel all these eyes on me, and I look up and everyone is just staring at me."
S02E01,JERRY,So whatd you do?
S02E01,MARLENE,"Well, nothing. Its no skin off my hide if people like to look. I just didnt see what the big attraction was."
S02E01,JERRY,"Well, I have a general idea what it was. I could take a guess."
S02E01,MARLENE,"Hey, you know, Jerry, just because George and I dont see each other anymore, it doesnt mean we shouldnt stay friends."
S02E01,JERRY,No.
S02E01,MARLENE,Good enough. Im really glad we got that settled.
S02E01,JERRY,I dont know how this happened.
S02E01,GEORGE,"Jerry, its not my fault."
S02E01,JERRY,"No, no. Its not your fault. Books, books, I need my books. Have you re-read those books yet, by the way? You know the great thing? When you read Moby Dick the second time, Ahab and the whale become good friends. You know, its not like Marlenes a bad person or anything, but, my God! I mean, weve had like three lunches and a movie, and she never stops calling. (George nods.) And its these meaningless, purposeless, blather calls. She never asks if Im busy or anything. I just pick up the phone, and shes in the middle of a sentence!"
S02E01,GEORGE,It's standard. Has she left you one of those messages where she uses up the whole machine?
S02E01,JERRY,"(disgusted) Ohh! You know, and sometimes shell go, (imitates Marlene) Hello, Jerry? And Ill go, Oh, hi Marlene. And then its Jerry..."
S02E01,JERRY & GEORGE,I dunno sometimes...
S02E01,GEORGE,What trying to get off the phone?
S02E01,JERRY,"(more disgusted) Ohhhh! You cant! Its impossible! Theres no break in the conversation where you can go, All right then... You know, it just goes on and on and on without a break in the wall. I mean, I gotta put a stop to this."
S02E01,GEORGE,Just do it like a Band-Aid. One motion. Right off! (beat) She is sexy though. Dont you think?
S02E01,JERRY,"Yeah. Yes, she is."
S02E01,RECEPTIONIST,Mr. Costanza?
S02E01,GEORGE,Yeah.
S02E01,RECEPTIONIST,The doctor will see you now.
S02E01,GEORGE,"(to Jerry, sarcastically) Yeah, doctor. Im going to have to wait in that little room all by myself, arent I? (He picks up a crossword puzzle.) I better take this. I hate the little room. (George walks into the hallway that leads to the doctors office.) Oh, hello, Doctor."
S02E01,JERRY,"The waiting room. I hate when they make you wait in the room. Cause it says Waiting Room. Theres no chance of not waiting. Cause they call it the waiting room, theyre gonna use it. Theyve got it. Its all set up for you to wait. And you sit there, you know, and youve got your little magazine. You pretend youre reading it, but youre really looking at the other people. You know, youre thinking about about them. Things like, I wonder what hes got. As soon as she goes, Im getting her magazine. And then, they finally call you and its a very exciting moment. They finally call you, and you stand up and you kinda look around at the other people in the room. Well, I guess Ive been chosen. Ill see you all later. You know, so you think youre going to see the doctor, but youre not, are you? No. Youre going into the next waiting room  the littler waiting room. But if they are, you know, doing some sort of medical thing to you, you want to be in the smallest room that they have, I think. You dont wnat to be in the largest room that they have. You know what I mean? You ever see these operating theaters, that they have, with like, stadium seating? You dont want them doing anything to you that makes other doctors go, I have to see this! Are you kidding? Are they really gonna do that to him? Are there seats? Can we get in? Do they scalp tickets to these things? I got two for the Winslow tumor, I got two..."
S02E01,JERRY,"So, how was it?"
S02E01,GEORGE,"I was in there for two minutes. He didnt do anything. Touch this, feel that  seventy-five bucks!"
S02E01,JERRY,"Well, its a first visit."
S02E01,GEORGE,"Whats seventy-five bucks?! What, am I seeing Sinatra in there?! Am I being entertained? I dont understand this. Im only paying half."
S02E01,JERRY,You cant do that.
S02E01,GEORGE,Why not?
S02E01,JERRY,Hes a doctor. You gotta pay what he says.
S02E01,GEORGE,"Oh, no no no. I pay what I say."
S02E01,MARLENE,Are you feeling weird?
S02E01,JERRY,"No, Im fine."
S02E01,MARLENE,Nothing really happened.
S02E01,JERRY,"Yeah, I know."
S02E01,MARLENE,We just kissed a little. People kiss.
S02E01,JERRY,Yeah.
S02E01,MARLENE,Well... night.
S02E01,JERRY,(belated) Good night.
S02E01,KRAMER,Hey.
S02E01,JERRY,Hey.
S02E01,KRAMER,"I got it! This time, I got it!"
S02E01,JERRY ,All right.
S02E01,KRAMER,"Hips! See, its all hips."
S02E01,JERRY,Uh-huh.
S02E01,KRAMER,You gotta come through with the hips first.
S02E01,JERRY,That is out there.
S02E01,KRAMER,Joes?
S02E01,JERRY,"No, supermarket."
S02E01,KRAMER,"Well, is it good?"
S02E01,JERRY,Its uh okay.
S02E01,KRAMER,Let me taste it.
S02E01,KRAMER,"See, that stinks. You cant eat that. You should take that back."
S02E01,JERRY,Im not taking it back.
S02E01,KRAMER,"All right, Ill take it back. Im going by there."
S02E01,JERRY,I dont care about it.
S02E01,KRAMER,"Jerry, you should care. Cantaloupe like this should be taken out of circulation."
S02E01,JERRY,All right. Take it back.
S02E01,JERRYS MESSAGE,"Leave a message, Ill call you back."
S02E01,MARLENE,"(from the phone) Jerry, have you ever taken a bath in the dark? If Im not talking into the soap right now, call me back."
S02E01,KRAMER,Well?
S02E01,JERRY,Marlene.
S02E01,KRAMER,"(smiles) Oh. Oh, Marlene..."
S02E01,JERRY,"Yeah, I took her home one night  we kinda started up a little bit in the car."
S02E01,KRAMER,I thought you were trying to get rid of her?
S02E01,JERRY,"I was. But, shes got me, like, hypnotized."
S02E01,KRAMER,Does George know?
S02E01,JERRY,"No, hed go nuts."
S02E01,KRAMER,"Yeah, no kidding."
S02E01,JERRY,"I feel terrible. (Kramer smiling) I mean, Ive seen her a couple of times since then, and I know I cant go any further, but... Shes just got this like, psychosexual hold over me. I just want her, I cant breathe. Its like a drug."
S02E01,KRAMER,"Whoa, psychosexual."
S02E01,JERRY,I dont know how Im going to tell him.
S02E01,KRAMER,"Man, I dont understand people. I mean, why would George want to deprive you of pleasure? Is it just me?"
S02E01,JERRY,"Its partially you, yeah."
S02E01,KRAMER,Youre his friend. Better that she should sleep with someone else? Some jerk that he doesnt even know?
S02E01,JERRY,"Well, he cant kill me, right?"
S02E01,KRAMER,Youre a human being.
S02E01,JERRY,"I mean, she called me. I havent called her. She started it."
S02E01,KRAMER,Youre flesh and blood.
S02E01,JERRY,Im a nice guy.
S02E01,ELAINE,Hi.
S02E01,JERRY,"(excited) Oh, my little airplane lamp."
S02E01,ELAINE,"You know, you have the slowest elevator in the entire city. Thats hard to get used to when youre in so many other fast ones."
S02E01,JERRY,"Well, the apartment elevators are always slower than the offices, because you dont have to be home on time."
S02E01,ELAINE,Unless youre married to a dictator.
S02E01,JERRY,Yeah... Because they would be very demanding people.
S02E01,ELAINE,Right. Exactly. So I imagine at some point somebodys going to offer me some cantaloupe?
S02E01,KRAMER,Nope. No good.
S02E01,JERRY,"Well, you know what they say. Lucky in love, Unlucky with fruit."
S02E01,KRAMER,"Well, Im taking this back."
S02E01,ELAINE,"So, I had what you might call a little encounter this morning."
S02E01,JERRY,Really? That guy who stopped saying hello?
S02E01,ELAINE,Yes.
S02E01,JERRY,You talked to him?
S02E01,ELAINE,"Yes. I spotted him getting his mail. And at first, I was just going to walk on by, but then I thought, No no no. No. Do not be afraid of this man."
S02E01,JERRY,Right.
S02E01,ELAINE,"So, I walked up behind him and I tapped him on the shoulder. And I said, Hi, remember me? And he furrows his brow, as if hes really trying to figure it out. So I said to him, I said, You little phony. You know exactly who I am."
S02E01,JERRY,"You said ""you little phony""?"
S02E01,ELAINE,"I did. I most certainly did. And he said, he goes, Oh, yeah. Youre Jeanettes friend. We did meet once. And I said, Well, how do you go from that to totally ignoring a person when they walk by?"
S02E01,JERRY,This is amazing.
S02E01,ELAINE,"And he says, he says, Look, I just didnt want to say hello anymore, All right? And I said, Fine. Fine. I didnt want to say hello anymore either, but just I wanted you to know that Im aware of it!"
S02E01,JERRY,"You are the Queen of Confrontation. Youre my new hero. In fact, youve inspired me. Im gonna call George about something right now."
S02E01,ELAINE,This cantaloupe stinks.
S02E01,GEORGE,(considers for a second) I dont care.
S02E01,JERRY,Youre kidding.
S02E01,GEORGE,"No, I dont care."
S02E01,JERRY,You mean that?
S02E01,GEORGE,Absolutely.
S02E01,JERRY,You dont care?
S02E01,GEORGE,No.
S02E01,JERRY,How could you not care?
S02E01,GEORGE,I dont know. But I dont. Im actually almost happy to hear it.
S02E01,JERRY,I thought youd be upset.
S02E01,GEORGE,"I guess I should be, but Im not."
S02E01,JERRY,Am I a bad person? Did I do something terrible?
S02E01,GEORGE,Youre a fine person. Youre a humanitarian. Shes very sexy.
S02E01,JERRY,That voice. That voice. Shes driving me crazy.
S02E01,GEORGE,I know. I know.
S02E01,JERRY,"So I can see her tonight, and you dont care?"
S02E01,GEORGE,See her tonight. See her tomorrow. Go. Knock yourself out. Shes too crazy for me.
S02E01,JERRY,All right. As long as youre okay. Because I cant stop thinking about her.
S02E01,GEORGE,Im okay. Im fine. Im wonderful. I never felt better in my whole life.
S02E01,JERRY,Good. And Ill tell you what... You dont have to pay me back the thirty-five I gave to the chiropractor for the rest of your bill.
S02E01,GEORGE,(shocked and angry) You paid that crook?!
S02E01,JERRY,I had to.
S02E01,GEORGE,"He didnt do anything, Jerry. Its a scam! Who told you to do that?"
S02E01,JERRY,It was embarrassing to me.
S02E01,GEORGE,"Oh, I was trying to make a point."
S02E01,JERRY,Why dont you make a point with your own doctor? (George gulps.) Whats wrong?
S02E01,GEORGE,(gasping) I think I swallowed a fly! I swallowed a fly! What do I do? (He turns to a coffee shop patron at the counter.) What can happen?!
S02E01,JERRY,"So, you wanna come up for a few minutes?"
S02E01,MARLENE,"Im sorry, Jerry. I just dont think this is gonna work."
S02E01,JERRY,Really? I thought...
S02E01,MARLENE,"I know, Im sorry."
S02E01,JERRY,"Gee, I just didnt expect it from the way youve been acting."
S02E01,MARLENE,You sure you want to talk about this? Cause I sure dont.
S02E01,JERRY,Of course I want to talk about it.
S02E01,MARLENE,"Well, okay. I guess things changed for me on Tuesday night."
S02E01,JERRY,Tuesday night? What happened Tuesday night?
S02E01,MARLENE,I saw your act.
S02E01,JERRY,My act? Wha-What does that have to do with anything?
S02E01,MARLENE,"Well, to be honest, it just didnt make it for me. Its just so much fluff."
S02E01,JERRY,"I cant believe this. So what are you saying? You didnt like my act, so thats it?"
S02E01,MARLENE,I cant be with someone if I dont respect what they do.
S02E01,JERRY,Youre a cashier!
S02E01,MARLENE,"Look, Jerry, its just wasn't my kind of humor."
S02E01,JERRY,You cant go by the audience that night. It was late. They were terrible.
S02E01,MARLENE,I heard the material.
S02E01,JERRY,I have other stuff. Y-You should come see me on the weekend.
S02E01,JERRY,"Women need to like the job of the guy theyre with. If they dont like the job, they dont like the guy. Men know this. Which is why we make up the phony, bogus names for the jobs that we have. Well, right now, Im the regional management supervisor. Im in development, research, consulting... Men on the other hand  if they are physically attracted to a woman  are not that concerned with her job. Are we? Men dont really care. Menll just go, Really? Slaughterhouse? Is that where you work? That sounds interesting. So whaddaya got a big cleaver there? Youre just lopping their heads off? That sounds great! Listen, why dont you shower up, and well get some burgers and catch a movie."
S02E02,JERRY,"My parents live in Florida now. They moved there last year. They didnt want to move to Florida, but theyre in their sixties, and thats the law. You know how it works. They got the leisure police. They pull up in front of the old peoples house with a golf cart, jump out, Lets go Pop, white belt, white pants, white shoes, get in the back. Drop the snow shovel right there. Drop it! I am not much for the family gathering. You know, you sit there, and the conversations so boring. Its so dull. And you start to fantasize. You know, you think, What if I just got up and jumped out that window? What would it be like? Just crashed right through the glass. You know. Come back in, theres broken glass, everybodys all upset. No, Im all right. I was just a little bored there. And uh no, Im fine. I came back. I wanted to hear a little more about that Hummel collection, Aunt Rose. Lets pick it up right there."
S02E02,HELEN,"You have so many nice jackets. I dont know why you had to bring this jacket. Who wears a jacket like this? Whats wrong with that nice gray one? You have beautiful clothes. They sit in your closet. Morty, you cant wear this!"
S02E02,MORTY,Are you getting that?
S02E02,HELEN,I thought you were getting it.
S02E02,MORTY,Should I pick up?
S02E02,HELEN,You want me to get that?
S02E02,MORTY,Ill get it!
S02E02,HELEN,Ill get it!
S02E02,HELEN,Hello?... Hello?
S02E02,JERRY,Hi.
S02E02,HELEN,Hi.
S02E02,JERRY,(to Morty) Would you make this thing lower! I can hear it on the street!
S02E02,MORTY,"So, howd you do?"
S02E02,JERRY,We won. I made an incredible play in the field! There was a tag-up at third base and I threw the guy out from left field on a fly! Well be in the championship game Wednesday because of me. It was the single greatest moment in my life.
S02E02,HELEN,This is your greatest moment? A game?
S02E02,JERRY,"Well, no. Sharon Besser, of course."
S02E02,MORTY,"You know what my greatest moment was, dont you? Nineteen-forty-six. I went to work for Harry Flemming and I came up with the idea for the beltless trenchcoat."
S02E02,HELEN,"Jerry, look at this sport jacket. Is this a jacket to wear to an anniversary party?"
S02E02,JERRY,"Well, the mans an individualist  he worked for Harry Flemming. He knows what hes doing."
S02E02,HELEN,But its their 50th anniversary.
S02E02,MORTY,Your mother doesn't like my taste in clothing.
S02E02,HELEN,"You know, I spoke to Manya and Isaac on the phone today. They invited you again. I think you should go."
S02E02,JERRY,"First of all, I made plans with Elaine."
S02E02,HELEN,So bring her.
S02E02,JERRY,"I dont even know them. What is she, your second cousin? I mean, Ive met them three times in my life."
S02E02,MORTY,"I dont know her either. (gesturing to Helen) She makes me fly all the way from Florida for this, and then she criticizes my jacket."
S02E02,HELEN,"At least come and say hello, have a cup of coffee, then youll leave."
S02E02,MORTY,How come he gets to leave?
S02E02,JERRY,"If I wind up sitting next to Uncle Leo, I am leaving. Hes always grabbing my arm when he talks to me. I guess its because so many people have left in the middle of his conversation."
S02E02,MORTY,"And its always about Jeffrey, right?"
S02E02,JERRY,Yeah. He talks about him like he split the atom. The kid works for the Parks Department.
S02E02,KRAMER,"Morty, are you coming in?"
S02E02,MORTY,"Oh, yeah. I forgot all about it."
S02E02,KRAMER,"(to Jerry) Hey, howd you do?"
S02E02,JERRY,We won. Were in the finals on Wednesday.
S02E02,KRAMER,Yeah!
S02E02,JERRY,(to Kramer and Morty) What is this about?
S02E02,KRAMER,Im completely changing the configuration of the apartment. Youre not gonna believe it when you see it. A whole new lifestyle.
S02E02,JERRY,What are you doing?
S02E02,KRAMER,Levels.
S02E02,JERRY,Levels?
S02E02,KRAMER,"Yeah, Im getting rid of all my furniture. All of it. And Im going to build these different levels, with steps, and itll all be carpeted with a lot of pillows. You know, like ancient Egypt."
S02E02,JERRY,You drew up plans for this?
S02E02,KRAMER,No no. Its all in my head.
S02E02,MORTY,I dont know how youre going to be comfortable like that.
S02E02,KRAMER,"Oh, Ill be comfortable."
S02E02,JERRY,When do you intend to do this?
S02E02,KRAMER,Ohh... should be done by the end of the month.
S02E02,JERRY,Youre doing this yourself?
S02E02,KRAMER,"Its a simple job. Why, you dont think I can?"
S02E02,JERRY,"Oh, no. Its not that I dont think you can. I know that you cant, and Im positive that you wont."
S02E02,KRAMER,"Well, I got the tools. I got the pillows. All I need is the lumber."
S02E02,MORTY,"Hey, thats some big job."
S02E02,JERRY,"I, dont see it happening."
S02E02,KRAMER,"Well, this time, this time youre wrong. Cmon. Ill even bet you."
S02E02,JERRY,Seriously?
S02E02,HELEN,"I dont want you betting. Morty, dont let him bet."
S02E02,KRAMER,A big dinner with dessert. But Ive got till the end of the month.
S02E02,JERRY,Ill give you a year.
S02E02,KRAMER,No no no. End of the month.
S02E02,JERRY,Its a bet.
S02E02,JERRY,"(to Elaine) Seriously, do you wanna switch chairs?"
S02E02,ELAINE,"No, no. Im fine."
S02E02,UNCLE LEO,"Jerry, are you listening to this?"
S02E02,JERRY,"Yeah, Uncle Leo."
S02E02,UNCLE LEO,"So, so, now the parks commissioner is recommending Jeffrey for a citation."
S02E02,JERRY,Right. For the reducing of the pond scum?
S02E02,UNCLE LEO,"No, for the walking tours."
S02E02,JERRY,"Oh, yeah. Where the people eat the plant life. The edible foliage tour."
S02E02,UNCLE LEO,"Thats exactly right. He knows the whole history of the park. For two hours hes talking and answering questions. But you want to know something? Whenever he has a problem with one of these high-powered big shots in the Parks Department, you know who he calls?"
S02E02,JERRY,Mickey Mantle?
S02E02,ELAINE,"(saving Jerry from Leo) Jerry, Jerry. Did you taste these peas? (to Manya) These peas are great!"
S02E02,JERRY,(eating a forkful) These peas are bursting with country fresh flavor.
S02E02,ELAINE,Mmm... phenomenal peas.
S02E02,MORTY,Are you ready for dessert?
S02E02,JERRY,"Well, actually, we do have to kind of get going."
S02E02,MANYA,(surprised) Youre going?
S02E02,ELAINE,"Oh uh, I dont really eat dessert. Im dieting."
S02E02,JERRY,"Yeah, I cant eat dessert either. The sugar makes my ankles swell up, and I cant dance."
S02E02,MANYA ,Cant dance?
S02E02,HELEN,"Hes kidding, Manya."
S02E02,MANYA,Is that a joke?
S02E02,HELEN,"So, did you hear Claires getting married?"
S02E02,MANYA,"Yeah, yeah.."
S02E02,HELEN,"I hear the fella owns a couple of racehorses. You know, trotters, like at Yonkers."
S02E02,JERRY,Horses? Theyre like big riding dogs.
S02E02,ELAINE,What about ponies? What kind of abnormal animal is that? And those kids who had their own ponies...
S02E02,JERRY,"I know, I hated those kids. In fact, I hate anyone that ever had a pony when they were growing up."
S02E02,MANYA,(angry) I had a pony.
S02E02,JERRY,"Well, I didnt uh really mean a pony, per se..."
S02E02,MANYA,"When I was a little girl in Poland, we all had ponies. My sister had pony, my cousin had pony... So, whats wrong with that?"
S02E02,JERRY,Nothing. Nothing at all. I was just merely expressing...
S02E02,HELEN,Should we have coffee? Whos having coffee?
S02E02,MANYA,He was a beautiful pony! And I loved him.
S02E02,JERRY,"Well, Im sure you did. Who wouldnt love a pony? Who wouldnt love a person that had a pony?"
S02E02,MANYA,You! You said so!
S02E02,JERRY,"No, see, we didnt have ponies. Im sure at that time in Poland, they were very common. They were probably like compact cars.."
S02E02,MANYA,Thats it! I had enough!
S02E02,ISAAC,"Have your coffee, everybody. Shes a little upset. Its been an emotional day."
S02E02,JERRY,"I didnt know she had a pony. How was I to know she had a pony? Who figures an immigrants going to have a pony? Do you know what the odds are on that? I mean, in all the pictures I saw of immigrants on boats coming into New York harbor, I never saw one of them sittin on a pony. Why would anybody come here if they had a pony? Who leaves a country packed with ponies to come to a non-pony country? It doesnt make sense. Am I wrong?"
S02E02,JERRY,Ill drive you to the airport.
S02E02,HELEN,"No, were taking a cab."
S02E02,JERRY,I just hope that whole pony incident didnt put a damper on the trip.
S02E02,HELEN,Dont be ridiculous. It was a misunderstanding.
S02E02,MORTY,"Hey, I agree with him. Nobody likes a kid with a pony."
S02E02,JERRY,"Well, if you ever talk to her, tell her Im sorry. Elaine too. She feels terrible."
S02E02,HELEN,"You know, you should give Manya a call."
S02E02,JERRY,Maybe I will.
S02E02,KRAMER,"Oh, hi. I uh just came to say goodbye."
S02E02,KRAMER,Need any help with those?
S02E02,MORTY,"Its nothing. I got it. So, how are your levels coming along?"
S02E02,KRAMER,"Oh, well... I decided Im not gonna do it."
S02E02,JERRY,(laughing) Really? What a shock.
S02E02,HELEN,"Goodbye, Jerry."
S02E02,JERRY,Take care.
S02E02,HELEN,Well call you.
S02E02,MORTY,"Bye, Jer."
S02E02,JERRY,"Bye, Dad. Take it easy."
S02E02,MORTY,"Bye, Mr. Kramer."
S02E02,KRAMER,"Yeah. So long, Morty."
S02E02,JERRY,"So, when do I get my dinner?"
S02E02,KRAMER,Theres no dinner. The bets off. Im not gonna do it.
S02E02,JERRY,"Yes, I know youre not gonna do it. Thats why I bet."
S02E02,KRAMER,"Ya well, theres no bet if Im not doing it."
S02E02,JERRY,Thats the bet! That youre not doing it!
S02E02,KRAMER,"Yeah, well, I could do it. I dont wanna do it."
S02E02,JERRY,We didnt bet on if you wanted to. We bet on if it would be done.
S02E02,KRAMER,And it could be done.
S02E02,JERRY,"Well, of course it could be done! Anything could be done! But it only is done if its done! Show me the levels! The bet is the levels!"
S02E02,KRAMER,I dont want the levels!
S02E02,JERRY,"Thats the bet! (The phone rings; Jerry answers it.) Hello?... No- oh, hi... (Kramer leaves) no, they just left... Oh, my God... hang on a second. Maybe I can still catch em. (Jerry goes over to the window and opens it; calling out the window) Ma! Ma! Up here! Dont get in the cab! Manya died! Manya died!!"
S02E02,HELEN,Who did you talk to?
S02E02,JERRY,Uncle Leo.
S02E02,HELEN,And whens the funeral?
S02E02,JERRY,I dont know. He said hed call back.
S02E02,MORTY,"You know what this means, dont you? We lost the Supersaver. Those tickets are non-refundable."
S02E02,HELEN,She just had a check-up. The doctor said she was fine. Unless...
S02E02,JERRY,What?
S02E02,HELEN,What? Nothing.
S02E02,JERRY,You dont think... What? The pony remark?
S02E02,HELEN,"Oh, dont be ridiculous. She was an old woman."
S02E02,JERRY,You dont think that I killed her?
S02E02,MORTY,You know what the flight backll cost us?
S02E02,JERRY,It was just an innocent comment! I didnt know she had a pony!
S02E02,MORTY,"Maybe we can get an army transport flight. They got a base in Sarasota, I think."
S02E02,JERRY,The whole thing was taking out of context. It was a joke. (The phone rings.) Thats probably Uncle Leo.
S02E02,HELEN,"Hello?... Yes, I know... Well, its just one of those things... Sure, sure, well see you then."
S02E02,HELEN,The funerals Wednesday.
S02E02,JERRY,"Wednesday? What, what Wednesday?"
S02E02,HELEN,"Two o clock, Wednesday."
S02E02,JERRY,Ah
S02E02,HELEN,What?
S02E02,JERRY,Ive got the softball game on Wednesday. Its the championship.
S02E02,HELEN,So? Youre not obligated. Go play in your game.
S02E02,JERRY,I didnt even know the woman.
S02E02,HELEN,So dont go.
S02E02,JERRY,I mean I met her three times. I dont even know her last name.
S02E02,HELEN,"Jerry, no ones forcing you."
S02E02,JERRY,"I mean, who has a funeral on a Wednesday? Thats what I want to know. I mean, its the championship, Im hitting everything."
S02E02,HELEN,I dont have a dress to wear. (to Morty) And you. You dont have anything.
S02E02,MORTY,I got my sport jacket.
S02E02,HELEN,Youre not wearing that to a funeral.
S02E02,MORTY,Whats wrong with it?
S02E02,HELEN,It looks ridiculous.
S02E02,MORTY,What? Im gonna buy a new sport jacket now?
S02E02,JERRY,I dont know what to do.
S02E02,MORTY,(depressed) You know what this funerals gonna wind up costing me? Oh boy!
S02E02,JERRY,"We dont understand death. And the proof of this is that we give dead people a pillow. And, uh, I mean, hey, you know. I think if you cant stretch out and get some solid rest at that point, I dont see how bedding accessories really make the difference. I mean, they got the guy in a suit with a pillow. Now, is he going to a meeting, or is he catching forty winks? I mean, lets make up our mind where we think theyre going."
S02E02,ELAINE,I actually like ponies. I was just trying to make conversation. What times your game?
S02E02,JERRY,Two Forty-Five.
S02E02,ELAINE,And what times the funeral?
S02E02,JERRY,Two o clock.
S02E02,ELAINE,How long does a funeral take?
S02E02,JERRY,"Depends on how nice the person was. But you gotta figure, even Oswald took forty-five minutes."
S02E02,ELAINE,So you cant do both?
S02E02,JERRY,"You know, if the situation were reversed and Manya had some mah-jongg championship or something, I wouldnt expect her to go to my funeral. I would understand."
S02E02,ELAINE,How can you even consider not going?
S02E02,GEORGE,"You know, Ive been thinking. I cannot envision any circumstances in which Ill ever have the opportunity to have sex again. Hows it gonna happen? I just dont see how it could occur."
S02E02,ELAINE,"You know, funerals always make me think about my own mortality and how Im actually gonna die someday. Me, dead. Imagine that."
S02E02,GEORGE,"They always make me take stock of my life. And how Ive pretty much wasted all of it, and how I plan to continue wasting it."
S02E02,JERRY,"I know, and then you say to yourself, From this moment on, Im not gonna waste any more of it. But then you go, How? What can I do thats not wasting it?"
S02E02,ELAINE,Is this a waste of time? What should we be doing? Cant you have coffee with people?
S02E02,GEORGE,"You know, I cant believe youre even considering not playing. We need you. Youre hitting everything."
S02E02,ELAINE,He has to go. He may have killed her.
S02E02,JERRY,Me? What about you? You brought up the pony.
S02E02,ELAINE,"Oh, yeah, but I didnt say I hated anyone who had one."
S02E02,GEORGE,(to Jerry) Whos going to play left field?
S02E02,JERRY,Bender.
S02E02,GEORGE,"Bender? He cant play left. He stinks. I just dont see what purpose is it gonna serve your going? I mean, you think dead peole care whos at their funeral? They dont even know theyre having a funeral. Its not like shes hanging out in the back going, I cant believe Jerry didnt show up."
S02E02,ELAINE,Maybe shes there in spirit. How about that?
S02E02,GEORGE,"If youre a spirit, and you can travel to other dimensions and galaxies, and find out the mysteries of the universe, you think shes gonna wanna hang around Drexlers funeral home on Ocean Parkway?"
S02E02,ELAINE,"George, I met this woman. She is not traveling to any other dimensions."
S02E02,GEORGE,You know how easy it is for dead people to travel? Its not like getting on a bus. One second. (snaps his fingers) Its all mental.
S02E02,JERRY,Fifty years they were married. Now hes moving to Pheonix.
S02E02,ELAINE,Phoenix? Whats happening with his appartment?
S02E02,JERRY,"I dont know. Theyve been in there since, like, World War II. The rents three hundred a month."
S02E02,ELAINE,"Three hundred a month? Oh, my God."
S02E02,EULOGIST,"Although this may seem like a sad event, it should not be a day of mourning. For Manya had a rich, fulfilling life. She grew up in a different world  a simpler world  with loving parents, a beautiful home in the country, and from what I understand, she eve had a pony. (Jerry throws up his hands.) Oh, how she loved that pony. Even in her declining years, whenever she would speak of it, her eyes would light up. Its lustrous coat, its flowing mane. It was the pride of Krakow."
S02E02,JERRY,"Well, the games starting just about now."
S02E02,HELEN,It was good that the two of you came. It was a nice gesture.
S02E02,NEPHEW,"Im not a doctor yet, Uncle Morty. Im just an intern. I cant write a note to an airline."
S02E02,MORTY,Youve got your degree. They dont care. They just want to see something.
S02E02,JERRY,I just wanted to say how sorry I was...
S02E02,UNCLE LEO,"Jerry, you wanna hear something? Your cousin, Jeffrey, is switching parks. Theyre transferring him to Riverside - so hell completely revamp that operation, you understand?"
S02E02,JERRY,Yeah.
S02E02,UNCLE LEO,"Hell do in Riverside what he did in Central Park. More money. So, thats your cousin."
S02E02,MORTY,"You dont understand, Ive never paid a full fare."
S02E02,JERRY,"Once again, I just want to say how sorry I am about the other night."
S02E02,ELAINE,"Oh, me too."
S02E02,ISAAC,"Oh, no no no. She forgot all about that. She was much more upset about the potato salad."
S02E02,ELAINE,"So, I understand youre moving to Phoenix?"
S02E02,ISAAC,"Yeah, my brother lives there. I think Manya wouldve liked Phoenix."
S02E02,ELAINE,"Mmm, gorgeous, exquisite town. So, whats happening with your apartment?"
S02E02,ISAAC,Of course its very hot there. Ill have to get uh air conditioner.
S02E02,ELAINE,"Oh, you can have mine. Ill ship it out to you. (Isaac isn't listening to Elaine) But what about that big apartment on West End Avenue?"
S02E02,ISAAC,Although they say its a dry heat.
S02E02,ELAINE,"Dry, wet... (trying to get through to him) whats happening with your apartment?"
S02E02,ISAAC,I dont even know if I should take my winter clothing.
S02E02,ELAINE,"I have an idea. Leave the winter clothing in the apartment, and Ill watch it for you and Ill live there and Ill make sure that nothing happens to it."
S02E02,ISAAC,"Oh, the apartment. Jeffreys taking the apartment."
S02E02,ELAINE,"Oh, Jeffrey."
S02E02,JERRY,You know Jeffery?
S02E02,ELAINE ,"Yeah, from what I understand, he works for the Parks Department."
S02E02,HELEN,Its raining.
S02E02,JERRY,Its raining? Its raining. The game will be postponed. Well play tomorrow.
S02E02,MORTY,"Believe me, I wouldnt bother you if the army hadnt closed that base in Sarasota. Here, scribble a little something here."
S02E02,NEPHEW,I cant. Ill get in trouble.
S02E02,MORTY,"Oh, for Gods sake!"
S02E02,GEORGE,Who gets picked off in softball? Its unheard of.
S02E02,JERRY,Its never happened to me before.
S02E02,ELAINE,"I remember saying to myself, Why is Jerry so far off the base?"
S02E02,JERRY,Ill have to live with this shame for the rest of my life.
S02E02,GEORGE,"And then in the fifth inning, why did you take off on the pop fly?"
S02E02,JERRY,I thought there were two outs.
S02E02,ELAINE,I couldnt believe it when I saw you running. (laughing) I thought maybe they had changed the rules or something.
S02E02,JERRY ,It was the single worst moment of my life.
S02E02,GEORGE,(smiling) What about Sharon Besser?
S02E02,JERRY,"Oh, well, of course. Nineteen-seventy-three."
S02E02,ELAINE,"Makes you wonder, though, doesnt it?"
S02E02,JERRY,Wonder about what?
S02E02,ELAINE,You know... (looking up) the spirit world.
S02E02,JERRY,You think Manya showed up during the game and put a hex on me?
S02E02,ELAINE,I never saw anyone play like that.
S02E02,JERRY,But I went to the funeral.
S02E02,ELAINE,"Yeah, but that doesnt make up for killin her."
S02E02,GEORGE,Maybe Manya missed the funeral because she was off visiting another galaxy that day.
S02E02,JERRY,Dont you think she woulda heard I was there?
S02E02,GEORGE,Not necessarily.
S02E02,JERRY,Who figures and immigrants gonna have a pony?
S02E02,JERRY,"What is the pony? What is the point of the pony? Why do we have these animals, these ponies? What do we do with them? Besides the pony ride. Why ponies? What are we doing with them? I mean, police dont use them for, you know, crowd control. (Jerry crouches down, and makes like hes riding a pony.) Hey, uh, you wanna get back behind the barricades. Hey! Hey, little boy. Yeah, Im talking to you. Behind the barricades! So somebody, I assume, genetically engineered these ponies. Do you think they could make them any size? I mean, could they make them like the size of a quarter, if they wanted? That would be fun for Monopoly, though, wouldnt it? Just have a little pony and you put him on the... Baltic, thats two down, go ahead. Hold it. Right there. Baltic. Yeah, thats it. Fine. Right there, hold it right there."
S02E03,JERRY,"I hate clothes, okay? I hate buying them. I hate picking them out of my closet. I cant stand every day trying to come up with little outfits for myself. I think eventually fashion wont even exist. It wont. I think eventually well all be wearing the same thing. Cause anytime I see a movie or a TV show where theres people from the future or another planet, theyre all wearing the same thing. Somehow they decided, This is going to be our outfit. One-piece silver jumpsuit, V-stripe, and boots. Thats it. We should come up for an outfit for Earth. An Earth outfit. We should vote on it. Candidates propose different outfits. No speeches. They walk out, twirl, walk off. We just sit in the audience and go, That was nice. I could wear that."
S02E03,JERRY ,I think Ive seen enough.
S02E03,SALESMAN,"Well, I might have something in the back."
S02E03,ELAINE,"The back? They never find anything in the back. If they had anything good in the back, theyd put it out in the front."
S02E03,JERRY,"Why dont they open up an entire store for the back? Call it, Just Back. All back; No front. You walk in the front, youre immediately in the back. (Jerry picks up a tie display, and shakes it rhythmically from left to right.) Look, Elaine, tie carwash."
S02E03,CUSTOMER,"Oh, I just read that. Thats terrific."
S02E03,JERRY,(pointing to Elaine) Her father wrote that.
S02E03,CUSTOMER,Alton Benes is your father?
S02E03,ELAINE,Yeah.
S02E03,CUSTOMER,I always felt he deserved a wider audience.
S02E03,ELAINE,Im not so sure he wants one.
S02E03,ELAINE,"Hey, dont forget Sunday, okay? You and George are coming, right? Hotel Westbury, eight oclock."
S02E03,JERRY,I guess Im coming. I mean...
S02E03,ELAINE,"What? What, you dont want to go now?"
S02E03,JERRY,"No, Ill go. Im going."
S02E03,ELAINE,"No, Jerry, you have to. I need a buffer. You know, I havent seen my father in a while and... you know..."
S02E03,JERRY,"Im worried I wont be able to talk to him. Hes such a great writer. Frankly, I prefer the company of nitwits."
S02E03,ELAINE,"So, thats why were not together anymore."
S02E03,JERRY,What is this?
S02E03,JERRY,This is beautiful. These jackets never fit me right.
S02E03,ELAINE,Try it on.
S02E03,ELAINE,"Wow, this is soft suede."
S02E03,JERRY,This may be the most perfect jacket I have ever put on.
S02E03,JERRY,How much is it?
S02E03,ELAINE,(shocked) Oh my God.
S02E03,JERRY,Bad? (Elaine nods.) Very bad?
S02E03,ELAINE,You have no idea.
S02E03,JERRY,I have some idea.
S02E03,ELAINE,No idea.
S02E03,JERRY,Ive got a ballpark.
S02E03,ELAINE,There is no park and the team has relocated.
S02E03,JERRY,Let me see that. (Jerry looks at the tag.) That is high.
S02E03,ELAINE,"Oh man, that is a beautiful jacket, though."
S02E03,JERRY,Whats with the pink lining and the candy stripes?
S02E03,ELAINE,"Well, its just a lining. You can always have it changed."
S02E03,JERRY,"Should I get it? I hate these moments. Im hearing the dual voices now, you know, What about the money? Whats money?"
S02E03,SALESMAN,It looks wonderful on you.
S02E03,JERRY,Hey.
S02E03,KRAMER,Hey. New jacket?
S02E03,JERRY,What do you think?
S02E03,KRAMER,Its beautiful.
S02E03,JERRY,Is it me?
S02E03,KRAMER,Thats definitely you.
S02E03,JERRY,Really?
S02E03,KRAMER,"Thats more you than youve ever been. Hey, what is with the pink lining?"
S02E03,JERRY,I dont know. Its got a pink lining.
S02E03,KRAMER,"Oh... So, what did you pay for this?"
S02E03,JERRY ,I paid what it costs.
S02E03,KRAMER,How much?
S02E03,JERRY,Whats the difference?
S02E03,KRAMER,"What, youre not gonna tell me?"
S02E03,JERRY,Id rather not say it out loud. Its embarrassing.
S02E03,KRAMER,Over three hundred?
S02E03,JERRY,"Yes, but lets just stop it right there."
S02E03,KRAMER,Its over four hundred?
S02E03,JERRY ,"Really, Im not answering anymore."
S02E03,KRAMER,Is it over four hundred?
S02E03,JERRY,Would you?
S02E03,KRAMER,"Woah, Nelson!"
S02E03,JERRY,"I know, I know."
S02E03,KRAMER,What are you gonna do with the leather one?
S02E03,JERRY,I dont know.
S02E03,KRAMER,"Well, are you gonna wear it?"
S02E03,JERRY,Maybe.
S02E03,KRAMER,Youre not going to wear this.
S02E03,JERRY,Do you want it?
S02E03,KRAMER,"Well, yeah. Okay. Ill take it. I like the jacket."
S02E03,JERRY,"Okay, take it."
S02E03,KRAMER,"Heey, good karma for you. (Kramer puts on Jerrys old jacket and stands next to Jerry, looking in the mirror.) Oh baby."
S02E03,GEORGE,(singing) Master of the house/Doling out the charm/Ready with a handshake and an open palm/Tells a saucy talk/Loves to make a stir/Everyone appreciates a...
S02E03,JERRY,What is that song?
S02E03,GEORGE,"Oh, its from Les Miserables. I went to see it last week. I cant get it out of my head. I just keep singing it over and over. It just comes out. I have no control over it. Im singin it on elevators, buses. Im singin it in front of clients. Its taken over my life."
S02E03,JERRY,"You know, Schumann went mad from that."
S02E03,GEORGE,Artie Schuman? From Camp Hatchapee?
S02E03,JERRY,"No, you idiot."
S02E03,GEORGE,"What are you, Bud Abbott? What are you callin me an idiot?"
S02E03,JERRY,You dont know Robert Schumann? The composer?
S02E03,GEORGE,"Oh, Schumann. Of course."
S02E03,JERRY,He went crazy from one note. He couldnt get it out of his head. I think it was an A. He kept repeating it over and over again. He had to be institutionalized.
S02E03,GEORGE,"Really? (Jerry nods his head) Well, what if it doesnt stop? Oh, that I really needed to hear. That helps a lot! All right, just say something. Just start talking. Change the subject. Lets just go, All right? I cant believe were having dinner with Alton Benes."
S02E03,JERRY,"I know exactly whats gonna happen tonight. Im gonna try and act like Im not impressed, hes gonna see right through it."
S02E03,GEORGE,"Yeah, hell be looking at us like hes backstage at a puppet show."
S02E03,JERRY,Let me just get my jacket.
S02E03,GEORGE,(singing)  Master of the house/Keeper of the inn... (Jerry re-enters the living room and modestly models his new jacket for George. George is impressed.) This is huge! When did this happen?
S02E03,JERRY,"Wednesday. This jacket has completely changed my life. When I leave the house in this, its with a whole different confidence. Like tonight, I mightve been a little nervous. But, inside this jacket, I am composed, grounded, secure that I can meet any social challenge."
S02E03,GEORGE,Can I say one thing to you? And I say this with an unblemished record of staunch heterosexuality.
S02E03,JERRY,Absolutely.
S02E03,GEORGE,Its fabulous.
S02E03,JERRY,I know.
S02E03,GEORGE,"And Ill tell you something else, Im not even going to ask you. I want to know. But Im not gonna ask. Youll tell me when you feel comfortable. So what was it? Four hundred? Five hundred? Did you pay five hundred for this? (Jerry coyly ignores Georges questions, while George grows increasingly serious.) Over six? Cant be seven. Dont tell me you paid seven hundred dollars for this jacket! Did you pay seven hundred dollars for this jacket? Is that what youre saying to me? You are sick! Is that what you paid for this jacket? Over seven hundred? What did you pay for this jacket?! I wont say anything. I wanna know what you paid for this jacket! Oh my God! A thousand dollars?! You paid a thousand dollars for this jacket?! All right, fine. (George heads for the door.) Im walking outta here right now thinking you paid a thousand dollars for this jacket, unless you tell me different. (Jerry remains silent.) Oh, ho! All right! Ill tell you what, if you dont say anything in the next five seconds, Ill know it was over a thousand."
S02E03,KRAMER,"(to Jerry) Hey. Hey, would you do me a solid?"
S02E03,JERRY,"Well, what kind of solid?"
S02E03,KRAMER,I need you to sit in the car for two minutes while its double-parked. I gotta pick up some birds.
S02E03,JERRY,Birds?
S02E03,KRAMER,"Yeah. A friend of mine, hes a magician. Hes going away on vacation. He asked me to take care of his doves."
S02E03,JERRY,So take a cab.
S02E03,KRAMER,They wont take a cage full of birds.
S02E03,JERRY,I cant. Im on my way out. Theres no way I can do it.
S02E03,KRAMER,"George, do me a solid? Two minutes."
S02E03,GEORGE,"Well, Im going with him. Id like to... Ive never done a solid before."
S02E03,KRAMER,"All right... Yeah. All right, have a good one."
S02E03,JERRY,"(scoffs) Two minutes. Believe me, I know his two minutes. By his conception of time, his life will last over two thousand years."
S02E03,GEORGE,(singing) Master of the House/Quick to catch your eye/Never wants a passerby to pass him by...
S02E03,JERRY,"Schumann. (George stops himself, frightened. Jerry looks around the lobby.) Where are they?"
S02E03,GEORGE,Maybe he didnt show up.
S02E03,JERRY,"What, you dont want to do this?"
S02E03,GEORGE,"I dont think theres ever been an appointment in my life where I wanted the other guy to show up. (George notices an elderly man in a leather chair.) Wait a second, is that him?"
S02E03,JERRY,"Yeah, I think it is. (They walk toward the man. Jerry hesitates.) Wheres Elaine?"
S02E03,GEORGE,Im nervous.
S02E03,JERRY,(to the man) Excuse me. Mister Benes?
S02E03,ALTON,Yeah?
S02E03,JERRY,"Im Jerry, Elaines friend, and this is George."
S02E03,GEORGE,"Its a great thrill to meet you, Sir."
S02E03,ALTON,Sit down. Want a drink?
S02E03,JERRY,Sure.
S02E03,ALTON,Whatll you have?
S02E03,JERRY,(to waiter) Ill have a cranberry juice with two limes.
S02E03,GEORGE,"And, Ill have a club soda with no ice."
S02E03,BENES,Ill have another Scotch with plenty of ice.
S02E03,GEORGE,You like ice?
S02E03,ALTON,Huh?
S02E03,GEORGE,"I said, do you like ice?"
S02E03,ALTON,Like it?
S02E03,GEORGE,Dont you think you get more without it?
S02E03,ALTON,Wheres Elaine?
S02E03,JERRY,"Well, we thought she was meeting you earlier. Shes usually pretty punctual. Dont you find that, George?"
S02E03,GEORGE,"Yeah, yeah. Shes punctual... and uh shes been late, sometimes."
S02E03,JERRY,"Yeah, yeah. Sometimes shes on time, and... sometimes shes late."
S02E03,GEORGE,I guess... (chuckles) today shes late.
S02E03,JERRY,It appears that way.
S02E03,GEORGE,Yup.
S02E03,JERRY,Yup.
S02E03,ALTON,Looks like rain.
S02E03,GEORGE,"I know, I know, thats what they said."
S02E03,ALTON,Who said?
S02E03,GEORGE,"The weather guy, Dr. Waldo."
S02E03,ALTON,I dont need anybody to tell me its gonna rain.
S02E03,GEORGE,"No, of course not. I didnt-"
S02E03,ALTON,"All I have to do is stick my head out the window. (The waiter returns with the drinks, and distributes them to the men.) Which ones suppose to be the funny guy?"
S02E03,GEORGE,"(pointing at Jerry) Oh, hes the comedian."
S02E03,JERRY,Im just a regular person.
S02E03,GEORGE,"No, no. Hes just being modest."
S02E03,ALTON,We had a funny guy with us in Korea. Tailgunner. They blew his brains out all over the Pacific. Theres nothing funny about that.
S02E03,JERRY,Would you excuse me a minute? Im gonna go to the bathroom. Ill be right back.
S02E03,GEORGE,I just wanted to tell you that I really enjoyed Fair Game. I thought it was just brilliant.
S02E03,ALTON,Drivel.
S02E03,GEORGE,"Yea, well, maybe some parts."
S02E03,ALTON,(defensive) What parts?
S02E03,GEORGE,"The... drivel... parts. Oh my gosh, I just realized  I have to make a phone call. I-I cant believe- Would you-"
S02E03,GEORGE,Thank you for leaving me alone with him!
S02E03,JERRY,That was brutal. I cant go back out there.
S02E03,GEORGE,"Well, lets just leave."
S02E03,JERRY,Elainell kill me.
S02E03,GEORGE,Where is she?
S02E03,JERRY,Shes gotta be here soon.
S02E03,GEORGE,"How could she leave us alone with this lunatic? Ten more minutes, and thats it! Im leaving. I have to tell you, this guy scares me."
S02E03,JERRY,The waiter was trembling!
S02E03,GEORGE,"If she doesnt show up, we cant possibly have dinner with him alone."
S02E03,JERRY,How are we gonna get out of it?
S02E03,GEORGE,Well say were frightened and we have to go home.
S02E03,JERRY,"Yeah, thats good. Hed clunk our heads together like Moe."
S02E03,GEORGE,I dont know. Just start scratching. Tell him you have the crabs. He was in the military. Hell understand that.
S02E03,JERRY,"All fathers are intimidating. Theyre intimidating because they are fathers. Once a man has children, for the rest of his life, his attitude is, To hell with the world, I can make my own people. Ill eat whatever I want, Ill wear whatever I want, and Ill create whoever I want."
S02E03,ALTON,(to George) Whod you call?
S02E03,GEORGE,(improvising) My uh uncle is having an operation. I just wanted to see how he was.
S02E03,ALTON,What kind of operation?
S02E03,GEORGE,Bone marrow.
S02E03,MANAGER,Mister Benes?
S02E03,ALTON,Yes?
S02E03,MANAGER,A message for you.
S02E03,ALTON,From Elaine. She got tied up. Shell be here in thirty minutes.
S02E03,ALTON,"Yeah, they shouldve taken care of Castro when they had the chance. Like we did in Guatamala in fifty-three."
S02E03,JERRY,"Well, Guatamala..."
S02E03,GEORGE,"Sure, Guatamala..."
S02E03,ALTON,"All right, you boys get yourselves together. Well head up to the restaurant. Ill leave a note for Elaine. Im going to the bathroom."
S02E03,GEORGE,"Come on, lets go!"
S02E03,JERRY,What about Elaine?
S02E03,GEORGE,To hell with Elaine!
S02E03,JERRY,Shell be furious.
S02E03,GEORGE,Were dying here!
S02E03,JERRY,Thats her! Shes here!
S02E03,ELAINE,Im sorry. Im so sorry. Where is Dad?
S02E03,GEORGE,"(contemptuously, imitating Altons voice) Hes in the bathroom."
S02E03,JERRY,(to Elaine) Where have you been?!
S02E03,ELAINE,"Kramer! That... Kramer! Im just about to leave, he calls me up. He begs me to sit in his car for two minutes, so he can pick up these birds..."
S02E03,JERRY,"Oh, you didnt..."
S02E03,ELAINE,"Well, he said hed drive me here right after. So, I am sitting in his car twenty minutes! He doesnt come down. I am freezing. Then a cop comes by, tells me to get out of the car. Hes a city marshal. Hes towing the car away. Kramer owes thousands of dollars in back tickets. He was going to tow it with me in the car! So, they tow the car. Now, I am standing outside, and I am freezing, but I cannot leave because I have to tell him what happened to the car. So, finally, he finally comes down with his giant cage filled with doves. He said he was getting special instructions, that each dove has a different diet... So, were wandering around trying to get a cab, when two of these doves fly out! Now were running down the street after these doves; I almost got hit by a bus! (Elaine sits in Altons chair and takes a deep breath.) So hows everything going over here?"
S02E03,JERRY,Great.
S02E03,GEORGE,Couldnt be better.
S02E03,ELAINE,Good. Cause Dad can make some people a little uncomfortable.
S02E03,JERRY,"Oh, no, no."
S02E03,GEORGE,Get outta here..
S02E03,ELAINE,"Man, Kramer! I could kill him!"
S02E03,JERRY,I cant believe it. You know better than to get involved with Kramer.
S02E03,ELAINE ,He said hed give me a lift.
S02E03,JERRY,"Ah, the lift. Like the lure of the sirens song. Never what it seems to be, yet who among us can resist?"
S02E03,GEORGE,Where do you come up with this stuff?
S02E03,ALTON,"Well, look whos here."
S02E03,ELAINE,"Oh, hi, Dad."
S02E03,ALTON,"Hello, dear."
S02E03,ALTON,Whos the lipstick for?
S02E03,ELAINE,No one.
S02E03,ALTON,Hows your mother?
S02E03,ELAINE,Fine.
S02E03,ALTON,How about you? Are you working?
S02E03,ELAINE,"Yeah, Im reading manuscripts for Pendant Publishing. I told you ten times."
S02E03,ALTON,"Pendant! Those bastards. Well all right, boys. Well go to that Pakistani restaurant on 46th Street. Youre not afraid of a little spice, are you?"
S02E03,GEORGE,(singing) Master of the house/Doling out the charm/Ready with a handshake and an open...
S02E03,ALTON,"Pipe down, chorus boy."
S02E03,ELAINE,Ohh... its snowing. Its beautiful.
S02E03,JERRY,"(to George) Snow. Snow, that cant be good for suede, can it?"
S02E03,GEORGE,I wouldnt think so.
S02E03,JERRY,"What should I do? (to Alton) Uh, were taking a cab, arent we?"
S02E03,ALTON,Cab? Its only five blocks.
S02E03,GEORGE,(to Jerry) Why dont you just turn it inside out?
S02E03,JERRY,Inside out! Great.
S02E03,ALTON,Wait a minute. What the hell do you call this?
S02E03,JERRY,"Oh, I turned my jacket inside out."
S02E03,ALTON,"Well, you look like a damn fool!"
S02E03,JERRY,"Well, its a new suede jacket. It might get ruined."
S02E03,ALTON,"Well, youre not going to walk down the street with me and my daughter dressed like that. Thats for damn sure."
S02E03,GEORGE,"Its uh, it's only a few blocks."
S02E03,JERRY,(to the intercom) Elaine?
S02E03,ELAINE,Yeah.
S02E03,JERRY,Come on up.
S02E03,KRAMER,Hey.
S02E03,JERRY,Hey.
S02E03,KRAMER,Ive gotta feed the birds.
S02E03,JERRY,So?
S02E03,KRAMER,You got any of those mini Ritzes?
S02E03,JERRY,I cant believe I do.
S02E03,KRAMER,"Yeah! Well, are you going out?"
S02E03,JERRY,Yeah.
S02E03,KRAMER,"Hey, wheres your new jacket? (Jerry points to the jacket hanging in the bathroom. Its ruined.) What? (Kramer enters the bathroom, and sees the garment.) Ohhh. What did you do to it?"
S02E03,JERRY,I was out in the snow last night.
S02E03,KRAMER,Dont you know what that does to suede?
S02E03,JERRY,I have an idea. (Elaine enters; to Elaine) We can make the nine-thirty at Cinema Three.
S02E03,ELAINE,"Okay. (to Kramer) Hello. (to Jerry) Listen, thanks again for coming last night. Dad said he had a great time."
S02E03,JERRY,Is he still in town?
S02E03,ELAINE,"No, hes driving back to Maryland tonight."
S02E03,KRAMER,"So, uh... what are you gonna do with that one now?"
S02E03,JERRY,I dont know.
S02E03,KRAMER,(smiling) Well...
S02E03,ELAINE,"(to Jerry) I didnt want to tell you this, but usually he hates everyone."
S02E03,JERRY,Really?
S02E03,KRAMER,You gonna throw this out?
S02E03,JERRY,"Well, I cant wear it."
S02E03,ELAINE,"Yeah, he like you though. Said you reminded him of somebody he knew in Korea."
S02E03,KRAMER,"(to Jerry) Well, if youre just gonna throw it out, you know, I could take it."
S02E03,JERRY,"Yeah, go ahead, take it."
S02E03,ELAINE,Dad thinks George is gay.
S02E03,JERRY,"Oh, because of all the singing?"
S02E03,ELAINE,"No, he pretty much thinks everyone is gay."
S02E03,KRAMER,"Hey, see, I like it like this."
S02E03,ELAINE,"Isnt that...? (Jerry nods.) Oh, is this from the snow last night? (Jerry nods.) Ugh... you know what you shouldve done? You shouldve turned it inside out."
S02E03,JERRY,Ill try and remember that.
S02E03,KRAMER,"Boy, its too bad you gave me this one too."
S02E03,JERRY,"Yeah, too bad."
S02E03,KRAMER,Im gonna have to do something about this lining.
S02E03,ALTON,(singing) Master of the house/Doling out the charm/Ready with a handshake and an open palm...
S02E03,JERRY,"I had a leather jacket that got ruined. Now, why does moisture ruin leather? I dont get this. Arent cows outside most of the time? I dont understand it. When its raining do cows go up to the farmhouse, Let us in, were all wearin leather. Open the door! Were gonna ruin the whole outfit here! Is it suede? I am suede, the whole thing is suede, I cant have this cleaned. Its all I got!"
S02E04,JERRY,"The bad thing about television is that everybody you see on television is doing something better than what youre doing. You ever see anybody on TV like just sliding off the front of the sofa with potato chip crumbs on their face? Some people have a little too much fun on television. The soda commercial people. Where do they summon this enthusiasm? Have you seen them? We have soda, we have soda, we have soda, jumping, laughing, flying through the air. Its a can of soda! Have you ever been standing there and youre watching TV and youre drinking the exact same product that theyre advertising right there on TV, and its like, you know, theyre spiking volleyballs, jet-skiing, girls in bikinis and Im standing there, Maybe Im putting too much ice in mine."
S02E04,GEORGE,"(excited) So then, as we were leaving, we were just kind of standing there, and she was sort of smiling at me, and I wasnt sure if she wanted me to ask her out, because when women smile at me I dont know what it means. Sometimes I interpret it like theyre psychotic or something and I dont know if Im supposed to smile back, I dont know what to do. So I just stood there like  remember how Quayle looked when Benson gave him that Kennedy line? Thats what I looked like."
S02E04,JERRY,So you didnt ask?
S02E04,GEORGE,"No, I froze."
S02E04,JERRY,Counter.
S02E04,GEORGE,"Oh yeah. So wait, wait. A half-hour later Im back in the office, I tell Lloyd the whole story. He says, So why dont you call her? I says, I cant. I couldnt, I couldnt do it right then. For me to ask a woman out I gotta get into a mental state like the karate guys before they break the bricks. So Lloyd calls me a wuss."
S02E04,JERRY,He said wuss?
S02E04,GEORGE,"Yeah. Anyway, he shamed me into it."
S02E04,JERRY,So you called.
S02E04,GEORGE,"Right. And, and to cover my nervousness I started eating an apple, because I think if they hear you chewing on the other end of the phone, it makes you sound casual."
S02E04,JERRY,Yeah. Like a farm boy.
S02E04,GEORGE,"Right. So I call her up, I tell her its me, she gives me an enthusiastic Hi!"
S02E04,JERRY,Wow. The enthusiastic hi. Thats beautiful.
S02E04,GEORGE,"Oh, I dont get the enthusiastic hi, Im outta there."
S02E04,JERRY,"All right, so youre chewing your apple, you got your enthusiastic hi... Go ahead."
S02E04,GEORGE,"So, were talking, and I dont like to go too long before I ask them out, I wanna get it over with right away, so I just blurt out, What are you doing Saturday night?"
S02E04,JERRY,And?
S02E04,GEORGE,She bought.
S02E04,JERRY,Great day in the morning.
S02E04,GEORGE,Then I got off the phone right away.
S02E04,JERRY,"Sure, its like robbing a bank. You dont loiter around in front of the teller holding that big bag of money. You come in, you hit and get out."
S02E04,GEORGE,"Its amazing. We, we both have dates on the same night. I cant remember the last time that happened."
S02E04,GEORGE,I cant stand doing laundry. Thats why I have forty pairs of underwear.
S02E04,CAROL,You do not.
S02E04,GEORGE,"Absolutely. Because instead of doing a wash, I just keep buying underwear. My goal is to have over three hundred and sixty pair. That way, I only have to do wash once a year."
S02E04,JERRY,"(in an attempted Scottish accent) Come on, try it. Let me hear you try a Scottish accent."
S02E04,DONNA,Thats Irish.
S02E04,JERRY,"Irish, Scottish, whats the difference, lassie?"
S02E04,CAROL,"So, uh, thanks for dinner. It was great."
S02E04,GEORGE,Yeah. (clears his throat) We should do this again.
S02E04,CAROL,Would you like to come upstairs for some coffee?
S02E04,GEORGE,"Oh, no, thanks. I cant drink coffee late at night, it keeps me up."
S02E04,CAROL,"(confused by his response) So, um, okay."
S02E04,GEORGE,Okay.
S02E04,CAROL,Goodnight.
S02E04,GEORGE,"Yeah, take it easy."
S02E04,DONNA,Thanks again for the movie.
S02E04,JERRY,Youre welcome.
S02E04,DONNA,"Id invite you up, but the place is being painted."
S02E04,JERRY,"Oh, thats okay."
S02E04,DONNA,Unless you want to go to your place.
S02E04,JERRY,"Okay... but theres no cake or anything, if thats what youre looking for."
S02E04,GEORGE,(frustrated) Take it easy! Huh! Take it easy!
S02E04,JERRY,"I think if ones going to kill oneself, the least you could do is leave a note. Its common courtesy. I dont know. Thats just the way I was brought up."
S02E04,DONNA,Values are very important.
S02E04,JERRY,"Oh, so important. So what are you doing uh Thursday night? You wanna have dinner?"
S02E04,DONNA,Thursdays great.
S02E04,JERRY,"Tan pants. Why do I buy tan pants, Donna? I dont feel comfortable in them."
S02E04,DONNA,Are those Cotton Dockers?
S02E04,JERRY,"Oh, I cant begin to tell you how much I hate that commercial."
S02E04,DONNA,Really? I like that commercial.
S02E04,JERRY,You like that commercial?
S02E04,DONNA,"Yeah, its clever."
S02E04,JERRY,"Now wait a second, you mean the one where the guys are all standing around, supposedly being very casual and witty?"
S02E04,DONNA,"Yeah, thats the one."
S02E04,JERRY,What could you possibly like about that?
S02E04,DONNA,"I dont know. I like the, guys."
S02E04,JERRY,"Yeah, theyre so funny and so comfortable with each other, and I could be comfortable too, if I had pants like that. I could sit on a porch and wrestle around, and maybe even be part of a real bull session."
S02E04,DONNA ,"Hey, I know guys like that. To me the dialogue rings true."
S02E04,JERRY,"Even if the dialogue did ring true. (Donna starts to get annoyed that Jerry won't let the conversation go) Even if somehow somewhere men actually talk like that, what does that have to do with the pants? Doesnt that bother you?"
S02E04,DONNA,"(annoyed) Thats the idea. Thats whats clever about it, that theyre not talking about the pants."
S02E04,JERRY,But theyre talking about nothing.
S02E04,DONNA,Thats the point.
S02E04,JERRY,I know the point.
S02E04,DONNA,No one is telling you to like it.
S02E04,JERRY,"I mean, all those quick shots of the pants. Just pants, pants, pants, pants, pants, pants, pants. What is that supposed to be?"
S02E04,JERRY,"Whats brutal about the date is the scrutiny that you put each other through. Because whenever you think about this person in terms of the future, you have to magnify everything about them. You know, like the guyll be like, I dont think her eyebrows are even. Could I look at uneven eyebrows for the rest of my life? And of course the womans looking at the guy, thinking, What is he looking at? Do I want somebody looking at me like this for the rest of my life?"
S02E04,JERRY,"Im supposed to see her again on Thursday, but can I go out with someone who actually likes this commercial?"
S02E04,ELAINE,I once broke up with a guy because he didnt keep his bathroom clean enough.
S02E04,JERRY,No kidding. Did you tell him that was the reason?
S02E04,ELAINE,"Oh yeah, I told him all the time. You would not have believed his tub. Germs were building a town in there  they were constructing offices. Houses near the drain were going for a hundred and fifty thousand dollars."
S02E04,ELAINE,Hi.
S02E04,JERRY,Youre still thinking about this?
S02E04,GEORGE,"She invites me up at twelve oclock at night, for coffee, and I dont go up. No thank you. I dont want coffee. It keeps me up. Too late for me to drink coffee. I said this to her. People this stupid shouldnt be allowed to live. I cant imagine what she must think of me."
S02E04,JERRY,She thinks youre a guy that doesnt like coffee.
S02E04,GEORGE,"She invited me up. Coffees not coffee, coffee is sex."
S02E04,ELAINE,Maybe coffee was coffee.
S02E04,GEORGE,Coffees coffee in the morning. Its not coffee at twelve oclock at night.
S02E04,ELAINE,Well some people drink coffee that late.
S02E04,GEORGE,"Yeah, people who work at NORAD, whore on twenty-four hour missile watch. Everything was going along so great. She was laughing, I was funny... I kept saying to myself, Keep it up, dont blow it, youre doing great."
S02E04,ELAINE,Its all in your head. All she knows is she had a good time. I think you should call her.
S02E04,GEORGE,I cant call her now. Its too soon. Im planning a Wednesday call.
S02E04,ELAINE,"Oh, why? I love it when guys call me the next day."
S02E04,GEORGE,"Of course you do, but youre imagining a guy you like, not a guy who goes, Oh no, I dont drink coffee late at night. If I call her now, shes gonna think Im too needy. Women dont wanna see need. They want a take-charge guy  a colonel, a Kaiser, a tsar."
S02E04,ELAINE,All shell think is that you like her.
S02E04,GEORGE,That's exactly what I'm trying to avoid!
S02E04,ELAINE,"Well, she wants you to like her."
S02E04,GEORGE,"Yes, she wants me to like her, if she likes me. But she doesnt like me!"
S02E04,ELAINE,I dont know what your parents did to you.
S02E04,KRAMER,"Hey, I just thought of a really funny thing for your act. All right, youre up there, youre on the stage and you go, Hey, you ever notice how cars here in New York, they never get out of the way of ambulances anymore. Someones in a life-and-death situation, and were thinking, Well, sorry buddy, you shouldve thought of that when you were eating cheese omelettes and sauages for breakfast every morning for the last thirty years."
S02E04,KRAMER,So you gonna use it?
S02E04,JERRY ,I dont think so.
S02E04,KRAMER,Its funny.
S02E04,ELAINE,It is funny.
S02E04,JERRY,I like to use my own material.
S02E04,KRAMER,Thats as good as anything you do.
S02E04,GEORGE,"All right, I gotta make a call. Everybody out, come on."
S02E04,JERRY,Why do we have to leave?
S02E04,GEORGE,"Because I cant call a woman with other people in the room. Come on, lets go."
S02E04,ELAINE,"Oh, see, this is the problem."
S02E04,JERRY,Youre kicking me out of my house?
S02E04,GEORGE,Yes.
S02E04,ELAINE,(encouraging) Dont forget.
S02E04,GEORGE,"(to Elaine) Right, alright. (to Jerry) Oh Jerry, do you have any apples?"
S02E04,JERRY,Dont do the apples. Its enough already with the apples.
S02E04,CAROL,"(from the phone; a recorded message) Hi, its Carol, Ill get back to you."
S02E04,GEORGE,"Um, hi, its George, George Costanza, remember me? The guy that didnt come up for coffee. You see, I didnt realise that coffee didnt really mean... well, whatever. Anyway, it was fun. It was... it was fun, so... oh boy, um, so... You call me back. If you want. Its up to you, you know, whatever you wanna do. Either way. The balls in your court. So uh, take it easy."
S02E04,JERRY,"Im just gonna get my jacket, Ill meet you downstairs. Whats the matter, did you call?"
S02E04,GEORGE,"Got her machine. Im dead, Im a dead man. Thats it. Im dead, Im a dead man. Dead man."
S02E04,JERRY,What did you say?
S02E04,GEORGE,"I dont know what the hell I said. I gave her an ultimatum and theres nothing I can do. Its a machine. The little light is blinking right now, Come and listen to the idiot. Hey everybody, the idiots on!"
S02E04,JERRY,After one date you try and improvise on her machine?
S02E04,GEORGE,Now Im in the worst position of all.
S02E04,ELAINE,"Yknow, my brother-in-law once left a message on this guys machine, and he blurted out some business information he wasnt supposed to, and it would have cost him fifteen thousand dollars, so he waited outside the guys house and when the guy came home he went upstairs with him and he switched the tape."
S02E04,GEORGE,He did that?
S02E04,ELAINE,Yeah.
S02E04,GEORGE,Somebody did that?
S02E04,JERRY,Shell call you back. Youre overreacting.
S02E04,JERRY,Not once.
S02E04,DONNA,Never?
S02E04,JERRY,"I have never seen one episode of I Love Lucy in my life, ever."
S02E04,DONNA,Thats amazing.
S02E04,JERRY,Thank you.
S02E04,DONNA,Is there anything else about you I should know?
S02E04,JERRY,"Yes, Im lactose intolerant."
S02E04,DONNA,Really?
S02E04,JERRY,"I have no patience for lactose. And I wont stand for it. Um, Ill be right back."
S02E04,GEORGE,"Wait till you hear this! (George sees Donna and no Jerry.) Whoa, ah, Im sorry, I didnt, I had no idea."
S02E04,DONNA,"Wait, wait. Hes in the bathroom."
S02E04,GEORGE,"I just wanted to talk to him for a minute, but Ill come back."
S02E04,DONNA,You dont have to leave.
S02E04,GEORGE,You sure?
S02E04,DONNA,Yes.
S02E04,GEORGE,Okay.
S02E04,DONNA,Im Donna.
S02E04,GEORGE,"Donna. Oh, youre the one that likes that commercial!"
S02E04,DONNA,He told you about that?
S02E04,GEORGE,"(back-pedalling) No, he, he didnt actually tell me that, uh, we were talking about that commercial  in fact I think I brought it up because I like that commercial. No, he, he would never tell me anything. He never discusses anything. Hes, hes like a clam. Youre not gonna mention this, to him..."
S02E04,DONNA,(to Jerry) So you go around telling your friends Im not hip because I like that commercial.
S02E04,JERRY,"What? (to George) What did, what did you say?"
S02E04,GEORGE,"Say? What? Nothing, I..."
S02E04,DONNA,You told him how I like the commercial.
S02E04,JERRY,"Well, so what if I said that?"
S02E04,DONNA,"Well, so, you didnt have to tell your friends."
S02E04,JERRY,"No, I had to tell my friends  my friends didnt have to tell you."
S02E04,GEORGE,(to Donna) Why did you have to get me in trouble?
S02E04,DONNA,I dont like you talking about me with your friends behind my back.
S02E04,GEORGE,Boy oh boy.
S02E04,JERRY,I said I couldnt believe you liked that commercial. So what?
S02E04,DONNA,"I asked some friends of mine this week, and all of them liked the commercial."
S02E04,JERRY,"Boy, I bet you got a regular Algonquin round table there."
S02E04,KRAMER,Hey.
S02E04,JERRY,"Oh uh, Kramer, this is Donna."
S02E04,KRAMER,Oh. Cotton Dockers!
S02E04,GEORGE,"Hello! All right, we should be going. Come on..."
S02E04,KRAMER,What? Where are we going?
S02E04,GEORGE,Come on!
S02E04,DONNA,"Dont bother, Im leaving."
S02E04,JERRY,"Donna, really, youre making too much of this."
S02E04,KRAMER,"One hundred percent Cotton Dockers. If theyre not Dockers, theyre just pants"
S02E04,JERRY,"Please, Donna..."
S02E04,DONNA,I dont wanna hear it.
S02E04,GEORGE,"I cant believe I said that. You know me, Im a vault."
S02E04,JERRY,"Dont worry about it, it wasnt working anyway."
S02E04,KRAMER,What happened there?
S02E04,JERRY,Ill tell you later.
S02E04,GEORGE,You are not gonna believe whats going on with this woman.
S02E04,GEORGE,"Okay, so you remember I made the initial call Sunday, she doesnt call back. I call again Monday, I leave another message. I call Tuesday, I get the machine again, I know youre there, I dont know what your story is. Yesterday, Im a volcano  I try one more call, the machine comes on, and I let fly like Mussolini from the balcony, Where the hell do you get the nerve? You invite me up for coffee and then you dont call me back for four days? I dont like coffee, I dont have to come up. Id like to get one more shot at the coffee just so I could spit it in your face."
S02E04,JERRY,You said that?
S02E04,GEORGE,I lost it.
S02E04,JERRY,I cant blame you. I cant believe she never called you back.
S02E04,GEORGE,She did. Today.
S02E04,JERRY,What?
S02E04,GEORGE,"She called my office. She said shes been in the Hamptons since Sunday. She didnt know if I was trying to get in touch with her. Her machine broke, and shes been using her old machine and she doesnt have the beeper for it."
S02E04,JERRY,So she didnt get the messages.
S02E04,GEORGE,"Exactly, but theyre on there  waiting. She said she cant wait to see me, were having dinner tonight. Shes supposed to call me as soon as she gets home."
S02E04,JERRY,But what about the messages?
S02E04,JERRY,Elaines thing? How you gonna get in?
S02E04,GEORGE,Ill meet her outside the building.
S02E04,JERRY,But you know as soon as she gets in the apartment shes going right for that machine.
S02E04,GEORGE,"Unless she goes for the bathroom. Thats my only chance. (George crumbles. He drops the cassette on the table.) Who am I kidding? I cant do this, I cant do this. I dont even know how to work those stupid machines."
S02E04,JERRY,"Theres nothing to it. You lift the lid, it comes right out."
S02E04,GEORGE,You do it for me.
S02E04,JERRY,What?
S02E04,GEORGE,"Come on, itll be so much easier."
S02E04,JERRY,How you gonna get me up there?
S02E04,GEORGE,"Ill tell her I bumped into you, Im giving you a ride uptown."
S02E04,JERRY,And who makes the switch?
S02E04,GEORGE,You do.
S02E04,JERRY,I do.
S02E04,GEORGE ,"I cant do it. Ill, Ill keep her busy."
S02E04,JERRY,I cant get involved in this.
S02E04,GEORGE,I think I may be in love with this woman.
S02E04,JERRY,What if she sees me?
S02E04,GEORGE,"Oh, you are such a wuss."
S02E04,JERRY,A wuss?
S02E04,GEORGE,Yeah.
S02E04,JERRY,Did you call me a wuss?
S02E04,GEORGE,Well there is traffic. It might take her till eight-fifteen.
S02E04,JERRY,"I got one problem. Youre keeping her busy in the other room. Now, what if she somehow gets away from you and is coming in? You have to signal me that shes coming."
S02E04,GEORGE,"A signal, right, um, okay, uh, okay, the signal is, Ill call out tippy-toe!"
S02E04,JERRY,Tippy Toe? I dont think so.
S02E04,GEORGE,You dont like tippy toe?
S02E04,JERRY,No tippy toe.
S02E04,GEORGE,"All right, uh, okay, I got it, um, Ill sing."
S02E04,JERRY,What song?
S02E04,GEORGE,How Do You Solve A Problem Like Maria?
S02E04,JERRY,What is that?
S02E04,GEORGE,"Oh, its a lovely song. (singing) How do you solve a problem like Maria?..."
S02E04,JERRY,Anything else?
S02E04,GEORGE,You pick it.
S02E04,JERRY,Lemon Tree.
S02E04,GEORGE,"Peter, Paul and Mary."
S02E04,JERRY,"No, Trini Lopez."
S02E04,JERRY & GEORGE,"(singing) Lemon tree, very pretty and a lemon flower..."
S02E04,GEORGE,Alright ok. You got the tape?
S02E04,JERRY,Standard. Micro.
S02E04,GEORGE,How do you feel? Confident?
S02E04,JERRY,Feel good.
S02E04,GEORGE,You nervous?
S02E04,JERRY,Not at all.
S02E04,GEORGE,"Get up, get up, its her! Oh, the hell with this, Im scared to death, just walk away, its off, cancel everything, go!"
S02E04,CAROL,Hey! What are you doing here? I thought I was supposed to call you when I got home.
S02E04,GEORGE,"I, I couldnt wait. I was too anxious to see you."
S02E04,CAROL,"Oh, thats so sweet."
S02E04,GEORGE,"Oh, this is my friend, Jerry Seinfeld. I just bumped into him around the corner. Isnt that a coincidence? The funny thing is, I see him all the time."
S02E04,JERRY,All the time.
S02E04,CAROL,Its nice to meet you.
S02E04,JERRY,Hi.
S02E04,CAROL,"So, Im starving. Where are we gonna eat?"
S02E04,GEORGE,"You know, we could go uptown, and that way we could give Jerry a ride home."
S02E04,CAROL,"Okay. Lets go, Im ready, whered you park?"
S02E04,GEORGE,Dont you wanna go upstairs first?
S02E04,CAROL,"No, what for? Ill just give my bag to the doorman."
S02E04,JERRY,"You know, I really need to use the bathroom."
S02E04,CAROL,Oh well theres a bathroom in the coffee shop just next door.
S02E04,GEORGE,"Yes, yes, but uh, I have to make a call, so..."
S02E04,CAROL,Well they have a phone.
S02E04,GEORGE,I know Jerry. He has this phobia about public toilets. I think we really should go upstairs.
S02E04,CAROL,"(aloud) You know, I think I will go upstairs. I can check my machine."
S02E04,GEORGE,"Right, right."
S02E04,CAROL,The bathrooms on the hall to the right.
S02E04,JERRY,"Uh, you know, why dont you go first, you just had a long trip."
S02E04,CAROL,"No, Im fine."
S02E04,JERRY,"Um, you know, its the damnedest thing. It went away."
S02E04,CAROL,"Oh, thats weird."
S02E04,GEORGE,"No, no that can happen. Ive, uh, Ive read about that in medical journals. Its a freak thing, but..."
S02E04,CAROL,"Well, let me just check my messages, and well go."
S02E04,GEORGE,"Uh, Carol, can I talk to you for a second? Right now?"
S02E04,CAROL,Sure.
S02E04,GEORGE,"Please, this is very, very important."
S02E04,GEORGE,"(from other room) Uh, tippy toe! Tippy toe! Lemon tree!"
S02E04,CAROL,"(to Jerry) Now I know who you are! Youre a comedian. Ive seen you, its driving me crazy."
S02E04,JERRY,Right. I am.
S02E04,GEORGE,"Carol, thats so rude. Please, Im serious, just for a moment, if you wouldnt mind. And then well talk to Jerry."
S02E04,JERRY,(calls) Hey you two. Im ready to go.
S02E04,CAROL,Thats what you had to tell me? Your father wears sneakers in the pool?
S02E04,GEORGE,(to Jerry) Dont you find that strange?
S02E04,JERRY,Yes.
S02E04,CAROL,"Well, Ill just check my machine and well go."
S02E04,CAROL,"No, nothing here, lets go. (Carol, George and Jerry head for the door. Carol opens it.) Oh, I forgot to tell you. After I talked to you today my neighbour called me and played my messages to me over the phone."
S02E04,GEORGE,"Oh, uh..."
S02E04,CAROL,"Yours were hilarious, we were both cracking up. I just love jokes like that."
S02E04,JERRY,"I love my phone machine. I wish I was a phone machine. I wish if I saw somebody on the street I didnt want to talk to, I could go, Excuse me, Im not in right now. If you would just leave a message, I could walk away. I also have a cordless phone, but I dont like that as much, because you cant slam down a cordless phone. You get mad at somebody on a real phone  You cant talk to me like that! Bang! You know. You get mad at somebody on a cordless phone  You cant talk to me like that!"
S02E05,JERRY,"Well, I painted my apartment again. Ive been living in this apartment for years and years, and every time I paint it, it kinda gets me down. I look around, and I think, well, its a little bit smaller now. You know, I realize its just the thickness of the paint, but Im aware of it. It just coming in and coming in. Every-time I paint it, its closer and closer. I dont even know where the wall outlets are anymore. I just look for like a lump with two slots in it. Kinda looks like a pig is trying to push his way through from the other side. Thats where I plug in. My idea of the perfect living room would be the bridge on the Starship Enterprise. You know what I mean? Big chair, nice screen, remote control... Thats why Star Trek really was the ultimate male fantasy. Just hurtling through space in your living room, watching TV. Thats why all the aliens were always dropping in, because Kirk was the only one that had the big screen. They came over Friday nights, Klingon boxing, gotta be there."
S02E05,JERRY,What did you do?
S02E05,KRAMER,Mousse. I moussed up.
S02E05,ELAINE,I guess it was just a matter of time.
S02E05,KRAMER,"You know, I should've done this years ago. I mean, I feel like I've had two lives. My pre-mousse. And now, I begin my post-mousse. Hey, tell me the truth, have you ever seen a better looking guy?"
S02E05,JERRY,"Well, looks are so subjective."
S02E05,ELAINE,"I dont mean to interrupt or anything, but on Sunday, my friend is having a brunch for the New York Marathon."
S02E05,KRAMER,"(annoyed that he forgot) Oh, I keep forgetting to enter that!"
S02E05,ELAINE,"She lives right above First Avenue, says she has a perfect view of the race. And she said I can invite some friends."
S02E05,JERRY,Maybe.
S02E05,HAROLD,"(O.S.) No, Im not going up there."
S02E05,JERRY,(to Elaine) Harold and Manny.
S02E05,HAROLD,Im not going.
S02E05,JERRY,"Boys, boys."
S02E05,HAROLD,"Oh, Jerry."
S02E05,JERRY,"I slid the rent under your door, Harold. Did you get it?"
S02E05,HAROLD,"Yeah, yeah... Hey, Jerry, would you like anything from Mrs. Hudwalkers apartment?"
S02E05,MANNY,(in Spanish) You can't give him anything from there!
S02E05,HAROLD,I was only joking. (to Jerry) He thinks Im gonna give you Mrs. Hudwalkers things.
S02E05,MANNY,(in Spanish) You offered them to him.
S02E05,HAROLD,(to Jerry) We have to go up there now and clean the apartment. Its a good thing her rent was overdue. Shed be rotting up there for a month.
S02E05,JERRY,She died? Mrs. Hudwalker died?
S02E05,HAROLD,Ninety-four years old. I found her yesterday. She didnt have her wig on. It was horrifying.
S02E05,MANNY,"(in Spanish) Harold, Come on, hurry up!"
S02E05,HAROLD,"(to Manny) Whats the matter with you? Im talking! So, Jerry, you know anyone who needs an apartment?"
S02E05,JERRY,Are you kidding? You know my friend Elaine?
S02E05,HAROLD,"Oh yeah, I like her. She always says hello to me."
S02E05,JERRY,Its not promised to anybody? Cause shed take it in a second.
S02E05,HAROLD,"Well, Manny wanted it for his brother, but he got deported."
S02E05,MANNY,(in spanish) What do you mean deported? It was a misunderstanding with the Department of Immigration.
S02E05,HAROLD,Whats the difference? Its true!
S02E05,JERRY,"So, its okay? I could just tell her she can have it?"
S02E05,HAROLD,"Sure, sure. Shes getting a bargain, too. Its only four hundred dollars a month."
S02E05,MANNY,(in Spanish) Four hundred dollars? What are you nuts? Someone will pay more.
S02E05,HAROLD,Okay...
S02E05,HAROLD,Okay!
S02E05,KRAMER,"Hey, Harold, what do you think?"
S02E05,HAROLD,"Manny, look. Kramer put mousse in his hair."
S02E05,MANNY,(in Spanish) It looks worse.
S02E05,KRAMER,"(not understanding him) Hey, thanks."
S02E05,ELAINE,What was that all about?
S02E05,JERRY,"(coyly) Oh, nothing important."
S02E05,ELAINE,Whats going on? What is that look?
S02E05,JERRY,What look? Nothing.
S02E05,ELAINE,Somethings going on here.
S02E05,JERRY,"I dont know if you should sit for this or not. Sitting is good if you faint, but standing is good for jumping up and down. I cant decide."
S02E05,ELAINE,Jumping up and down? What are you talking about? Cmon. Cough it up.
S02E05,JERRY,"Oh, Elaine. You know the way I am  rarely ever thinking of myself. My only concern is the welfare and happiness of those close to me. Sure, it hurts sometimes to give, and give, and give..."
S02E05,ELAINE,Would you please?
S02E05,JERRY,What would you say if I told you that...
S02E05,ELAINE,Told me what?!
S02E05,JERRY,...I got you an apartment in this building.
S02E05,ELAINE,(dumbfounded) No.
S02E05,JERRY,Yes.
S02E05,ELAINE,No.
S02E05,JERRY,Yes.
S02E05,ELAINE,You didnt.
S02E05,JERRY,I did.
S02E05,ELAINE,You got me an apartment in the building?!
S02E05,JERRY,I got you an apartment in the building.
S02E05,ELAINE,How did you...
S02E05,JERRY,Remember Mrs. Hudwalker? The ninety-four-year-old woman who lived above me?
S02E05,ELAINE,No.
S02E05,JERRY,She died.
S02E05,ELAINE,(thrilled) She died?!
S02E05,JERRY,She died.
S02E05,ELAINE,She died!
S02E05,JERRY,And the rent is only four hundred dollars a month!
S02E05,ELAINE,Get out!
S02E05,ELAINE,Four hundred a month? Only four hundred a month?!
S02E05,JERRY,Four hundred a month.
S02E05,ELAINE,And Ill be right upstairs?
S02E05,JERRY,Right upstairs.
S02E05,ELAINE,Right above you?
S02E05,JERRY,Right above me.
S02E05,ELAINE,"Oh, were neighbors. Ill be here all the time!"
S02E05,JERRY,All the time.
S02E05,ELAINE,"(overly excited) We can exchange keys so we can come in and out. Oh, this is going to be great!"
S02E05,JERRY,All the time.
S02E05,JERRY,"The problem with talking is that nobody stops you from saying the wrong thing. I think life would be a lot better if it was like youre always making a movie. You mess up, somebody just walks on the set, and stops the whole shot. You know what I mean? Think of the things you wish you could take back. Youre out somewhere with people, Gee, you look pregnant.. are you? Cut, cut, cut, cut, cut, thats not gonna work at all. Walk out the door, and come back in. Lets take this whole scene again. People, think about what youre saying!"
S02E05,GEORGE,"Thanks, see you later, Donna."
S02E05,GEORGE,What happened to you?
S02E05,JERRY,You cant believe what I just did.
S02E05,GEORGE,What? What did you do?
S02E05,JERRY,"I could tell you what I did, but you wouldnt believe it. Its not believable."
S02E05,GEORGE,What did you do?
S02E05,JERRY,How could I have done that?
S02E05,GEORGE,Done what?
S02E05,JERRY,I told Elaine about an apartment opening up in my building. Shes going to move in.
S02E05,GEORGE,Elaines moving into your building?
S02E05,JERRY,Yes. Right above me.
S02E05,GEORGE,Right above you?
S02E05,JERRY,Yeah.
S02E05,GEORGE,Youre gonna be neighbors.
S02E05,JERRY,I know. Neighbors.
S02E05,GEORGE,Shes right above you?
S02E05,JERRY,Right above me.
S02E05,GEORGE,How could you do that?
S02E05,JERRY,"Cause Im an idiot! You may think youre an idiot, but with all due respect, Im a much bigger idiot than you are."
S02E05,GEORGE,"Dont insult me, my friend. Remember who youre talking to. No ones a bigger idiot than me."
S02E05,JERRY,Did you ever ask an ex-girlfriend to move into your building?
S02E05,GEORGE,Did you ever go to a singles weekend in the Poconos?
S02E05,JERRY,"Shes right in my building! Right above me! Every time I come in the building, Im gonna have to sneak around like a cat burglar."
S02E05,GEORGE,Youre doomed. Youre gonna have to have all your sex at womens apartments. Itll be like a permanent road trip. Forget about the home bed advantage.
S02E05,JERRY,But I need the home bed advantage.
S02E05,GEORGE,Of course. We all do.
S02E05,JERRY,Come in for two minutes and sit with me.
S02E05,GEORGE,I was just in there. Its embarrassing.
S02E05,JERRY,"Oh, whos gonna know?"
S02E05,GEORGE,They saw me walk out.
S02E05,JERRY,Two minutes.
S02E05,JERRY,My censoring system broke down. You know that little guy in your head who watches everything you say? Makes sure you dont make a mistake? He went for a cup of coffee. And in that second ruined my life.
S02E05,GEORGE,My censor quit two years ago. He checked into a clinic. Emotionally exhausted.
S02E05,JERRY,"So, is there any way out of this Elaine thing?"
S02E05,GEORGE,Tough.
S02E05,JERRY,"You know, the water pressures terrible in my building. And she loves a good shower."
S02E05,GEORGE,I never heard of anyone would turned down an apartment because of a weak shower spray.
S02E05,JERRY,"If they were fanatic about showers, they might."
S02E05,GEORGE,"For that rent, shed take a bath in the toilet tank if she had to."
S02E05,JERRY,"Look at that woman feeding her baby greasy, disgusting, coffee shop corned beef hash. Isnt that child abuse?"
S02E05,GEORGE,"Id like to have a kid. Of course, you have to have a date first... Remember my friend, Adam, from Detroit?"
S02E05,JERRY,"Yeah, the guy with the flat head."
S02E05,GEORGE,"Hes a cube. Anyway, he got married six months ago. He told me ever since hes been wearing a wedding band, women have been coming on to him everywhere he goes."
S02E05,JERRY,"Yeah, Ive heard that about wedding bands."
S02E05,GEORGE,I wonder if thats really true.
S02E05,JERRY,"That would be an interesting sociological experiment. You know, Kramer has his fathers band. Hed loan it to you."
S02E05,GEORGE,Thanks a lot. Ill give it back to you in a week.
S02E05,KRAMER,"You know, I dont even know why youre fooling around with this ring. Ive been telling you, get yourself some plugs. Or a piece."
S02E05,GEORGE,Im not doing that.
S02E05,KRAMER,"Oh, man. You know, youre crazy. Youre a good looking guy. What do you want to walk around like that for?"
S02E05,GEORGE,"No, Ill put half a can of mousse in my head like you."
S02E05,HAROLD,"I told you I dont like these sponges, theyre too small! I want a big sponge!"
S02E05,HAROLD,You cant pick up anything with these! Theres no absorption!
S02E05,JERRY,"Boys, boys."
S02E05,HAROLD,"Hi, Jerry."
S02E05,MANNY,"Hello, Jerry. (in spanish to Harold) You tell him."
S02E05,HAROLD,Okay
S02E05,MANNY,(in spanish to Harold again) You tell him.
S02E05,HAROLD,"Your friend cant have the apartment, Jerry."
S02E05,JERRY,What?
S02E05,HAROLD,Because somebody offered Manny five thousand dollars for the apartment. I dont want to do it. Manny wants to do it.
S02E05,MANNY,(in spanish) Why are you telling him it's my fault?
S02E05,HAROLD,Because its true! Why shouldnt I tell him?
S02E05,JERRY,"Hey, hey. I understand. Youre businessmen."
S02E05,MANNY,(in spanish) Tell him that if his friend can come up with the same money then she can have the apartment.
S02E05,HAROLD,"Oh, now, he says that if your friend has five thousand dollars, well give it to her."
S02E05,JERRY,"Well, thats a lot of money. But, if thats the way its gotta be, thats the way its gotta be."
S02E05,JERRY,"You know, I used to think that the universe is a random, chaotic sequence of meaningless events, but I see now that there is reason and purpose to all things."
S02E05,GEORGE,What happened to you?
S02E05,JERRY,"Religion, my friend, thats what happened to me. Because, I have just been informed that its going to cost Elaine the sum of five thousand dollars to get the apartment upstairs."
S02E05,GEORGE,(jubilant) Five thousand dollars? She doesnt have five thousand dollars!
S02E05,JERRY,Of course she doesnt have five thousand dollars!
S02E05,GEORGE,"So, she cant get the apartment."
S02E05,JERRY,Cant get it.
S02E05,GEORGE,"So, she doesnt move in."
S02E05,JERRY,"No move. So, you see, its all part of a divine plan."
S02E05,GEORGE,And how does the baldness fit into that plan?
S02E05,JERRY,(to the intercom) Elaine?
S02E05,ELAINE,Yeah.
S02E05,JERRY,"(to George) All right, this is going to require some great acting now. I have to pretend Im disappointed. Youre going to really see me being a phony, now. I hope you can take this. Maybe you should go in the other room."
S02E05,GEORGE,Are you kidding? I lie every second of the day. My whole life is a sham!
S02E05,JERRY,"Cause you know, I love Elaine."
S02E05,GEORGE,Of course you do.
S02E05,JERRY,"But you know... not in the building. Really, I feel terrible about this. My intentions were good. What can I do? Tell me."
S02E05,ELAINE,"(to someone in the hallway) No, Ill be seeing you. (She enters the apartment; singing) ""Good morning, good morning.. (to Jerry and George) Have you ever gotten up in the morning and felt its great to be alive? That every breath is a gift of sweet life from above?"
S02E05,ELAINE,"Oh, and before I forget, I have the checks for the first month, last months security deposit. (laughs) I have seventy-five dollars left in my account."
S02E05,JERRY,Well... theres a little bit of a problem.
S02E05,ELAINE,"Oh, I know. Theres a weak shower spray, I know. Ive already thought about it, and Im switching to baths. As Winston Churchill said, Why stand when you can sit? Maybe Ill get some rubber duckies."
S02E05,JERRY,"Uh, no uh, someone offered Harold and Manny five thousand for the apartment. Im sure theyd just as soon give it to you, but youd have to come up with that money."
S02E05,ELAINE,Five thousand dollars? I dont have five thousand dollars.
S02E05,JERRY,I know.
S02E05,ELAINE,(disappointed) How am I going to get five thousand dollars?
S02E05,JERRY,I have no idea.
S02E05,KRAMER,"(to Elaine) Hey, my new neighbor!"
S02E05,ELAINE,Im not moving in.
S02E05,KRAMER,What?
S02E05,ELAINE,They want five thousand dollars now.
S02E05,KRAMER,"So, okay uh whats the problem?"
S02E05,ELAINE,I dont have five thousand dollars.
S02E05,KRAMER,"Cmon, you can come up with five thousand dollars. (to Jerry) Jerry, you dont have five thousand dollars you can led her? Come on."
S02E05,JERRY,"Yeah, well, I didnt- Is that something you want to borrow?"
S02E05,ELAINE,"No, thats too much money to borrow."
S02E05,KRAMER,Loan her the money. You can afford it.
S02E05,JERRY,She doesnt wanna borrow the money.
S02E05,KRAMER,"Oh, cmon. Shell pay you back. Whats five grand between friends?"
S02E05,ELAINE,Of course Id pay you back..
S02E05,KRAMER,"Yeah, so whats the problem?"
S02E05,JERRY,Who said theres a problem?
S02E05,KRAMER,Hey see He said hed loan you the money.
S02E05,ELAINE,"Well Jerry, it might take a while for me to pay you back. Maybe a few years. How do you feel about that?"
S02E05,KRAMER,Thats okay. He doesnt care.
S02E05,ELAINE,"Well, you know, money can sometimes come between friends."
S02E05,KRAMER,Get outta here.
S02E05,ELAINE,Let me think about it.
S02E05,KRAMER,Whats to think about?
S02E05,ELAINE,I dont know... I dont know. Five thousand... let me just take one more look at it.
S02E05,JERRY,"(to Kramer) It was all over! Taken care of. Done! Finished. Five thousand. Wheres she gonna get five thousand? She doesnt have five thousand. Clean. Good bye. Shes gone. Then you come in, Why dont you loan her five thousand? What do you care? Youve got five thousand. Give her five thousand!"
S02E05,KRAMER,You didnt want her in the building?
S02E05,JERRY,"No, I didnt!"
S02E05,KRAMER,"Well, then what did you loan her the five thousand for? Oh, look, maybe she wont take it. I mean, she did say that she was gonna think about it."
S02E05,JERRY,People dont turn down money. Its what separates us from the animals.
S02E05,KRAMER,I still dont understand what the problem is having her in the building.
S02E05,JERRY,"Let me explain something to you. You see, youre not normal. Youre a great guy, I love you, but youre a pod. I, on the other hand, am a human being. I sometimes feel awkward, uncomfortable, even inhibited in certain situations with the other human beings. You wouldnt understand."
S02E05,KRAMER,Because Im a pod?
S02E05,ELAINE,Ill take it!
S02E05,ROXANNE,"Hi, Elaine."
S02E05,ELAINE,"Oh, hi, Roxanne. Nice to be here. These are my friends. This is George, and this is Jerry."
S02E05,JERRY,Hi
S02E05,ELAINE,Jerrys the one who got me my new apartment.
S02E05,ROXANNE,"So, youre Elaines hero."
S02E05,JERRY,"Yes, its my lifes work."
S02E05,ROXANNE,There are so few true heroes left in this world.
S02E05,GEORGE,"Yeah, my wife couldnt make it today. Shes got something with her mother... Who knows whats going on with her. Dont let any one kid you, its tough."
S02E05,JERRY,"Well, better load up on some carbos before the race."
S02E05,ROXANNE,"Oh, the marathon is great, isnt it?"
S02E05,JERRY,"Oh, yes. Particularly if youre not in it."
S02E05,ROXANNE,I wish we had a view of the finish line.
S02E05,JERRY,"Whats to see? A woman from Norway, a guy from Kenya, and twenty thousand losers."
S02E05,GEORGE,"...yeah, my wife started getting on me about the lawn today. Im tellin you, its one thing after another."
S02E05,RITA,Is she here?
S02E05,GEORGE,"Uh no no, shes working."
S02E05,RITA,What does she do?
S02E05,GEORGE,"Shes an... etymologist. You know, bees, flies, gnats. W-What about you?"
S02E05,RITA,"I work for the Director of Madison Square Garden. Its great! I can get free tickets to any sporting in New York. Anyway, shes a very luck woman. Enjoy the race."
S02E05,GEORGE,(calling after her) But..
S02E05,ROXANNE,Hi Stan. Joanne.
S02E05,ELAINE,"Jerry, this is Joanne, and this is Stan. Theyre in my short story class with Roxanne and me."
S02E05,JERRY,Hi how are ya?
S02E05,ELAINE,"Hey, Jerry just got me a great apartment in his building!"
S02E05,JOANNE,"Well, Jerry, itll be nice having a close friend nearby."
S02E05,JERRY,(no amused) Fantastic.
S02E05,STAN,She can pop in whenever she wants.
S02E05,JERRY,I know.
S02E05,JOANNE,She doesnt even need to knock!
S02E05,JERRY,Its tremendous.
S02E05,STAN,Anytime of day.
S02E05,JERRY,Im in heaven.
S02E05,ELAINE,"Oh, Rita come here. This is Jerry. Hes the one who got me the apartment."
S02E05,RITA,"Oh, hi. (calling to someone) Bob, this is the guy who got Elaine the apartment."
S02E05,GEORGE,"Im sorry, I dont see the big deal about being a matador. The bull charges, you move the cape, whats so hard?"
S02E05,SUSIE,"So uh, are you really married? Because, Ive actually heard of single guys who wear wedding bands to attract women."
S02E05,GEORGE,(laughs) Youd have to be a real loser to try something like that.
S02E05,SUSIE,"Thats too bad, because I really have a thing for bald guys with glasses."
S02E05,RITA,Hey everybody! Here come the runners!
S02E05,ELAINE,"(to Jerry) So you and Roxanne are hitting it off, huh?"
S02E05,JERRY,"Oh, I wouldnt quite say that."
S02E05,ELAINE,"Really? From a distance, you seemed to be coming on to her."
S02E05,JERRY,Im a guy  it always looks like that.
S02E05,ELAINE,"Because, I was thinking... are you at all concerned that living in the same building will, yknow... cramp our styles?"
S02E05,JERRY,Nah...
S02E05,ELAINE,"Because, I was worried that there might be a situation in which one of us come home with somebody, it could get a little uncomfortable. But, as long as youre okay with it, its fine with me."
S02E05,JANICE,"Ive never been able to be with just one person. I can, however, carry on strictly physical relationships which can last for years and years. Its a shame youre married."
S02E05,GEORGE,"Umm, Im not. Its just a sociological experiment!"
S02E05,JANICE,Please...
S02E05,JERRY,You have no idea what an idiot is. Elaine just gave me a chance to get out and I didnt take it. (pointing to himself) This is an idiot.
S02E05,GEORGE,"Is that right? I just threw away a lifetime of guilt-free sex, and floor seats for ever sporting event in Madison Square Garden. So please, a little respect. For I am Costanza Lord of the Idiots!"
S02E05,ROXANNE,(yelling out the window) Youre all winners!
S02E05,GEORGE,"But suddenly, a new contender has emerged..."
S02E05,JERRY,"George, I didnt sleep at all last night. I decided I have to tell her. Im just going to be honest. Thats all... Yes, Im nervous... Are you listening to me?... Just put some soap on your finger. Itll slide right off... Then try axle grease... (Kramer enters; to the phone) Ill call you back after I talk to her... Bye."
S02E05,KRAMER,"Well, its all taken care of. Everythings cool."
S02E05,JERRY,What? Whats cool?
S02E05,KRAMER,Elaine.
S02E05,JERRY,What are you talking about?
S02E05,KRAMER,I just found a guy whos willing to pay ten thousand dollars for the apartment.
S02E05,JERRY,You what?! Get out! (pushes Kramer) Ten thousand?
S02E05,KRAMER,Cash.
S02E05,JERRY,Who would pay that much?
S02E05,KRAMER,Hes in the music business.
S02E05,JERRY,"Elaine would never borrow that much money! (Jerry hugs Kramer, then grabs him by the cheeks.) Kramer, my God, man! This is beautiful! I think Im in the clear here. Elaines not moving in. I dont have to confront her. She has no idea I never wanted her to move in. Im golden!"
S02E05,KRAMER,"Well, occasionally I like to help the humans."
S02E05,ELAINE,Wow. Youre right. That is loud.
S02E05,JERRY,Its just unbelievable.
S02E05,ELAINE,They rehearse all the time?
S02E05,JERRY,All the time. Ive been up there six times. They refuse to stop. I cant live like this. I dont know what Im gonna do. Im heading for breakdown! (to Harold) Cant you do something?
S02E05,HAROLD,Im not going up. It stinks up there.
S02E05,JERRY,Manny...
S02E05,MANNY,(in Spanish) Theyre allowed to play until eleven oclock!
S02E05,HAROLD,Im not the one who said eleven oclock. He makes up his own rules.
S02E05,ELAINE,"Boy, too bad. If I was up there, youd never hear a peep out of me. Im as quiet as a mouse."
S02E05,KRAMER,"Oh, I love the one they do right after this one! (Starts dancing)"
S02E05,JERRY,"I dont know. What do you do when a neighbor is making, like, a lot of noise at three oclock in the morning? I mean, can you knock on someones door and tell them to keep it down? Youre really altering your whole self-image. I mean, what am I, Fred Mertz now? Whats happening to me? Can I do this? Am I a shusher? I used to be a shushee. Theres a lot of shushing going on in movie theaters. People are always shushing. Shh... shh... shhh... shhh... Doesnt work, cause nobody knows where a shush is coming from. They just hear a shh. Was that a shush? I think somebody just shushed me. Some people you cant shush in a movie theater. Theres always that certain group of people, isnt it? Theyre talking and talking, and everyone around them is shushing them, and shushing them. They wont shush. Theyre the unshushables."
S02E06,JERRY,"I have to tell you that I did some very exciting news recently, and I dont know if I should really tell you exactly what it is because its really not a definite thing yet. (crowd cheers him on to tell them) Well, I will tell you what I know so far. According to the information that I have in the envelope that Ive received, it seems that I may have already won some very valuable prizes. (audience applauds) Well, thank you, thank you very much, well thank you. That's very nice to hear that. But, in all honesty, I have to say, I didnt even know I was in this thing. But, according to the readout, it looks like I am among the top people that they are considering. You know, thats what annoys me about the sweepstakes companies, they always tease you with that, You may have already won. Id like once for a sweepstakes company to have some guts, come out with the truth, just tell people the truth one time. Send out envelopes, You have definitely lost! You turn it over, giant printing, Not even close! You open it up, theres this whole letter of explanation, Even we cannot believe how badly you have done in this contest."
S02E06,JERRY,(to Kramer) To the right.
S02E06,GEORGE,That took awhile.
S02E06,JERRY,Dont get up.
S02E06,GEORGE,"Id like to help, but my neck.."
S02E06,GEORGE,So how long has it been in the basement?
S02E06,JERRY,"Since my grandfather died. I was suppose to send it down to my parents in Florida, but they didnt want it. They told me to get rid of it, but I felt funny and then I sort of forgot about it. And its been sitting down there for three years until he saw it. (to Kramer) All right, so, just take what you want and lets get it out of here."
S02E06,GEORGE,Whats in it?
S02E06,JERRY,"Grandpa clothes, I cant wear em."
S02E06,KRAMER,You want these? Knee socks. You dont wear knee socks.
S02E06,JERRY,"No, go ahead. Look at this place. I cant wait to get it cleaned."
S02E06,GEORGE,I know someone wholl do it. Shes good. Shes honest.
S02E06,JERRY,"No, Elaines got this writer friend from Finland, Rava. Her boyfriend goes to Columbia grad school, and hes suppose to do it."
S02E06,GEORGE,Students cant clean. Its anathema. (explaining) They dont like it.
S02E06,JERRY,How long have you been waiting to squeeze that into a conversation?
S02E06,KRAMER,Now this I like.
S02E06,GEORGE,Wait a second. (George gets up and heads for the statue in Kramers hands.) I cant believe this! Let me see this.
S02E06,KRAMER,"Wait, wait, wait..."
S02E06,GEORGE,Let me just see it.
S02E06,KRAMER,Come on...
S02E06,GEORGE,Let me just see it for a second.
S02E06,GEORGE,"Oh my God, its exactly the same!"
S02E06,JERRY,What?
S02E06,GEORGE,"When I was ten years old, my parents had this very same statue on the mantle of our apartment. Exactly. And, one day, I grabbed it, and I was using it as a microphone. I was singing, MacArthur Park, and I got to the part about, Ill never have that recipe again, and it slipped out of my hand and it broke. My parents looked at me like I smashed the ten commandments. To this day, they bring it up. It was the single most damaging experience in my life, aside from seeing my father naked."
S02E06,KRAMER,"Cmon, George. I saw it first."
S02E06,GEORGE,"No, Kramer. I have to have this statue."
S02E06,KRAMER,"No, I got dibs!"
S02E06,GEORGE,"What? No dibs! I need this statue. Cmon, give it!"
S02E06,JERRY,"Spread out, spread out you numbskulls. Why dont you just settle it like mature adults?"
S02E06,KRAMER,Potato man!
S02E06,GEORGE,"No, no, no potato man. Inka-dink."
S02E06,KRAMER,Okay...yea well uh start with me.
S02E06,GEORGE,"Yeah, good, good."
S02E06,JERRY,"Inka-dink, a bottle of ink, the cork fell out, and you stink."
S02E06,JERRY,"Not because youre dirty, not because youre clean  just because you kissed the girl behind the magazine..."
S02E06,JERRY,And you are it!
S02E06,KRAMER,"What?! Wait a minute. No, no, no. What are you doing? No, no, oh, oh, okay. Hes out. I get it."
S02E06,GEORGE,"No, no, no, no, Im It. I win."
S02E06,JERRY,"No, hes It. He wins. It is good."
S02E06,KRAMER,Do over  start with him.
S02E06,JERRY,"No, no, no, come on, Kramer. Now, you got the socks."
S02E06,KRAMER,"All right, you can have it. (Kramer tosses the statue to George.)"
S02E06,GEORGE,(not expecting the statue to be thrown) Dit.
S02E06,KRAMER,"Okay, Im gonna take the suit, and the shoes, and the hat."
S02E06,JERRY,"All right, cmon. Lets go."
S02E06,KRAMER,"Hey, I look like Joe Friday in Dragnet."
S02E06,GEORGE,I cant believe I won at Inka-dink.
S02E06,JERRY,"Come on, lets go."
S02E06,GEORGE,Yea.
S02E06,JERRY,Arent you gonna take it?
S02E06,GEORGE,"No, no, no, I dont want to carry it around all night. Ill pick it up later."
S02E06,GEORGE,(to Kramer) What about your stuff?
S02E06,KRAMER,"Oh, uh, well - okay."
S02E06,JERRY,"All right, lets go. Hey, you know, you owe me one."
S02E06,GEORGE,What?
S02E06,JERRY,The Inka-dink.. You were It.
S02E06,GEORGE,Its bad?
S02E06,JERRY,Its very bad.
S02E06,RAVA,"Well, if they dont let you be my editor on this book, Ill go to another publisher. Its that simple."
S02E06,ELAINE,You told them that?
S02E06,RAVA,Of course.
S02E06,ELAINE,(excited) This is so fantastic. I dont know how to thank you.
S02E06,JERRY,"(to Rava) So, wheres this boyfriend of yours? I cant wait much longer. Ive got a flight."
S02E06,ELAINE,"Oh, probably caught in traffic."
S02E06,RAVA,Or maybe hes dead.
S02E06,JERRY,"So what do you write, childrens books?"
S02E06,RAVA,Thats Ray.
S02E06,RAY,"Ah, greetings, greetings, and salutations. I beg your forgiveness. My tardiness was unavoidable. Rava, my love. Elaine, my dear friend. And you must be Jerry. Lord of the manor. Ah, my liege. A pleasure to serve you."
S02E06,JERRY,All right...
S02E06,RAVA,And we have to get back to work.
S02E06,JERRY,I gotta get to the airport.
S02E06,RAY,"Your palace shall sparkle like the stars in heaven upon your save arrival, Sire."
S02E06,JERRY,The uh toilet brush is under the sink.
S02E06,JERRY,"I dont really feel that comfortable with a maid, either, because theres that guilt when you have someone cleaning your house. You know, youre sitting there on your sofa, and they go by with the vacuum, Im really sorry about this. I dont know why I left that stuff over there. And thats why I could never be a maid, because Id have an attitude. Id find them, wherever they are in the house, Oh, I suppose you couldnt do this? No, dont get up, let me clean up your filth. No, you couldnt dust. No, this is too tough, isnt it?"
S02E06,JERRY,"He really did an amazing job. Look! He uncoagulated the top of the dishwashing liquid! (Jerry opens refrigerator.) He cleaned out the bottom of the little egg cups! Come here, look at this. (He gets on his knees and points.) He cleaned the little one-inch area between the refrigerator and the counter. How did he get in there?! He must be like Rubber Man!"
S02E06,ELAINE,Theres no Rubber Man.
S02E06,JERRY,Why did I think there was a Rubber Man? Theres Elastic Man... Plastic Man...
S02E06,ELAINE,Im leaving.
S02E06,JERRY,Where are you going?
S02E06,ELAINE,To Ravas house. Ive gotta pick up her manuscript.
S02E06,JERRY,Oh wait. Ill go with you.
S02E06,JERRY,"Elaine, he Windexed the little peep hole!"
S02E06,ELAINE,"(to Rava) So, the meeting with Lippman is all set. Hes the editor-in-chief! I think because of your request-"
S02E06,RAVA,Demand.
S02E06,ELAINE,They're going to promote me to editor.
S02E06,RAVA,Daantotin. (There is a sound of the front door being unlocked.) Theres Ray... late as usual.
S02E06,RAY,"Well, this is an unexpected surprise  and delight! The once and future king of comedy, Jerry the First, gracing our humble abode. Rava, were in the presence of royalty."
S02E06,JERRY,"Hey, Ray, listen, you really did a tremendous job cleaning that apartment."
S02E06,RAY,"But I didnt just clean your apartment. It was a ritual, a ceremony, a celebration of life."
S02E06,JERRY,Shouldnt you be out on a ledge somewhere?
S02E06,RAVA,The water is boiling. Are you having tea?
S02E06,ELAINE & RAY,Yes.
S02E06,ELAINE,Jerry? Jerry!
S02E06,JERRY,What?
S02E06,RAVA,"(from the kitchen) Ray, would you give me a hand?"
S02E06,RAY,"Yeah, Im coming!"
S02E06,JERRY,I think thats the statue from my house. That looks like the statue from my house!
S02E06,ELAINE,What statue?
S02E06,JERRY,I had a statue!
S02E06,ELAINE,You have a statue? I never saw a statue.
S02E06,JERRY,My grandfather gave me a statue!
S02E06,ELAINE,Since when?
S02E06,JERRY,Whats the difference?! Thats the one! He ripped me off! This guy ripped me off!
S02E06,RAY,Do you take sugar?
S02E06,JERRY & ELAINE,Uhh... no.
S02E06,JERRY,I cant believe it! This guy ripped me off!
S02E06,ELAINE,Do you realize what youre saying?
S02E06,JERRY,Yes! This guy ripped me off! He stole that statue right out of my house!
S02E06,RAY,Lemon?
S02E06,JERRY & ELAINE,Uh... sure/yeah..
S02E06,ELAINE,Are you sure?
S02E06,JERRY,Pretty sure! Ninety-nine percent sure.
S02E06,ELAINE,Ninety-nine percent sure?!
S02E06,RAY,"Ah, sweet elixir. Its fragrant nectar a soothing balm for the soul."
S02E06,RAVA,"Ah those are the pastries, Ray take care of that, I'm going to get Elaine the manuscript."
S02E06,RAY,"Ah, the pastries!"
S02E06,ELAINE,Maybe it just looks the same. Maybe its just a coincidence.
S02E06,JERRY,"Coincidence? This guys in my apartment and then, just by coincidence, he has the same exact statue in his apartment?"
S02E06,ELAINE,I never saw the statue.
S02E06,JERRY,I had a statue! What should I do?
S02E06,ELAINE,I dont know.
S02E06,JERRY,Ill call Kramer. He can check my house.
S02E06,ELAINE,"Oh Jerry, dont blow this for me."
S02E06,JERRY,"Dont worry. (whispering into the phone) Kramer! Kramer!... Its Jerry!... Jerry!... From next door!... Never mind where I am!... Yes, Jerry Seinfeld!..."
S02E06,JERRY,"Ma, I told you, just dip the bread in the batter, and put in right in the pan... Okay, bye. (Jerry hangs up; to Rava) My mother. She forgot how to make French toast. You know how mothers are."
S02E06,RAVA,My mother left us when I was six years old. All seven of us. We never heard from her again. I hope shes rotting in an alley somewhere!
S02E06,JERRY,My moms down in Florida. Shes got uh one of those condos. Hot down there in the summer. You ever been down there?
S02E06,RAY,"I love these pastries. You know, in Scandinavian mythology, the pastries were the food of the gods."
S02E06,JERRY,"Listen, uh I just remembered... Im... uh, getting a facial."
S02E06,ELAINE,"Oh, see you tomorrow morning."
S02E06,RAY,How about dinner?
S02E06,JERRY,"No, I dont eat dinner. Dinners for suckers."
S02E06,JERRY,"Uh huh... Yeah... Okay, thanks anyway... Bye."
S02E06,JERRY,"Nope, the cop says its my word against his. Theres nothing they can do."
S02E06,KRAMER,Lets go get him.
S02E06,JERRY,"Yeah, right."
S02E06,GEORGE,We cant just let him get away with this.
S02E06,JERRY,"Do you realize how crazy he had to be to do something like this? He knew I was gonna know its missing, and he took it! And of all things to take! I left my watch, tape recorder, stereo. Hes crazy."
S02E06,KRAMER,You wanna go get him?
S02E06,ELAINE,"Well, then, if hes crazy you should just forget it."
S02E06,GEORGE,Forget it? I already called my parents. I told them to expect the surprise of a lifetime. My mothers making her roasted potatoes!
S02E06,ELAINE,"George, do you realize that Rava has asked me to edit her book?"
S02E06,GEORGE,Who is this Rava?
S02E06,KRAMER,I say we get him.
S02E06,ELAINE,No!
S02E06,GEORGE,Let me just call him.
S02E06,JERRY,"Ill call him. (Jerry picks up the cordless phone. He points to the rotary phone on the coffee table. Kramer, George, and Elaine struggle for it.) Hello, Ray?... Hi, Ray, this is Ravas friend, Elaines friend, Jerry... The King of Comedy, right. Listen, you know that statue on your mantle, the one with the blue lady? (He covers the reciever and yells at Kramer and George.) Would you shut up?! (to the phone) Yeah, you dont want to talk about it over the phone?.. You dont want Rava to hear?... Yeah, I understand... You know that coffee shop near my house, Monks?... All right, tomorrow... One o clock... Great, okay, bye."
S02E06,ELAINE,"All right, look, look, look. Lets say he stole it."
S02E06,GEORGE,"Oh, he stole it!"
S02E06,ELAINE,"Cmon, you cant do anything about it. The cops wont do anything. What, are you going to fight him? Why dont you just forget it?"
S02E06,JERRY & GEORGE,No.
S02E06,GEORGE,I thought you said one oclock.
S02E06,JERRY,"Relax, hes late. Hes always late. Its part of his M.O."
S02E06,GEORGE,"Remember, dont take any crap."
S02E06,JERRY,"Yeah, yeah. Dont worry about it."
S02E06,GEORGE,Ill be right here.
S02E06,JERRY,Thats comforting. Shh. Hes coming. (to Ray) Ray?
S02E06,RAY,"Oh, Jerry. I cant believe you asked me about that statue. Do you know how much trouble you couldve got me into?"
S02E06,JERRY,"Well, I didnt..."
S02E06,RAY,Rava was standing right next to me. I never told her where I got the statue.
S02E06,GEORGE,(muttering to himself) I wonder why.
S02E06,JERRY,"Well, just give it back, and I wont say anything."
S02E06,RAY,Give it back?
S02E06,JERRY,Yeah.
S02E06,RAY,What are you talking about?
S02E06,JERRY,What are you talking about?
S02E06,GEORGE,What is he talking about?
S02E06,RAY,Im talking about the statue.
S02E06,JERRY,"Yeah, me too."
S02E06,RAY,Give it back to whom?
S02E06,JERRY,Me.
S02E06,GEORGE,"Yeah, him."
S02E06,RAY,You?
S02E06,JERRY,Yeah. Me.
S02E06,RAY,Im not getting this.
S02E06,GEORGE,You already got it.
S02E06,JERRY,"Ray, I had a statue in my house. You were in my house  and then I saw it in your house."
S02E06,RAY,What are you saying?
S02E06,JERRY,What am I saying?
S02E06,GEORGE,Take a wild guess.
S02E06,RAY,Are you saying I stole your statue?
S02E06,GEORGE,What a mind.
S02E06,JERRY,"Well, I..."
S02E06,RAY,I cant believe what Im hearing.
S02E06,JERRY,I cant believe what Im hearing.
S02E06,GEORGE,I cant believe what Im hearing.
S02E06,RAY,"For your information, I got that statue in a pawn shop."
S02E06,GEORGE,Pawn shop?
S02E06,JERRY,A pawn shop?
S02E06,RAY,Yes. In Chinatown with the money I earned cleaning peoples apartments.
S02E06,GEORGE,Cleaning them out.
S02E06,JERRY,"Oh, excuse me... Look, Ray, you were the only person in my house."
S02E06,RAY,"Whats behind this? Its Rava, isnt it?"
S02E06,GEORGE,Again with the Rava.
S02E06,RAY,You want her.
S02E06,JERRY,"No, shes a little too cheery for me."
S02E06,RAY,"Shes from Finland, for crying out loud. Finland! Do you understand?!"
S02E06,JERRY,I know Finland. Theyre neutral.
S02E06,RAY,Is it me? Do I rub you the wrong way?
S02E06,JERRY,"No, I actually find you quite charming. A bit verbose at times..."
S02E06,GEORGE,"Oh, I find you so charming. You wuss."
S02E06,JERRY,(to George) Did you call me a wuss?
S02E06,RAY,What did you say?
S02E06,JERRY,I said luss. Im at a luss.
S02E06,RAY,I would just love to take you down to the shop where I got it.
S02E06,JERRY,"Thats not necessary. (George slams his menu down on the table repeatedly.) You know, maybe its not that bad an idea."
S02E06,RAY,"And I would love to. Nothing would please me more. But, unfortunately, the guy retired and moved to Singapore."
S02E06,GEORGE,Singapore?! Do you hear this?
S02E06,RAY,"If you really want, maybe I can contact the guy in Singapore and have him make a photostat of the receipt and send it over."
S02E06,GEORGE,Thats it! Thats it! I cant take it. I cant take it anymore! You stole the statue! Youre a theif! Youre a liar!
S02E06,JERRY,George...
S02E06,RAY,Who is this?
S02E06,GEORGE,"Im the judge and the jury, pal. And the verdict is guilty!"
S02E06,RAY,Whats going on here?
S02E06,GEORGE,GUILTY!
S02E06,RAY,Your friend is crazy.
S02E06,GEORGE,"Oh, Im crazy!"
S02E06,JERRY,"George, george..."
S02E06,RAY,Ive got to get going. I have a class.
S02E06,GEORGE,"Oh ho! Class, huh? At Columbia? Let me tell you something, pal. I called the registrars office. I checked you out. They have no record of a Ray Thomas at that school! You liar!"
S02E06,RAY,"Well, thats because Im registered under my full legal name, Raymond Thomas Wochinski. Ray Thomas is my professional name."
S02E06,GEORGE,You mean alias.
S02E06,RAY,You are starting to make me angry!
S02E06,GEORGE,"Well, that was bound to happen."
S02E06,RAY,"(to Jerry) I hope you think about what youve done here today. And if you want to call and apologize, you know where to reach me."
S02E06,JERRY,"Hey, Ray."
S02E06,RAY,Yes?
S02E06,JERRY,How did you get the goop out of the top of the dishwashing liquid? It was like a brand-new nozzle!
S02E06,ELAINE,Nervous?
S02E06,RAVA,Why should I be?
S02E06,ELAINE,Yeah. Right.
S02E06,RAVA,Your notes are very insightful.
S02E06,ELAINE,The book is great. Did you go out last night?
S02E06,RAVA,No. We made love on the floor like two animals. Ray is insatiable.
S02E06,ELAINE,They all are.
S02E06,RAVA,Was Jerry?
S02E06,ELAINE,I cant remember.
S02E06,RAVA,"You know, Ray is very upset over these accusations."
S02E06,ELAINE,"Oh, well, Im staying out of this one. This is between them. I am not getting involved."
S02E06,RAVA,So you think he stole it?!
S02E06,ELAINE,"Well, you have to admit... the circumstantial evidence..."
S02E06,RAVA,I admit nothing!
S02E06,MAN,"Will you put that cigarette out, please?"
S02E06,ELAINE,"Well, I mean, he was in the apartment, and then its gone and its in your apartment."
S02E06,RAVA,Maybe you think were in cahoots.
S02E06,ELAINE,"No, no. But it is quite a coincidence."
S02E06,RAVA,"Yes, thats all a coincidence!"
S02E06,ELAINE,A big coincidence.
S02E06,RAVA,Not a big coincidence. A coincidence!
S02E06,ELAINE,"No, thats a big coincidence."
S02E06,RAVA,Thats what a coincidence is! There are no small coincidences and big coincidences!
S02E06,ELAINE,"No, there are degrees of coincidences."
S02E06,RAVA,"No, there are only coincidences! Ask anyone!"
S02E06,RAVA,"Are there big coincidences and small coincidences, or just coincidences? Well?! Well?!"
S02E06,MAN,Will you put that cigarette out?!
S02E06,RAVA,Maybe I put it out on your face! (To Elaine) Its just like Ray said. You and Jerry are jealous of our love. Youre trying to destroy us.
S02E06,ELAINE,Shouldnt you be out on a ledge somewhere?
S02E06,GEORGE,"Ma, will you stop?... Its just a statue!... How is it my fault?!... It was stolen. I didnt even touch it this time... Okay, fine... I dont see why this should affect to potatoes!... Okay... Goodbye. (George hangs up.) She doesnt react to disappointment very well. Unlike me."
S02E06,KRAMER,Im not happy about this.
S02E06,ELAINE,Why dont we just throw a Molotov cocktail through their window?
S02E06,GEORGE,"Theres just no justice. This experience has changed me. Its made me more cynical, more bitter, more jaded."
S02E06,JERRY,Really?
S02E06,GEORGE,"(casually) Sure, why not."
S02E06,ELAINE,"Well, how do you think I feel? Instead of editing the first novel of a major young writing talent, I am proofreading a food allergy cookbook."
S02E06,JERRY,Cant you talk to your boss?
S02E06,ELAINE,"I did. He loves Rava. Worse, he loves Ray. And he didn't think youre funny at all."
S02E06,KRAMER,(talking to himself) Im not happy about this.
S02E06,JERRY,"Well, perhaps we can take comfort in the knowledge that in the next world, Ray will be the recipient of a much larger and more harsh brand of justice.."
S02E06,GEORGE,"Yeah, hell have my parents."
S02E06,KRAMER,(from the other side of the door) Police! Open up!
S02E06,RAY,Police?
S02E06,KRAMER,"Freeze, mother!"
S02E06,RAY,Hey.
S02E06,KRAMER,"Shut up. Spread em. I said spread em! (looks around) Youre in big trouble son. Burglary, grand larceny, possession of stolen goods... and uh, uh... murder."
S02E06,RAY,Murder?!
S02E06,KRAMER,"Shut up! Keep em spread! Just make love to that wall, pervert!"
S02E06,RAY,I think you have me confused with somebody else.
S02E06,KRAMER,Is your name Ray?
S02E06,RAY,Yeah.
S02E06,KRAMER,"Yeah, youre the punk Im looking for!"
S02E06,RAY,"Hey, hey, are you a cop?"
S02E06,KRAMER,"Yeah, Im a cop. Im a good cop. Im a damn good cop! (On that line, Kramer points to Ray, and Ray turns back to the wall. Kramer heads for the door.) Todays your lucky day, junior, cause Im gonna let you off with a warning. Any more of this criminal activity, and youll be sorry. You got me?"
S02E06,RAY,Got you? I dont even know what the hell youre talking about.
S02E06,KRAMER,"Good, good. Lets uh keep it that way."
S02E06,JERRY,"All right, all right. Whats the big hubbub, bub?"
S02E06,GEORGE,"Kramer, I cant believe it. Oh, youre my hero!"
S02E06,KRAMER,Yeah.
S02E06,JERRY,"Kramer, what did you do?"
S02E06,KRAMER,"Well, lets just say I didnt take him to Peoples Court."
S02E06,GEORGE,"I feel like a huge weights been lifted off my shoulders. I... I... I feel happy! Kramer, I dont know how to thank you!"
S02E06,KRAMER,"Well, Ill think of something."
S02E06,JERRY,"People are going to steal from you. You cant stop them. But, everybody has their own little personal security things. Things that they think will foil the crooks, you know? In your own mind, right? You go to the beach, go in the water, put your wallet in the sneaker, whos gonna know? What criminal mind could penetrate this fortress of security? I tied a bow. They cant get through that. I put the wallet down by the toe of the sneaker. They never look there. They check the heel, they move on."
S02E07,JERRY,"Whenever I see the news and they're hauling in some kind of terrorist, psycho, maniac, mass murderer guy. You notice he's always covering up his face with the newspaper, with the jacket, with the hat. What is he worried about? I mean what is this man's reputation? That he has to worry about this kind of exposure damaging his good name? I mean, what is he up for a big job promotion down at the office or something? Afraid the boss is gonna catch this on TV and go ""isn't that Johnson from sales? He's up in that clock tower picking people off one by one. I don't know if that's that kind of man we want heading up that new branch office. He should be in bill collection. I think he's got aptitude."""
S02E07,LEVITAN,"(on the phone) Ha ha, she was great. You don't want to know. Hey Breaky, remind me to tell you what we did in Lake George. (laughing) Get this...I got it all on video. (laughing)"
S02E07,GEORGE,"That's it. This is it. I'm done. Through. It's over. I'm gone. Finished. Over. I will never work for you again. Look at you. (laughing) You think you're an important man? Is that what you think? You are a laughingstock. You are a joke. These people are laughing at you. You're nothing! You have no brains, no ability, nothing! (knocking object over on desk) I quit!"
S02E07,KRAMER,Hey.
S02E07,JERRY,Hey.
S02E07,KRAMER,"Boy, I have really had it with Newman. He wakes me up again last night at three o'clock in the morning to tell me he's going up onto the roof to kill himself."
S02E07,JERRY,"Well, what'd you say?"
S02E07,KRAMER,"I said "" Jump."" Well, he's been threatening to do this for years. I said "" Look, if you're gonna kill yourself do it already and stop bothering me."" At least I'd respect the guy for accomplishing something."
S02E07,JERRY,What's his problem?
S02E07,KRAMER,No job. No women.
S02E07,JERRY,He called the right guy.
S02E07,KRAMER,"Well, what am I supposed to tell him? How much there is for him to live for? Why should I lie to him?"
S02E07,JERRY,"All right, I'm leaving. I going to the laundry."
S02E07,KRAMER,Why don't you use the machines down in the basement?
S02E07,JERRY,Fluff and Fold. The only way to live. (snapping fingers in tune with words) I drop it off. I pick it up. It's a delight.
S02E07,KRAMER,How 'bout if I put a few things --
S02E07,JERRY,Wait a sec. I don't wanna do --
S02E07,KRAMER,"Well, you're going over there."
S02E07,JERRY,I don't wanna mix in everything! My guys don't know your guys. You can't just lock 'em all in the same machine together. They'll start a riot.
S02E07,KRAMER,Have you ever met my guys?
S02E07,JERRY,No. I can't say as I have.
S02E07,KRAMER,Well!
S02E07,JERRY,All right. Put 'em on top.
S02E07,KRAMER,Ah!
S02E07,JERRY,"Oh, beautiful."
S02E07,JERRY,This stuff on top is my friends. Could I get it done in a separate machine?
S02E07,VIC,I'll have to charge you for another machine.
S02E07,JERRY,"Whatever it costs. In fact, I would prefer it if the machines are not even touching each other. Because something could, you know, jump across."
S02E07,GEORGE,Guess what.
S02E07,JERRY,How did you know I was here?
S02E07,GEORGE,Kramer. Guess what.
S02E07,JERRY,I don't know.
S02E07,GEORGE,I quit my job.
S02E07,JERRY,Get outta here.
S02E07,GEORGE,I couldn't take it anymore.
S02E07,VIC,You can have this on Monday. (hands Jerry a ticket)
S02E07,JERRY,What happened? Levitan?
S02E07,GEORGE,"I go in to use his private bathroom, everybody uses it, and then I get a memo - a memo - telling me to use the men's room in the hall. Well, (laughing) I mean we share it with Pace Electronics. It's disgusting!"
S02E07,JERRY,You and your toilets.
S02E07,GEORGE,I snapped! It was the last straw. (sighs)
S02E07,JERRY,"So, what are you gonna do now? Are you gonna look for something else in real estate?"
S02E07,GEORGE,Nobody's hiring now. The market's terrible.
S02E07,JERRY,So what are you gonna do?
S02E07,GEORGE,I like sports. I could do something in sports.
S02E07,JERRY,Uh-huh. Uh-huh. In what capacity?
S02E07,GEORGE,"You know, like the general manager of a baseball team or something."
S02E07,JERRY,"Yeah. Well, that - that could be tough to get."
S02E07,GEORGE,"Well, it doesn't even have to be the general manager. Maybe I could be like, an announcer. Like a color man. You know how I always make those interesting comments during the game."
S02E07,JERRY,Yeah. Yeah. You make good comments.
S02E07,GEORGE,What about that?
S02E07,JERRY,"Well, they tend to give those jobs to ex-ballplayers and people that are, you know, in broadcasting."
S02E07,GEORGE,"Well, that's really not fair."
S02E07,JERRY,"I know. Well, okay. Okay. What else do ya like?"
S02E07,GEORGE,Movies. I like to watch movies.
S02E07,JERRY,Yeah. Yeah.
S02E07,GEORGE,Do they pay people to watch movies?
S02E07,JERRY,Projectionists.
S02E07,GEORGE,That's true.
S02E07,JERRY,But you gotta know how to work the projector.
S02E07,GEORGE,Right.
S02E07,JERRY,And it's probably a union thing.
S02E07,GEORGE,"(scoffs) Those unions. (sighs) Okay. Sports,...movies. What about a talk show host?"
S02E07,JERRY,Talk show host. That's good.
S02E07,GEORGE,I think I'd be good at that. I talk to people all the time. Someone even told me once they thought I'd be a good talk show host.
S02E07,JERRY,Really?
S02E07,GEORGE,"Yeah. A couple of people. I don't get that, though. Where do you start?"
S02E07,JERRY,"Well, that's where it gets tricky."
S02E07,GEORGE,"You can't just walk into a building and say "" I wanna be a talk show host."""
S02E07,JERRY,I wouldn't think so.
S02E07,GEORGE,It's all politics.
S02E07,JERRY,"All right. Okay. Sports, movies, talk show host. What else?"
S02E07,GEORGE,This could have been a huge mistake.
S02E07,JERRY,"Well, it doesn't sound like you completely thought this through."
S02E07,GEORGE,(sighs) Guess not. What should I do?
S02E07,JERRY,Maybe you can just go back.
S02E07,GEORGE,Go back?
S02E07,JERRY,Yeah. Pretend like it never happened.
S02E07,GEORGE,You mean just walk into the staff meeting on Monday morning like it never happened?
S02E07,JERRY,Sure. You're an emotional person. People don't take you seriously.
S02E07,GEORGE,Just..go back. Pretend the whole thing never happened.
S02E07,JERRY,Never happened.
S02E07,GEORGE,I was just blowin' off a little steam. So what?
S02E07,JERRY,So what? You're entitled.
S02E07,GEORGE,I'm emotional.
S02E07,JERRY,That's right. You're emotional.
S02E07,GEORGE,Never happened.
S02E07,JERRY,Never happened.
S02E07,JERRY,"To me the most annoying thing about the couple of times that I did work in an office. Is that when you go in, in the morning you say Hi to everyone and for some reason throughout the day you have to continue to greet these people all day every time you see them. I mean you walk in ""morning Bill, morning Bob, how you doing? fine"" Ten minutes later you see him in the hall, ""How ya doin'?"" Every time you pass you gotta come up with another little greeting. You know you start racking your brains you know you do the little eyebrow ""Hey"" You start coming up with nicknames for them. ""Jimbo."""
S02E07,GEORGE,How ya doin'?
S02E07,GLENDA,What are you doing here?
S02E07,GEORGE,What? I work here.
S02E07,GLENDA,I thought you quit.
S02E07,GEORGE,What quit? (laughing) Who quit?
S02E07,DAN,"Bill, how was your weekend?"
S02E07,BILL,"Oh, excellent weekend. What about your weekend?"
S02E07,DAN,Fine weekend.
S02E07,GEORGE,Yeah. Good weekend.
S02E07,DAN,"Went up to the Cape. Took the kids sailing. (laughing) Lisa was a little scared at first, but that kids' gonna be a good sailor someday."
S02E07,GEORGE,"Aw, she's gonna be a fine sailor."
S02E07,LEVITAN,"Ava, what happened to you Friday afternoon?"
S02E07,AVA,"Oh, I got a little tied up."
S02E07,LEVITAN,I'll bet you did.
S02E07,LEVITAN,"I wanna remind everyone that the tenth anniversary party for Rick Barr Properties is gonna be Wednesday afternoon at four o'clock in Lasky's Bar, on Madison 48th. I want all of you to be there. This really means a lot to me. Is that Costanza over there? What are you doing here?"
S02E07,GEORGE,What?
S02E07,LEVITAN,"Am I crazy, or didn't you quit?"
S02E07,GEORGE,When?
S02E07,LEVITAN,Friday.
S02E07,GEORGE,"Oh, what? What? That? Are you kidding? I didn't quit. What? You took that seriously?"
S02E07,LEVITAN,"You mean, laughingstock? All that stuff?"
S02E07,GEORGE,Come on. Will you stop it.
S02E07,LEVITAN,No brains? No ability?
S02E07,GEORGE,Teasing.
S02E07,LEVITAN,Okay. I want you outta here.
S02E07,GEORGE,"I don't know where you're getting this from. I....you're serious aren't you? Oh, (laughing) you see? You see, you just don't know my sense of humor. Dan, don't I joke around all the time?"
S02E07,DAN,I wouldn't say all the time.
S02E07,LEVITAN,You can't win. You can't beat me. That's why I'm here and you're there. Because I'm a winner. I'll always be a winner and you'll always be a loser.
S02E07,GEORGE,""" I'll always be a winner and you'll always be a loser."" This is what he said to me."
S02E07,JERRY,"Well, so that's that."
S02E07,GEORGE,No. That's not that.
S02E07,JERRY,That's not that?
S02E07,GEORGE,No.
S02E07,JERRY,"Well, if that's not that, what is that?"
S02E07,GEORGE,I've got some plans. I got plans.
S02E07,JERRY,What kind of plans?
S02E07,GEORGE,What's the difference?
S02E07,JERRY,You don't wanna tell me?
S02E07,GEORGE,I'm gonna slip him a mickey.
S02E07,JERRY,What? In his drink? Are you outta your mind? What are you Peter Lorre?
S02E07,GEORGE,You don't understand. He's got this big party coming up. He's been looking forward to this for months. This is gonna destroy the whole thing.
S02E07,JERRY,What if you destroy him?
S02E07,GEORGE,No. No. No. No. No. Don't worry. It's perfectly safe. I researched it. He'll get a little woozy. He might keel over.
S02E07,JERRY,"Well, wha - what does that do? Big deal."
S02E07,GEORGE,This is what they would do in the movies! It's a beautiful thing! It's like a movie! I'm gonna slip him a mickey!
S02E07,JERRY,You've really gone mental.
S02E07,GEORGE,Nah.
S02E07,JERRY,"Where are you gonna get this mickey? I can't believe I'm saying ""mickey""!"
S02E07,GEORGE,I got a source.
S02E07,JERRY,You got a mickey source?
S02E07,GEORGE,And Elaine is gonna keep him busy.
S02E07,JERRY,Elaine? How did you rope her into this?
S02E07,GEORGE,I told her what a sexist he is. How he cheats on his wife.
S02E07,JERRY,She knew that.
S02E07,GEORGE,But she didn't know he doesn't recycle.
S02E07,JERRY,What is the point of all this?
S02E07,GEORGE,Revenge.
S02E07,JERRY,"Oh, the best revenge is living well."
S02E07,GEORGE,There's no chance of that.
S02E07,JERRY,Did you get your laundry?
S02E07,KRAMER,Yeah.
S02E07,JERRY,What's with you?
S02E07,KRAMER,He jumped.
S02E07,JERRY,What?
S02E07,KRAMER,Yeah. Newman jumped.
S02E07,JERRY,Did he call you last night?
S02E07,KRAMER,"Oh, yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah."
S02E07,JERRY,What did you say?
S02E07,KRAMER,"I said "" Wave to me when you pass my window."""
S02E07,JERRY,Whew. Did he wave?
S02E07,KRAMER,"No! He jumped from the second floor. Mr. Papanickolous saw him from across the street. He's lying out there faking. See, he's trying to get back at me."
S02E07,JERRY,"(realizing something) Oh, my god!"
S02E07,KRAMER,What's the matter?
S02E07,JERRY,"(tearing through his laundry bag) Well, on Thursday when I came home I had $1500 on me. For some reason I decided to hide it in my laundry bag and then I completely forgot about it...and then I took the laundry in on Friday! Oh, come on, let's go."
S02E07,KRAMER,Where? Where?
S02E07,JERRY,To the Laundromat.
S02E07,VIC,I never saw it.
S02E07,KRAMER,Okay. Come on. Give the guy his money. What -- what are you doing?
S02E07,VIC,"Hey, you see that sign right there? (Points to a sign saying ""Not Responsible for Valuables"""
S02E07,JERRY,"Oh, I see. So, you put up a sign so you can do whatever you want? You're not a part of society."
S02E07,VIC,"Yea that's right, 'cuz this place is my country and I'm the president, and that's my constitution. I'm not responsible."
S02E07,JERRY,"So, anybody leaves anything here, you can just take it? You have a license to steal? You are like the James Bond of laundry?"
S02E07,VIC,You ever hear of a bank?
S02E07,JERRY,Come on. Let's go.
S02E07,KRAMER,No. You can't let him get away with this.
S02E07,ELAINE,Which one is he?
S02E07,GEORGE,That's him over there. The one that looks like a blowfish.
S02E07,ELAINE,"Oh, yeah. I see him."
S02E07,GEORGE,"Yeah. Hey, thanks for doing this."
S02E07,ELAINE,Why pass up the opportunity to go to prison?
S02E07,GEORGE,This is by far the most exciting thing I've ever done.
S02E07,ELAINE,Yeah. It is kind of cool.
S02E07,GEORGE,First time in my life I've ever gotten back at someone.
S02E07,ELAINE,I can't believe we're doing this. This is the kind of thing they do in the movies.
S02E07,GEORGE,That's exactly what I told Jerry!
S02E07,ELAINE,Really?
S02E07,GEORGE,"Yes! (both laugh) God, I've never felt so alive!"
S02E07,JERRY,Maybe we should call this off.
S02E07,KRAMER,Come on. What's the big deal? Just gonna put a little concrete in the washing machine.
S02E07,JERRY,And what's gonna happen?
S02E07,KRAMER,"Well, it'll gonna mix up with the water, and then by the end of the cycle it'll be a solid block!"
S02E07,JERRY,If only you could put your mind to something worthwhile. You're like Lex Luthor.
S02E07,KRAMER,You keep him busy.
S02E07,KRAMER,Whoa!
S02E07,GEORGE,You go over there -
S02E07,ELAINE,Yeah.
S02E07,GEORGE,"You start flirting with him and I'll come by and, while you're keeping him busy, I'll slip it in his drink."
S02E07,ELAINE,Wouldn't it be easier just to punch him in the mouth?
S02E07,LEVITAN,Come on! They're terrible. They got no infield.
S02E07,ELAINE,Oops! (bumps into Levitan) 'Scuse me.
S02E07,LEVITAN,Yeah.
S02E07,GREENY,I'm gonna get some food. You want some?
S02E07,LEVITAN,Nah.
S02E07,ELAINE,Hi.
S02E07,LEVITAN,Hi.
S02E07,ELAINE,(sneezes)
S02E07,LEVITAN,God bless you.
S02E07,ELAINE,"Oh! Thank you. Thank you very much. (blowing nose) Really. I mean that. I am not one of those people who give insincere thank you's. No sir. No sir. When I thank someone I really thank them. So, thank... yoooou!"
S02E07,LEVITAN,(confused) You're welcome.
S02E07,ELAINE,"People don't say "" God bless you "" as much as they used to. Have you noticed that?"
S02E07,LEVITAN,No.
S02E07,ELAINE,"(having trouble getting him to pay attention) So, I'm going to a nudist colony next week."
S02E07,LEVITAN,(interested) Nudist colony?
S02E07,ELAINE,"Oh, yeah. Yeah. I love nudist colonies. They help me..unwind. Aah!"
S02E07,LEVITAN,(laughing) I'd never been to a nudist colony.
S02E07,ELAINE,"Oh, really? Oh, you should go. They're great. They're great. Of course, when it's over, it's - it's hard to get used to all this clothing, you know. So, a lot of times, I'll just lock the door to my office and I'll just sit there naked."
S02E07,LEVITAN,Seriously?
S02E07,ELAINE,"Oh, yeah. I usually work naked a...couple hours a day."
S02E07,GEORGE,"(whispering) Glenda, can I ask you a favor? Can I have this seat?"
S02E07,GLENDA,(loud) What do you have to sit here for? There are plenty of other seats.
S02E07,GEORGE,(whispering) I can't explain. It's very important that I sit here.
S02E07,GLENDA,(loud) What are you doing here anyway? I thought you were fired.
S02E07,GEORGE,(whispering angrily) Okay. Okay. Fine.
S02E07,ELAINE,"I cook naked, I clean....I clean naked, I drive naked. Naked. Naked. Naked."
S02E07,LEVITAN,Who are you?
S02E07,ELAINE,"Oh, you don't wanna know, mistah. I'm trouble. Big trouble."
S02E07,JERRY,(trying to divert Vic's attention) What about the gentle cycle? You ever use that?
S02E07,JERRY,Do you think it's effeminate for a man to put clothes in a gentle cycle?
S02E07,JERRY,What about fine fabrics? How do you deal with that kind of temperament?
S02E07,JERRY,What about stone washing? You ever witness one of those? That must be something. What? Do they just pummel the jeans with rocks?
S02E07,KRAMER,I didn't realize it was a full box.
S02E07,GEORGE,"(trying again with Glenda) I'm gonna count to three. If you don't give up the chair, the wig is coming off."
S02E07,GLENDA,I don't' wear a wig.
S02E07,GEORGE,One... (Glenda seeing George is serious; gets up and leaves)
S02E07,ELAINE,"No. No. No. No. No. I don't really have a phone. In fact, I - I really don't have an apartment. I kinda sleep around."
S02E07,ELAINE,I just like to have and few drinks and just let the guy do whatever he wants. Would you close your eyes for a second? I wanna tell you a secret about my bra.
S02E07,GEORGE,"Hello, Rick."
S02E07,LEVITAN,Heh heh heh hey! Look who's here!
S02E07,GEORGE,"That's right, Ricky Boy, it's me!"
S02E07,LEVITAN,"You know something, Costanza? I'm a very lucky man."
S02E07,GEORGE,Oh!
S02E07,LEVITAN,I've always been lucky. Things just seem to fall right in my lap.
S02E07,GEORGE,Boom!
S02E07,LEVITAN,"You wouldn't believe it if I told you. In fact, uh, I'm glad you're here. You know, maybe I've been a little rough on ya, huh?"
S02E07,GEORGE,Oh.
S02E07,LEVITAN,"Why should we let petty, personal differences get in the way of business? I, uh, I want you to come back. (George is shocked) You can use my bathroom anytime you want."
S02E07,GEORGE,You want me to come back? Uh...
S02E07,LEVITAN,"Hey! How about a toast, huh? Everybody, a toast!"
S02E07,GEORGE,Rick.
S02E07,LEVITAN,"Everyone, I wanna propose a toast to ten great years at Rick Barr Properties."
S02E07,GEORGE,"Uh, Rick.."
S02E07,LEVITAN,"And all the people in this room, (clears throat) that made that possible.."
S02E07,GEORGE,Rick.
S02E07,LEVITAN,"I'd also like to welcome back into the fold our..our little shrimpy friend, George Costanza who, although he didn't really have a very good year -- how you blew that McConnell deal, I'll never know. But, hey, what the hell, huh? We've always enjoyed his antics around the office. Heh heh. Anything you wanna add to this?"
S02E07,GEORGE,Drink up. (Levitan takes a drink)
S02E07,GEORGE,"I like history. Civil War. Maybe I could be a professor, or something."
S02E07,ELAINE,"Well, to teach something you really have to know a lot about it. I think you need a degree."
S02E07,JERRY,Yeah. That's true.
S02E07,KRAMER,(seeing Jerry is with people) Oh.
S02E07,JERRY,"What? (Kramer hands Jerry an envelope) My God, the money! The 1500! Where'd you find it?"
S02E07,KRAMER,It was in my laundry.
S02E07,JERRY,In your laundry the whole time? I told you not to mix in our guys. What did we figure the damage on that machine would be?
S02E07,KRAMER,It was about 1200 bucks.
S02E07,NEWMAN,Kramer!
S02E07,KRAMER,Oh! That's Newman. (goes over to the window)
S02E07,NEWMAN,I'm on the roof!
S02E07,KRAMER,"(yelling up) Well, what are you waiting for?"
S02E07,JERRY,"Elaine, come on, take a walk with me down to the Laundromat. I gotta pay this guy the money.."
S02E07,GEORGE,(talking to nobody) I like horses. Maybe I could be a stable boy.
S02E07,KRAMER,You wanna shoot some pool tonight?
S02E07,NEWMAN,I can't. I'm goin' to a movie.
S02E07,GEORGE,(talking to nobody) Nah. It's probably a union thing.
S02E07,JERRY,"People like the idea of revenge. Have you ever heard the expression 'The best revenge is living well' I've said this, in other words it means supposedly the best way to get back at someone is just by being happy and successful in your own life. Sounds nice, doesn't really work on that Charles Bronson. kinda level. You know what I mean, those movies where his whole family gets wiped out by some street scum. You think you could go up to him, 'Charlie forgot about the 357 what you need is a custom-made suit and a convertible. New carpeting, french doors, a divan. That'll show those punks.'"

S02E08,JERRY,"You know, I tell ya, I gotta say that I'm enjoying adulthood. For a lot of reasons. And, I'll tell you reason number one as an adult, if I want a cookie, I have a cookie, okay? I have three cookies or four cookies, or eleven cookies if I want. Many times I will intentionally ruin my entire appetite. Just ruin it. And then, I call my mother up right after to tell her that I did it. ""Hello, Mom? yeah, I just ruined my entire appetite.. cookies."" So what if you ruin.. See, because as an adult, we understand even if you ruin an appetite, there's another appetite coming right behind it. There's no danger in running out of appetites. I've got millions of them, I'll ruin them whenever I want!"

S02E08,GEORGE,"Yeah, so what?"
S02E08,ELAINE,You're bringing in an ouside cucumber?
S02E08,GEORGE,They refuse to put cucumber in the salad. I need cucumber.
S02E08,JERRY,"(Trying to read the note) What have I done? I can't read this! Ful-hel-mo-nen-ter-val? I got up last night, I wrote this down, I thought I had this great bit."
S02E08,ELAINE,"No. Let me see that. (Takes the paper from Jerry) Don't-mess-with-Johnny."""
S02E08,JERRY,Johnny? Johnny who? Johnny Carson? Did I insult Johnny on The Tonight Show?
S02E08,ELAINE,"(Joking) Did you mess with Johnny, Jerry?"
S02E08,GEORGE,Let me see that. (Studies the note)
S02E08,ELAINE,"Hey, where's Kramer?"
S02E08,JERRY,"I don't know. That's like asking ""Where's Waldo?"""
S02E08,GEORGE,(Still holding the note) I think I'm having a heart attack.
S02E08,JERRY,I don't think that's it.
S02E08,GEORGE,I'm not kidding.
S02E08,JERRY,What does that mean?
S02E08,ELAINE,I think what he's trying to say is that he's having a heart attack.
S02E08,JERRY,"Oh, he's having a heart attack."
S02E08,GEORGE,Tightness..
S02E08,JERRY,C'mon.
S02E08,GEORGE,Shortness of breath..
S02E08,JERRY,"Oh, this is ridiculous."
S02E08,GEORGE,Radiating waves of pain..
S02E08,JERRY,"I know what this is. You saw that show on PBS last night, Coronary Country. (To Elaine) I saw it in the TV Guide. I called him and told him to make sure and not watch it."
S02E08,GEORGE,"There was nothing else on. Oh, the left arm.. the left arm."
S02E08,JERRY,"(To Elaine) He saw that show on anorexia last year, and ate like an animal for two weeks."
S02E08,GEORGE,Why can't I have a heart attack? I'm allowed.
S02E08,JERRY,So what do you want? You want me take you to the hospital?
S02E08,GEORGE,"Manhattan Memorial, less of a line."
S02E08,JERRY,I'll call an ambulance. (Exits)
S02E08,WAITRESS,Is everything alright?
S02E08,GEORGE,"We'll just take a check. (She leaves the check. George, in all his cheapness, can't help but to review the check. He finds an error) You made a mistake on the.."

S02E08,MAN,Ooooooohhh..
S02E08,GEORGE,"I'm George.. George Costanza.. I've never been in the hospital a day in my life.. except when I had my tonsils out. You know, they never gave me any ice cream. I always felt that-"
S02E08,MAN,Shut up!
S02E08,JERRY,Well? What do you think?
S02E08,NURSE 1,"""Salami, salami, bologna."" Definitely."
S02E08,JERRY,"""Salami salami bologna""?"
S02E08,DOCTOR,"(In a hurry) Oh, your friend's fine. He didn't have a heart attack. I'll be in - in a few minutes."
S02E08,JERRY,"(Sarcastic) What a surprise. (Enters George's room overly sympathetic - leading George to think that the Doctor told Jerry something significant) Hey, how ya doin' buddy? You need anything? Do you want me to go out and get you a Superman comic?"
S02E08,GEORGE,"No, no thanks."
S02E08,JERRY,"(Still going along with the practical joke) You know, I was wondering.. You know that Black Hawks jacket you have?"
S02E08,GEORGE,"Oh, sure, my Black Hawks jacket. I love my Black Hawks jacket."
S02E08,JERRY,"Well, you know, I was thinking - if things don't exactly work out.."
S02E08,GEORGE,"Well, it wouldn't fit you. The sleeves are too short."
S02E08,JERRY,"No, I tried it on. It fits good."
S02E08,GEORGE,"Well, I didn't really think about what I was gonna do with all.."
S02E08,JERRY,"Well, you know.."
S02E08,GEORGE,"(Reluctantly) Well, okay."
S02E08,JERRY,"Oh, and.. do you think it would be alright if I called Susan Davis?"
S02E08,GEORGE,"Susan Davis? (Getting possessive) Hey, wait a second.."
S02E08,JERRY,"Well, it's not like we'd be bumping into you."
S02E08,GEORGE,I don't know.. you and Susan Davis?
S02E08,JERRY,"You know, if your future was a little more certain.."
S02E08,GEORGE,"Okay, go ahead. Call her, get married, have babies, have a great life.. What do I care? I'm finished. (Really depressed) It's all over for me. In fact, let's end it right now. Jerry, kill me, kill me now. I'm begging you. Let's just get it over with. Be a pal.. Just take the pillow and put it over my face."
S02E08,JERRY,"Well, ah.. (Takes his pillow) What? Kind of like this? (Violently smothers George with the pillow. George freaks out. He didn't think Jerry would actually do it)"
S02E08,GEORGE,"What are ya doing?! Whadya, crazy?!"
S02E08,ELAINE,Jerry!
S02E08,JERRY,"(Acts like he was cought red-handed) Elaine, what are you doing here? (Takes the pillow off George, and puts it back on his bed)"
S02E08,GEORGE,(To Jerry) Jerk off.
S02E08,JERRY,(Whispering) There's nothing wrong with him. I saw the doctor. He's fine.
S02E08,ELAINE,"Hi, George. How ya feeling? Is anybody getting your apartment?"
S02E08,GEORGE,"I'll tell ya, if I ever get out of here, I'm gonna change my life. I'm gonna do a whole Zen thing. Take up yoga, meditate.. I'll eat right. Calm down, lose my anger.. (Sees Jerry and Elaine aren't listening. He snaps) Hey, is anybody listening?!"
S02E08,DOCTOR,"(To Elaine) Uh, hello. (To George) Uh, Mr. Costanza?"
S02E08,GEORGE,"(Panicky) Uh, yeah. You know, Doctor, I gotta tell you, I feel a lot better."
S02E08,DOCTOR,"Well, we looked at your EKG's, ran some tests, did a complete work-up."
S02E08,GEORGE,"(Getting in a more panicked state) Oh God, Mommy!"
S02E08,DOCTOR,And you simply haven't had a heart attack.
S02E08,GEORGE,"(Relieved) I haven't? I'm okay? I'm okay? Oh, thank you, thank you, Doctor! I don't know how to thank you."
S02E08,JERRY,"(Sarcastic) Hey, that was really fun, George. Can we go home now?"
S02E08,DOCTOR,"No, actually, we'd like to keep him here overnight for observation, just to be safe."
S02E08,GEORGE,"Oh, sure. Sure, anything. Can you believe it? There's nothing wrong with me."
S02E08,DOCTOR,"Well, I wouldn't go that far."
S02E08,GEORGE,(Starting to panic again) What? Oh my God. What? Is it meningitis? Scoliosis? Lupis?! Is it Lupis?!
S02E08,DOCTOR,Have you ever had your tonsils taken out?
S02E08,GEORGE,"My tonsils? Yeah, when I was a kid."
S02E08,DOCTOR,"Well, they've grown back. Your adenoids are swollen too."
S02E08,GEORGE,Really?
S02E08,ELAINE,(Jokingly hits the doctor) Whose tonsils grow back? (Laughs)
S02E08,DOCTOR,It happens.
S02E08,JERRY,"Yeah, if you've been exposed to gamma rays."
S02E08,ELAINE,"I still have my tonsils. Everyone in my family has their tonsils. In fact, we were forbidden to socialize with anyone who didn't have their tonsils."
S02E08,DOCTOR,"That's interesting. Because, no one in my family has their tonsils, and we were forbidden to socialize with tonsil people."
S02E08,JERRY,"(Sarcastically) Well, it's like the Capulets and the Montagues."
S02E08,GEORGE,(Drawing attention back to him) Excuse me!
S02E08,DOCTOR,"Anyway, I strongly recommend they come out."
S02E08,GEORGE,What? You mean with a knife?
S02E08,DOCTOR,"Yes. With a knife. You know, snip, snip. Anyway, you'd be completely under, you wouldn't feel a thing. And when you wake up, you can have some ice cream."
S02E08,GEORGE,"(Angry) Yeah, that's what they told me the last time."
S02E08,DOCTOR,"Think about it. (Turns to leave, but runs into Elaine) Excuse me."
S02E08,ELAINE,"(Flustered) Oh, I'm sorry. (Doctor exits) I just.. have to ask that doctor one more question. (Leaves)"
S02E08,JERRY,Women go after doctors like men go after models. They want someone with knowledge of the body.. we just want the body.
S02E08,KRAMER,Hey.
S02E08,JERRY,Hey.
S02E08,KRAMER,"Boy, they got a great cafeteria downstairs. Hot food, sandwiches, a salad bar.. It's like a Sizzler's opened up a hospital! (Sits and starts eating) So, how did you have a heart attack? You're a young man. What were you doing? Are they gonna do a zipper job? Oh, they love to do zipper jobs."
S02E08,JERRY,(Trying to shut him up) Kramer.
S02E08,KRAMER,"The really bad thing about the heart is the sex thing. See, you gotta be careful about sex now. You get that heart pumping and suddenly, boom! Next thing you know, you got a hose coming out of your chest attached to a piece of luggage."
S02E08,JERRY,"Kramer, George didn't have a heart attack."
S02E08,KRAMER,No? That's good.
S02E08,GEORGE,I have to have my tonsils taken out.
S02E08,KRAMER,"Oh man.. No.. George, we gotta get you outta here. Get out! Right now! They'll kill ya in here."
S02E08,JERRY,(Trying to calm George down) It's routine surgery.
S02E08,KRAMER,"Oh yeah? My friend, Bob Saccomanno, he came in here for a hernia operation.. Oh yeah, routine surgery.. now he's sittin' around in a chair by a window going, ""My name is Bob"" .. George, whatever you do, don't let 'em cut you. Don't let 'em cut you.."
S02E08,GEORGE,"Well, what should I do, Kramer?"
S02E08,JERRY,"Well, for one think, don't listen to him."
S02E08,KRAMER,"I'll tell you what to do, I'll tell you what to do. You go to Tor Eckman. Tor, Tor, he'll fix you right up. He's a herbalist, a healer, George. He's not just gonna fix the tonsils and the adenoids, he is gonna change the whole way you function - body and mind."
S02E08,JERRY,Eckman? I thought he was doing time?
S02E08,KRAMER,"No, no, he's out. He got out. See, the medical establishment, see, they tried to frame him. It's all politics. But he's a rebel."
S02E08,JERRY,"A rebel? No. Johnny Yuma was a rebel. Eckman is a nut. George, you want to take care of your tonsils, you do it in a hospital. With a doctor."
S02E08,KRAMER,"He's holistic, George. He's holistic."
S02E08,GEORGE,Holistic.. that sounds right.
S02E08,JERRY,"George, you need a medical doctor."
S02E08,GEORGE,(To Jerry) Let me ask you something.. How much do you think it would cost to have tonsils and adenoids removed in the hospital?
S02E08,JERRY,"Well, an overnight stay in a hospital? Minor surgery? I dunno, four grand."
S02E08,GEORGE,Uh-huh. And how much does the healer charge?
S02E08,KRAMER,First visit? Thirty-eight bucks.
S02E08,GEORGE,"Oh, yeah? Holistic.. that's what I need. That's the answer."
S02E08,[Setting,Healer's apartment]
S02E08,GEORGE,"So, how do you like the way I talked you into comin' down here?"
S02E08,JERRY,"Don't flatter yourself, my friend. I'm here strictly for material, and I have a feeling this is a potential gold mine.. I still think you're nuts, though."
S02E08,GEORGE,"All I know is I've been going to doctors all my life. What has it gotten me? I'm thirty-three years old. I haven't outgrown the problems of puberty, I'm already facing the problems of old age. I completely skipped healthy adulthood. I went from having orgasms immediately to taking forever. You could do your taxes in the time it takes me to have an orgasm. I've never had a normal, medium orgasm."
S02E08,JERRY,(Jokingly making fun of George) I've never had a really good pickle.
S02E08,GEORGE,"Besides, what's it gonna cost me? Thirty-eight bucks?"
S02E08,TOR,(To Jerry) Would you not put your foot on that please?
S02E08,JERRY,Sorry.
S02E08,TOR,What month were you born?
S02E08,GEORGE,April.
S02E08,TOR,You should have been born in August. Your parents would have been well-advised to wait.
S02E08,GEORGE,Really?
S02E08,TOR,Do you use hot water in the shower?
S02E08,GEORGE,Yes.
S02E08,TOR,Stop using it.
S02E08,GEORGE,..Okay.
S02E08,KRAMER,I'm off hot water.
S02E08,TOR,Kramer tells me that you are interested in an alternative to surgery.
S02E08,GEORGE,"Yes, yes I am."
S02E08,TOR,"(Blows into George's face) I think we can help you. See, unfortunately, the medical establishment is a business like any other business. And business needs customers. And, they want to sell you their most expensive item which is unnecessary surgery."
S02E08,GEORGE,(Still on the showers) Can I use hot water on my face?
S02E08,TOR,"No. You know, I am not a business man. I'm a holistic healer. It's a calling, it's a gift. You see, it's in the best interest of the medical profession that you remain sick. You see, that insures good business. You're not a patient. You're a customer."
S02E08,JERRY,"(He thinks this, the audience can hear his thoughts) And you're not a doctor, but you play one in real life."
S02E08,GEORGE,(Still on the hot water) What about shaving?
S02E08,TOR,"(To Jerry) You're eating too much dairy. (To George) May I? (Reaches over, and touches George's face)"
S02E08,GEORGE,I guess so.
S02E08,TOR,"(Feeling George's face) You see, you are in disharmony. The throat is the gateway to the lung. Tonsillitis, adenoiditis, is, in Chinese medical terms, and invasion of heat and wind."
S02E08,JERRY,"(Again, we hear his thoughts) There's some hot air blowing in here.."
S02E08,TOR,"You know, I lived with the Eskimos many years ago, and they used to plunge their faces into the snow."
S02E08,GEORGE,"(Once again, still on the shower) Could it be lukewarm?"
S02E08,JERRY,Too much dairy? You really think I'm eating too much dairy?
S02E08,[Setting,Doctor's car]
S02E08,DOCTOR,"..The tongue.. yes, the tongue.. or, in medical terms, the glossa. It's a muscular organ.. Consists of two parts.. the body, and the root.. You see, it's covered by this mucous membrane.. These little raised projections are the papillae, which give it that furry appearance. Very tactile.."

S02E08,JERRY,I love crampbark.
S02E08,TOR,Cleavers.
S02E08,JERRY,"Cleaver, I once had cleaver as a kid. I was able to lift a car."
S02E08,TOR,And some couchgrass.
S02E08,JERRY,"Couchgrass and crampbark? You know, I think that's what killed Curly."
S02E08,KRAMER,"Go ahead, drink it, George."
S02E08,JERRY,"Excuse me, Tor. May I ask you a question? You have intuitive abilities. You're in touch with a lot of this cosmic kind of things.. I have this note I can't read. I was wondering if-"
S02E08,TOR,"(Takes the note, then laughs when he reads it) Oh, yes.. yes.. ""Cleveland 117, San Antonio 109.. (Hands note back to Jerry)"

Like, five, six thousand?.. (George signals that it's more) Well, live and learn.. at least we lived. Kramer went to Eckman.. He feels better alreadyy..

S02E09,JERRY,Is that like the end of the world or something?
S02E09,ELAINE,Certainly not.
S02E09,JERRY,Why shouldn't we be able to do that once in a while if we want to?
S02E09,ELAINE,I know.
S02E09,JERRY,"I mean, really, what is the big deal? We go in there. (Points to the bedroom) We're in there for a while. We come right back out here. It's not complicated."
S02E09,ELAINE,It's almost stupid if we didn't.
S02E09,JERRY,It's moronic.
S02E09,ELAINE,Absurd!
S02E09,JERRY,"Of course, I guess, maybe, some little problems could arise."
S02E09,ELAINE,"We, there are always a few."
S02E09,JERRY,"I mean, if anything happened, and we couldn't be friends the way we are now, that would be really bad."
S02E09,ELAINE,Devastating.
S02E09,JERRY,Because this is very good. (Points back and forth between them to indicate friendship)
S02E09,ELAINE,And that would be good. (Points to bedroom)
S02E09,JERRY,That would be good too. The idea is combine the this and the that. But this cannot be disturbed.
S02E09,ELAINE,"Yeah, we just wanna take this and add that."
S02E09,JERRY,"But of course, we'd have to figure out a way to avoid the things that cause the little problems. Maybe some rules or something."
S02E09,ELAINE,Huh.
S02E09,JERRY,"For example, now, I call you whenever I'm inclined and vice versa."
S02E09,ELAINE,Right.
S02E09,JERRY,"But if we did that, we might feel a certain obligation to call."
S02E09,ELAINE,"Well why should that be? Oh, I have an idea. I have an idea. No call the day after that."
S02E09,JERRY,Beautiful. Let's make it a rule.
S02E09,ELAINE,"All right, sir."
S02E09,JERRY,Now here's another little rule.
S02E09,ELAINE,Yeah.
S02E09,JERRY,"When we see each other now, we retire to our separate quarters. But sometimes, when people get involved with that, they feel pressure to sleep over. When that is not really sleep. Sleep is separate from that. And I don't see why sleep got all tied up and connected with that."
S02E09,ELAINE,"Okay, okay. Rule Number Two. Spending the night is optional!"
S02E09,JERRY,Well now we're gettin' somewhere.
S02E09,ELAINE,What about the kiss goodnight?
S02E09,JERRY,Tough one. You're call.
S02E09,ELAINE,It's brug-wa (?).
S02E09,JERRY,Fine. Well.
S02E09,ELAINE,Well.
S02E09,JERRY,You ready?
S02E09,ELAINE,Ready.
S02E09,JERRY,So think you can handle this?
S02E09,ELAINE,Definitely. (Runs into bookshelf)
S02E09,KRAMER,Hey.
S02E09,JERRY,Hey.
S02E09,KRAMER,Got the paper?
S02E09,JERRY,Not yet.
S02E09,KRAMER,No paper?
S02E09,JERRY,I haven't been out yet.
S02E09,KRAMER,"Well, what's taking you so long? (Elaine enters from the bedroom. Kramer is a little shocked) Uh? Oh, well, yeah... (He exits)"
S02E09,GEORGE,"What's the deal with Aquaman? Could he go on land, or was he just restricted to water?"
S02E09,JERRY,"No, I think I saw him on land a couple times. So how's the job situation goin'?"
S02E09,GEORGE,Still lookin'. It's pretty bad out there. What about you?
S02E09,JERRY,Nothin' much. I slept with Elaine last night.
S02E09,GEORGE,Oxygen! I need some oxygen! This is major.
S02E09,JERRY,I thought you'd like that.
S02E09,GEORGE,"Oh, this is huge!"
S02E09,JERRY,I know.
S02E09,GEORGE,"All right, okay. Let's go, details."
S02E09,JERRY,"No, I can't do details."
S02E09,GEORGE,You wha?
S02E09,JERRY,I can't give details.
S02E09,GEORGE,No details?
S02E09,JERRY,I'm not in the mood.
S02E09,GEORGE,"You ask me here to have lunch, tell me you slept with Elaine, and then say you're not in the mood for details. Now you listen to me. I want details and I want them right now. I don't have a job, I have no place to go. You're not in the mood? Well you get in the mood!"
S02E09,JERRY,"All right, okay. We're in the apartment watching TV."
S02E09,GEORGE,Where are you sitting?
S02E09,JERRY,On the couch.
S02E09,GEORGE,Next to each other?
S02E09,JERRY,"No, separated."
S02E09,GEORGE,Time?
S02E09,JERRY,Around eleven.
S02E09,GEORGE,"Okay, go ahead."
S02E09,JERRY,"So she's flipping around the TV, and she gets to the naked station."
S02E09,GEORGE,"Oh, see? that's why I don't have cable in my house. Because of that naked station. If I had that in my house, I would never turn it off. I wouldn't sleep, I wouldn't eat. Eventually, firemen would have to break through the door, they'd find me sitting there in my pajamas with drool coming down my face. All right, all right. So you're watching the naked station."
S02E09,JERRY,"And then, somehow, we started talking about, what if we had sex."
S02E09,GEORGE,"Boy, these are really bad details."
S02E09,JERRY,"It pains me to say this, but I may be getting to mature for details."
S02E09,GEORGE,Oh I hate to hear this. That kind of growth really irritates me.
S02E09,JERRY,Well. I'll tell you though. It was really passionate.
S02E09,GEORGE,Better than before?
S02E09,JERRY,She must've taken some kind of seminar or something.
S02E09,GEORGE,This is all too much. So what are you feeling? What's going on? Are you like a couple again now?
S02E09,JERRY,Not exactly.
S02E09,GEORGE,Not exactly. What does that mean?
S02E09,JERRY,"Well, we've tried to arrange a situation where we'll be able to do this once in a while and still be friends. (George laughs hysterically and stands out of his seat)"
S02E09,GEORGE,Where are you living? Are you here? Are you on this planet? It's impossible. It can't be done.
S02E09,JERRY,I think we've worked out a system.
S02E09,GEORGE,"Oh, you know what you're like? You're like a pathetic gambler. You're one of those losers in Las Vegas who keeps thinking he's gonna come up with a way to win at blackjack."
S02E09,JERRY,"No, this is very advanced. We've designed at set of rules that we can maintain the friendship by avoiding all of the relationship pitfalls."
S02E09,GEORGE,"Sure, all right. Tell me the rules."
S02E09,JERRY,Okay. No calls the next day.
S02E09,GEORGE,"(To himself) So you're havin' the sex, next day you don't have to call. That's pretty good. (Back to Jerry) Go ahead."
S02E09,JERRY,You ready for the second one?
S02E09,GEORGE,"I have tell you, I'm pretty impressed with the first one."
S02E09,JERRY,Spending the night. Optional.
S02E09,GEORGE,"No, you see? You got greedy."
S02E09,JERRY,"No, that's the rule. It's optional."
S02E09,GEORGE,"I know less about women than anyone in the world. But one thing I do know is they're not happy if you don't spend the night. It could be a hot, sweaty room with no air conditioning and all they have is a little army cot this wide (Displays with French fry) You're not going anywhere."
S02E09,JERRY,I think you're wrong.
S02E09,GEORGE,I hope I am.
S02E09,JERRY,Is this yours or the roommate's?
S02E09,ELAINE,The roommate's.
S02E09,JERRY,Would she mind?
S02E09,ELAINE,She keeps track of everything.
S02E09,JERRY,"Well, that's too bad, 'cause I'm takin' it."
S02E09,ELAINE,Thanks.
S02E09,JERRY,"Well, guess I'll get going."
S02E09,ELAINE,Oh.
S02E09,JERRY,"Well, I got that root canal tomorrow morning. It'll be easier if I go home."
S02E09,ELAINE,"Fine, go away."
S02E09,JERRY,I don't understand. Is there a problem? (Elaine is pulling a roll of paper towels about twenty feet long) I'm getting the impression there's a problem.
S02E09,ELAINE,Just go.
S02E09,JERRY,I'm having surgery tomorrow.
S02E09,ELAINE,"Oh, surgery. You're going to the dentist."
S02E09,JERRY,"But you said, it can be very serious."
S02E09,ELAINE,"Okay, so fine. Go."
S02E09,JERRY,What happened to the rules? Remember? Sleeping over was optional.
S02E09,ELAINE,"Yeah, it's my house, it's my option."
S02E09,JERRY,It has nothing to do with whose house it is.
S02E09,ELAINE,"Oh, of course it does. (Elaine's roommate, Tina, enters)"
S02E09,Tina,Hi.
S02E09,Elaine + JERRY,Hi.
S02E09,Tina,"Hi, Jerry."
S02E09,JERRY,Hi.
S02E09,Tina,Such a great improv class tonight.
S02E09,ELAINE,Oh really?
S02E09,Tina,"I had this improv where I pretended I was working in one of those booths. You know, in the amusement park, where you have to shoot the water in the clown's mouth and you have to blow up the balloon."
S02E09,ELAINE,"Uh, Tina? Could you excuse us for just one second?"
S02E09,Tina,"Oh, yeah. I'll excuse you. (She walks away)"
S02E09,ELAINE,What are you doing?
S02E09,JERRY,I can't go if you're mad.
S02E09,ELAINE,I'm not mad.
S02E09,JERRY,You seemed a little mad.
S02E09,ELAINE,"No, no. Jerry, I'm fine really. It's okay."
S02E09,JERRY,So you're okay with everything?
S02E09,ELAINE,Definitely. Are you?
S02E09,JERRY,"Definitely. Well, goodnight."
S02E09,ELAINE,Goodn-- (He starts to kiss her) What're you doing?
S02E09,JERRY,What?
S02E09,ELAINE,Rules.
S02E09,Tina,"Hey, who took my cake? (Jerry exits quickly)"
S02E09,GEORGE,What about jewelry? That's very nice gift.
S02E09,JERRY,"No, no. I have to be very careful here. I don't want to send the wrong message. Especially after the other night."
S02E09,GEORGE,Maybe I'll get her some jewelry.
S02E09,JERRY,"No, no. You can't get her anything better than me. Whatever I spend, you have to spend half."
S02E09,GEORGE,"What am I supposed to get, a bazooka?"
S02E09,JERRY,"You don't understand. I'm in a very delicate position. Whatever I give her, she's going to be bringing in experts from all over the country to interpret the meaning behind it."
S02E09,GEORGE,What does she need? Maybe there's something that she needs.
S02E09,JERRY,I think I heard her say something about a bench.
S02E09,GEORGE,A bench? What kind of a bench?
S02E09,JERRY,"I don't know, but she mentioned a bench."
S02E09,GEORGE,"What, like at a bus stop?"
S02E09,JERRY,I don't know.
S02E09,GEORGE,Like a park bench?
S02E09,JERRY,I have no idea.
S02E09,GEORGE,Who puts a bench in their house?
S02E09,JERRY,Forget the bench.
S02E09,GEORGE,I got it. You wanna get her something nice? How 'bout a music box?
S02E09,JERRY,"No, too relationshippy. She opens it up, she hears that Laura's theme, I'm dead."
S02E09,GEORGE,"Okay, what about a nice frame? With a picture of another guy in it. Frame says I care for you, but if you wanna get serious, perhaps you'd be interested in someone like this."
S02E09,JERRY,Nice looking fellow.
S02E09,GEORGE,What about candle holders?
S02E09,JERRY,Too romantic.
S02E09,GEORGE,Lingerie?
S02E09,JERRY,Too sexual.
S02E09,GEORGE,Waffle maker.
S02E09,JERRY,Too domestic.
S02E09,GEORGE,Bust of Nelson Rockefeller.
S02E09,JERRY,Too Gubernatorial. (?)
S02E09,GEORGE,Let's work on the card.
S02E09,JERRY,Maybe you won't like it.
S02E09,ELAINE,"Oh, how could I not like it? Of course I'll like it."
S02E09,JERRY,You could not like it.
S02E09,ELAINE,Just the fact that you remembered means everything.
S02E09,JERRY,"Of course I remembered. You reminded me everyday for two months. Oh, the card. (She opens)"
S02E09,ELAINE,Cash?
S02E09,JERRY,Would do you think?
S02E09,ELAINE,You got me cash?
S02E09,JERRY,Well this way I figure you can go out and get yourself whatever you want. No good?
S02E09,ELAINE,"Who are you, my uncle?"
S02E09,JERRY,Well come on. That's $182 right there. I don't think that's anything to sneeze at.
S02E09,ELAINE,"Let me see the card. (Reading) To a wonderful girl, a great pal, and more? (Kramer enters)"
S02E09,KRAMER,"Hey. Oh, Elaine. I'm glad you're here. Stay right there. I'm gonna be right back. (He exits)"
S02E09,ELAINE,Pal? You think I'm your pal?
S02E09,JERRY,"I said, ""and more."""
S02E09,ELAINE,I am not your pal.
S02E09,JERRY,What's wrong with pal? Why is everyone so down on pal? (Kramer enters with present)
S02E09,ELAINE,"Oh, what is this? You got me something?"
S02E09,KRAMER,Yeah. Open it.
S02E09,ELAINE,Oh Kramer... (She opens it) The bench! You got me the bench that I wanted! (Jerry looks irritated)
S02E09,KRAMER,"That's pretty good, huh?"
S02E09,JERRY,Great.
S02E09,KRAMER,Remember when we were standing there and she mentioned it? I made a mental note of it.
S02E09,JERRY,Well goody for you.
S02E09,KRAMER,"Oh yeah, I'm very sensitive about that. I mean, when someone's birthday comes up, I keep my ears open. So what'd you get her?"
S02E09,JERRY,182 bucks.
S02E09,KRAMER,Cash? You gotta be kidding. What kind of gift is that? That's like something her uncle would get her.
S02E09,ELAINE,(Reading card) Think where man's glory most begins and ends and say my glory was I had such a friend.
S02E09,KRAMER,(To Jerry) Yates.
S02E09,ELAINE,Oh Kramer. (They embrace)
S02E09,JERRY,Could you excuse us please?
S02E09,KRAMER,What?
S02E09,JERRY,We're talking.
S02E09,KRAMER,"Oh, the relationship. (He leaves)"
S02E09,JERRY,"You know, we never had one fight before this deal."
S02E09,ELAINE,I know.
S02E09,JERRY,Never.
S02E09,ELAINE,Ever.
S02E09,JERRY,We got along beautifully.
S02E09,ELAINE,Like clams.
S02E09,JERRY,It was wonderful.
S02E09,ELAINE,A pleasure.
S02E09,JERRY,"So I think we should just forget the whole deal, and go back to being friends."
S02E09,ELAINE,I can't do it.
S02E09,JERRY,You what?
S02E09,ELAINE,I can't do that.
S02E09,JERRY,"You mean it's... (She nods) No this. No that. No this or that. Oh, boy. Hmmm. What do you want?"
S02E09,ELAINE,"This, that, and the other."
S02E09,JERRY,"Oh, sure. Of course, you're entitled. Who doesn't want this, that, and the other?"
S02E09,ELAINE,You.
S02E09,JERRY,(Starts to correct then realizes) Well...
S02E09,GEORGE,"Those birthdays. I told you. They're relationship killers. If a relationship is having any problems whatsoever, a birthday will always bring it out."
S02E09,JERRY,I never should have made up those rules.
S02E09,GEORGE,What is it about sex that just disrupts everything? Is it the touching? Is it the nudity?
S02E09,JERRY,It can't be the nudity. I never got into these terrible fights and misunderstandings when I was changing before gym class.
S02E09,GEORGE,You know what this means? I can't see her anymore either.
S02E09,JERRY,Why?
S02E09,GEORGE,"It's break up by association. Besides, she's mad at me anyway because of my birthday present."
S02E09,JERRY,What did you end up giving her?
S02E09,GEORGE,91 dollars.
S02E09,JERRY,Sorry about that.
S02E09,GEORGE,So what're you gonna do?
S02E09,JERRY,"Well, if I call her, there's no joking around anymore. This is pretty much it."
S02E09,GEORGE,"So, maybe this should be it."
S02E09,JERRY,Could be it.
S02E09,GEORGE,She seems like an it.
S02E09,JERRY,"She's at it as you get. Imagine bumping into her on the street in five years with a husband. And she tells me he's a sculptor, they live in Vermont..."
S02E09,GEORGE,We'd have to kill him.
S02E09,JERRY,"We'd get caught, I'd get the chair."
S02E09,GEORGE,I'd go to prison as your accomplice. I'd have to wear that really heavy denim. Go to the cafeteria line with the guy who slops those mashed potatoes onto your plate. Go to the bathroom in front of hundreds of people.
S02E09,JERRY,"Plus, you know what else."
S02E09,GEORGE,You better call her.
S02E09,KRAMER,Hey.
S02E09,JERRY,Hey.
S02E09,KRAMER,You got the paper yet?
S02E09,JERRY,Yeah.
S02E09,KRAMER,"Well where is it? (Elaine enters from bedroom with newspaper) Hey, you done with that?"
S02E09,ELAINE,No.
S02E09,KRAMER,"Well, you're not reading it now."
S02E09,ELAINE,"All right, you can take it. But I want it back."
S02E09,KRAMER,"Oh yeah. So, ah, what're you guys gonna do today?"
S02E09,ELAINE,"Ah, this. And that."
S02E09,JERRY,And the other.
S02E09,KRAMER,"Boy, I really liked the two of you much better when you weren't a couple. (He exits)"
S02E10,[Setting,Night club]
S02E10,JERRY,"Men flip around the television more than women, I think. Men get that remote control in their hands, they don't even know what the hell they're watching. You know, we just keep going, ""Rerun, don't wanna watch it.. "" ""What are you watching?"" ""I don't care, I gotta keep going."" ""Who was that?"" ""I don't know what it was - doesn't matter, it's not your fault. It doesn't matter, I gotta keep going."" Women don't do this. See now, women will stop and go, ""Well, let me see what the show is before I change the channel."" You see? Men just fly. Because women, you see, women nest and men hunt. That's why we watch TV differently. Before there was flipping around, before there was television, kings and emperors and pharaohs and such had story-tellers that would tell them stories 'cause that was their entertainment. I always wonder, in that era, if they would get, like, thirty story-tellers together so they could still flip around. Just go, ""Alright start telling me a story, what's happening? I don't want to hear anymore. Shut up. Go to the next guy. What are you talking about? Is there a girl in that story? ..No? Shut up. Go to the next guy. What do you got? I don't want to hear that either. Shut up. No, go ahead, what are you talking about?.. I don't want to hear that. No, the all of you, get out of here. I'm going to bed."""
S02E10,[Setting,Coffee shop]
S02E10,GEORGE,"(Shocked) She's pregnant? Leslie is pregnant?! Oh, see, there is no justice."
S02E10,JERRY,"She's the performance artist, right?"
S02E10,GEORGE,"(Sarcastic) Yeah, performance artist. She's a real performer. A real trooper."
S02E10,JERRY,"What's her husband's name, again? Chip? Kip? Skip?"
S02E10,ELAINE,Todd.
S02E10,JERRY,Todd. Oh yeah. (To George) He's a Kennedy.
S02E10,ELAINE,"No, he's not."
S02E10,JERRY,"C'mon. He's a third cousin, or something."
S02E10,ELAINE,By marriage.
S02E10,JERRY,"Oh, by marriage. (To George) We went to their wedding. You should have heard him talking about Chappaquiddick - trying to blame the whole thing on bad directions."
S02E10,GEORGE,That woman was unequivocally the worst date of my life.
S02E10,ELAINE,"Oh, pardon me for trying to set you up with a beautiful, intelligent woman."
S02E10,GEORGE,"What, you don't think I can attract beautiful, intelligent women?"
S02E10,JERRY,"Thin ice, George. Thin ice.."
S02E10,GEORGE,(Sarcastic) Maybe for her new performance piece she'll give birth on stage.
S02E10,ELAINE,She stopped performing.
S02E10,GEORGE,"(Again, sarcastic) Oh, what a huge blow to the culture."
S02E10,JERRY,(Gesturing to George) You believe this guy? He holds a grudge like Khomeini.
S02E10,GEORGE,"She dragged me down to that warehouse on the waterfront in Brooklin to see one of her ""performances""."
S02E10,JERRY,"Oh, and she cooks dinner onstage for some celebrity?"
S02E10,GEORGE,"God! She's cooking dinner for God! She's yelling and screaming, and the next thing I know, she throws a big can of chocolate syrup all over my new red shirt."
S02E10,ELAINE,It was an accident!
S02E10,GEORGE,"Oh, yeah, sure, accident, right. She was aiming right at me like she was putting out a fire! Then, for the rest of the show, I'm sitting there with chocolate all over my shirt. Flies are landing on me. I'm boiling - I'm fantasizing all the things I'm gonna say when I see her. And later, finally, backstage when I talk to her, I'm a groveling worm. ""What kind of chocolate was that? Do you throw any other foods?"""
S02E10,JERRY,(To Elaine) he thought he still had a shot.
S02E10,GEORGE,"And then, then, then she leaves with somebody else! Never even, never even said goodbye! Never called me back.. Never apologized. Nothing. Like I was dirt."
S02E10,JERRY,What ever happened with the shirt?
S02E10,GEORGE,I still have it. The collar's okay. I wear it under sweaters.
S02E10,ELAINE,I don't know what I'm gonna do. She asked me to give her a baby shower.
S02E10,JERRY,Asked you? You're not going to do that are you?
S02E10,ELAINE,"anyone else, never. But, Leslie - I have a problem saying no to. For some reason, I seem to want her approval."
S02E10,GEORGE,Let Maria Shriver give her a baby shower.
S02E10,JERRY,Ask not what I can do for you - ask what you can do for me.
S02E10,GEORGE,(Germanic) Ich bin ein sucker.
S02E10,ELAINE,"Oh, would you two stop with the Kennedys? Why does everybody make such a big deal about he Kennedys? What is this fascination?! Who cares?! It's all so boring.."
S02E10,GEORGE,She doesn't deserve a baby shower. She deserves a baby monsoon. She deserves Rosemary's baby!
S02E10,ELAINE,"(To Jerry) I do have one teeny little problem, though."
S02E10,GEORGE,Never said goodbye. Never apologized. Nothing.
S02E10,ELAINE,"See, I was gonna give the shower in my apartment.."
S02E10,JERRY,But?
S02E10,ELAINE,My roommate has Lyme disease.
S02E10,JERRY,Lyme disease? I thought she had Epstein-Barr Syndrome?
S02E10,ELAINE,She has this in addition to Epstein-Barr. It's like Epstein-Barr with a twist of Lyme disease.
S02E10,JERRY,How did she get Lyme disease?
S02E10,ELAINE,"I don't know. She did some outdoor version of Hair in Danbury, Connecticut."
S02E10,JERRY,They still do that play?
S02E10,ELAINE,It's a classic.
S02E10,JERRY,With all the nudity?
S02E10,ELAINE,I guess. She must've rolled over on a tick during the love-in.
S02E10,GEORGE,(Still mad a Leslie) Never said goodbye. Goodbye!
S02E10,JERRY,Explain to me how this baby shower thing works.
S02E10,ELAINE,What do you wanna know?
S02E10,JERRY,"Well, I mean, does it ever erupt into a drunken orgy of violence?"
S02E10,ELAINE,Rarely.
S02E10,JERRY,"There's no hazing of the fetus, or anything, is there?"
S02E10,ELAINE,No.
S02E10,JERRY,When is this suppose to be?
S02E10,ELAINE,Saturday.
S02E10,JERRY,"Saturday?.. Well, I have a show in Buffalo on Saturday. They're not gonna bust up my apartment, or anything, are they?"
S02E10,ELAINE,I'll take full responsibility. You won't regret it.
S02E10,JERRY,"'Cause I've seen these pregnant women - and they sometimes misjudge their fetal girth. Just like one wrong turn, and boom! And entire buffet is swept off the table."
S02E10,GEORGE,"Someday, before I die, mark my words - I'm gonna tell that woman exactly what I think of her. I'll never be able to forgive myself until I do."
S02E10,JERRY,And if you do?
S02E10,GEORGE,I still won't be able to forgive myself - but at least it won't be about this.
S02E10,[Setting,Jerry's apartment]
S02E10,KRAMER,What are you doing this for? Look at you..
S02E10,JERRY,Quiet. I'm trying to get a picture.
S02E10,KRAMER,But you don't have to do this! This guy is waiting in my house.
S02E10,JERRY,(Pleading) Leave me alone.
S02E10,KRAMER,It's a one-time fee. A hundred and fifty bucks. Why live like this?!
S02E10,JERRY,I'm not getting illegal cable!
S02E10,KRAMER,"Oh, so what are you gonna do? You gonna wait for the cable companies to resolve their dispute? They're gonna be in court for years."
S02E10,JERRY,"No, I read in the paper.."
S02E10,KRAMER,"(Sarcastic) Oh, oh, the paper.."
S02E10,JERRY,"Well, they might hook us up again."
S02E10,KRAMER,"Oh, God, you're so naive! All the cable companies care about is the ""Big Mammoo."" (Jerry wacks the TV) Oh, look at you! You're banging things.. Pathetic. Just wasting your life. I'm offering you fifty-six channels - movies, sports, nudity. And it's free! For life!"
S02E10,JERRY,Stop shouting! You're ruining the reception.
S02E10,KRAMER,"Can you hear yourself? Can, can, do you know what you're saying?!"
S02E10,JERRY,What you're suggesting is illegal.
S02E10,KRAMER,It's not illegal.
S02E10,JERRY,It's against the law.
S02E10,KRAMER,"Well, yeah."
S02E10,JERRY,"(Gesturing to the rabbit ears) Just, just, hold this. Can you hold that?"
S02E10,KRAMER,"(Holding the rabbit ears) Look, will you at least let me bring the guy over? He's an amazing man. He's a Russian immigrant. He escaped the Gulag. He's like the Sakharov of cable guys.. He'll slow down your gas meter. He sells slugs, Jerry. Slugs for the subway."
S02E10,JERRY,"A real human rights nut, huh?"
S02E10,KRAMER,"Yeah. He's intense, man."
S02E10,JERRY,I don't know. What if I get caught?
S02E10,KRAMER,"Oh, you're not gonna get caught. Look, let me get him. Man, it's the nineties, it's Hammer time! Come on, just let me get him."
S02E10,JERRY,"You know, why don't we wait? Because, I'm going out of town tomarrow."
S02E10,TABACHNICK,Tomarrow okay.
S02E10,KRAMER,"No problem. Yeah, you'll have the whole thing installed by the time you get back."
S02E10,JERRY,"(Mutters to himself) Every time I turn on the TV, sirens are gonna go off. They're gonna track me down like a dog, I know it.."
S02E10,KRAMER,"No, no, now look now, Jerry, Jerry, it's no risk. I swear. The Mets have seventy-five games on cable this year.."
S02E10,JERRY,"(Pauses, thinking about what Kramer just said) Put it in."
S02E10,KRAMER,"You won't regret it. (Jerry mutters some more, Kramer rubs his hands together in anticipation, then starts dancing around with a reluctant Jerry) Jerry's gonna be a cable boy, a cable boy, a cable boy.."
S02E10,[Setting,Jerry's apartment]
S02E10,MAN,Mr. Steinfeld?
S02E10,JERRY,Seinfeld.
S02E10,MAN,We're with the FBI. You wanna tell us about your cable hook-up?
S02E10,JERRY,My cable hook-up? What about it?
S02E10,MAN,"It's been illegally installed, Mr. Steinfeld."
S02E10,JERRY,It has? I've been out of town. How did you know?
S02E10,KRAMER,"Jerry, I had to tell them. I had to. I had no choice. They were onto the scam from the very beginning."
S02E10,MAN,"You're in serious trouble, Mr. Steinfeld."
S02E10,JERRY,"Wait a minute. Wait a minute, hold on! We're just patsies. We're just a couple of users.. We never sold the stuff. What about the Russian guy? The Russian guy is the guy you want."
S02E10,TABACHNICK,"Mr. Seinfeld, Agent Stone. FBI. Undercover."
S02E10,KRAMER,"No! Jerry! (The FBI agents open fire. Jerry's gunned down by a hailstorm of bullets. Kramer leans next to a fallen Jerry, cupping Jerry's head in his hands) Cable boy, cable boy.. What have you done to my little cable boy?.."
S02E10,[Setting,Airplane]
S02E10,JERRY,Excuse me. Can I get something to drink?
S02E10,STEWARDESS,I'm afraid not.
S02E10,JERRY,"What's with this airline? What are you, cutting out the drinks now?"
S02E10,STEWARDESS,No sir. We're flying into a blizzard. Please fasten your seat belt. We're making an emergency landing.
S02E10,JERRY,(Sarcastic) Are they gonna go over the instructions again?
S02E10,BILL,My name is Bill. I might be the last person you ever see.
S02E10,[Setting,Night club]
S02E10,JERRY,"I'm not afraid of flying, although many people do have fear of flying and, I have no arguement with that. I think fear of flying is quite rational because, human beings cannot fly. Humans have fear of flying same way fish have fear of driving. Put a fish behind the wheel, and they go, ""This isn't right. I shouldn't be doing this. I don't belong here."""
S02E10,[Setting,George's car]
S02E10,GEORGE,Sounds like a rough trip.
S02E10,JERRY,"Oh, fire engines, ambulances all along the runway. And then, when we landed safely, they all seemed so disappointed."
S02E10,GEORGE,"So, the college cancelled the gig?"
S02E10,JERRY,"Well, there was so much snow. The roads were closed. I really appreciate it - you picking me up. Thanks again."
S02E10,GEORGE,(Modestly) Forget it.
S02E10,JERRY,"No, really.. an airport run."
S02E10,GEORGE,It's nothing.
S02E10,JERRY,"Hey, it's one thing if I asked you ""Could you do me a favor?"" ..But to suggest it?.. GEORGE (Obviously up to something. Jerry doesn't suspect anything - yet) Whey you told me what you went through on the plane, it makes you stop and think. You appreciate having a real friend."
S02E10,JERRY,"(Joking) You know, if Richie Brandes did this, I'd be suspicious, you know. He's always got some ulterior motive."
S02E10,GEORGE,(Laughs nervously) ..Ulterior motive.
S02E10,JERRY,"Oh, wait a minute. Wait a minute. Don't take the bridge.. Get off here. We can't go back to my place, Elaine's having the shower."
S02E10,GEORGE,"(Obviously knows that, but pretends he doesn't) What, tonight? Now?"
S02E10,JERRY,"Yeah, yeah. I forgot all about it. Alright, it's no big deal. We'll just go back to your place."
S02E10,GEORGE,"My place? NO, no, no. I hate my place. I don't wanna go back to my place."
S02E10,JERRY,You want to get a bite?
S02E10,GEORGE,"Yeah, I would. It's just, you know, I just ate a whole pot roast."
S02E10,JERRY,"Well, so what should we do?"
S02E10,GEORGE,Shouldn't we at least drop off your bag?
S02E10,JERRY,Red shirt! Red shirt! That's the red shirt!
S02E10,GEORGE,(Nervous) What are you talking about?
S02E10,JERRY,You're wearing the chocolate shirt!
S02E10,GEORGE,I am? What a strange coincidence..
S02E10,JERRY,"A - Ha! Nice try, my friend, but you gotta get up pretty early in the morning.."
S02E10,GEORGE,(Pleading) You gotta let me go over there.
S02E10,JERRY,"What are you gonna do? Badger a pregnant woman at her own baby shower?! What are you, gonna take it off and make her rinse it in club soda?"
S02E10,GEORGE,"No, I'm gonna hold it under her nose so she can smell the scent of stale Bosco that I had to live with for three years, and I'm gonna say, ""Remember this shirt, baby?! Well, now, it's payback time!"""

S02E10,LESLIE,We just bought an apartment on Riverside Drive. Bernard Goetz's mother used to live there.
S02E10,ELAINE,"So, where's Todd?"
S02E10,LESLIE,Up in Hyannisport.
S02E10,ELAINE,"Oh my God, Hyannisport? With the Kennedys? Who else is up there? Is Rose up there?!"
S02E10,WOMAN,"(To Leslie) So, when's your due date?"
S02E10,LESLIE,"March twentieth, nine a.m."
S02E10,WOMAN,You know the time!
S02E10,LESLIE,"I'm having a planned C-section. My therapist told me if I go through labor, I might get psychotic."
S02E10,ELAINE,"Leslie, Leslie, whatever happened to Sargent Shriver? Is he still with them? You don't hear much about him these days. Is he out of the loop?"
S02E10,LESLIE,"(Takes a bite of food) Elaine, who catered this, Sears?"
S02E10,ELAINE,(Whispering to Kramer) What is this?! What are you doing here?
S02E10,KRAMER,We're putting in cable.
S02E10,ELAINE,"The cable? No, no, no. I'm having a party here. You can't do this now!"
S02E10,KRAMER,"Oh, we have to do this now."
S02E10,ELAINE,Who's this guy?
S02E10,KRAMER,Which one?
S02E10,ELAINE,Both of the them.
S02E10,KRAMER,"Oh, they're Soviet Cable guys."
S02E10,ELAINE,Okay.. Does Jerry know about this?
S02E10,KRAMER,"Oh yeah.. it's all authorized, yeah."
S02E10,ELAINE,You can't! You can't do this now!
S02E10,KRAMER,"Elaine, do you know how booked up this guy is? Now, if I send him away now, it's gonna take Jerry months to get him back.. He won't like that."
S02E10,ELAINE,Alright. Just do it fast and then get out.
S02E10,KRAMER,"(Snaps his fingers) Anatoly! (The Russians get to work on command. To Elaine) Look, it's gonna take a few minutes.. Then, you and the gals can take a load off and watch something on Lifetime."
S02E10,[Setting,George's car]
S02E10,JERRY,And what if we go up there? What are you going to say to her?
S02E10,GEORGE,(Boiling) What am I going to say?!
S02E10,JERRY,Yeah.
S02E10,GEORGE,"What did you go out with me for?! Just to dump chocolate on my shirt and then just dump me altogether?! I don't deserve that kind of treatment! What, you don't have the common courtesy to return my calls?! To apologize! You think I'm some sort of a loser, that likes to be abused and ignored?! Who's shirt can be ruined without financial restitution?! Some sort of a masochist who enjoys being humiliated? You think you can avoid me like I have some sort of disease?! You have the disease! You have the disease! You may be beautiful and rich and physically .. just .. unbelievable, but you sicken me! You disgust me! You and everyone like you!"
S02E10,JERRY,You'll never say that to her face.

S02E10,KRAMER,"(Flirting with a female guest) Yeah, I eat the whole apple. The core, stem, seeds, everything."
S02E10,ELAINE,"(To Kramer) Kramer, Kramer, look at him. (Gestures to Tabachnick) Look! He's eating all the food!"
S02E10,KRAMER,"Yeah, yeah. Well, you know, there are many differences between American and Soviet cultures that you're not aware of. See, in Russian, the cable guy, they got the whole run of the house. Yeah, that's tradition. (Turns back to the woman) Did you ever eat the bark of a pineapple?"
S02E10,ELAINE,Kramer!
S02E10,KRAMER,(Trying to break up the fight) Uh.. Excuse me..
S02E10,ELAINE,What are you doing here? I thought you were out of town for the weekend.
S02E10,JERRY,The show was cancelled. There was a blizzard.
S02E10,ELAINE,"I can't believe you told Kramer it's okay to put the cable in during the shower! Jerry, look,, look! They've eaten everything."
S02E10,LESLIE,"Jerry, what a surprise! I thought you sere out of town."
S02E10,JERRY,"Well, Leslie, sometimes the road less travelled is less travelled for a reason."
S02E10,ELAINE,"(Speaking confidentially to George) George, don't even think about it! Don't even dream about it!"

S02E10,LESLIE,Yeah?
S02E10,GEORGE,George.. (She doesn't seem to recognize him) George Costanza.
S02E10,LESLIE,Hi.
S02E10,GEORGE,"(Laughs) You, I guess, you don't remember me.. but we actually, kind of um.. went out.. a couple of years ago.. once.. remember?"
S02E10,LESLIE,Vaguely.
S02E10,GEORGE,You took me to one of your shows..
S02E10,LESLIE,And?
S02E10,GEORGE,"And, um, it was quite good. In fact, you even incorporated me into the show. I'm not actually a performer. Although, my parents felt I had talent.."
S02E10,MARY,"Jerry?! (A woman, angry at Jerry, approaches him. Jerry looks confused) Remember me?"
S02E10,JERRY,"I'm sorry, I.."
S02E10,MARY,"(Livid) Mary Contardi. No? Doesn't ring a bell, Jerry? We had a date, three years ago. You took me to one of your shows."
S02E10,JERRY,"(Stammering) Oh, I, I, think I remember.."
S02E10,MARY,Told me you had a great time! Said you'd call me the next day.
S02E10,JERRY,"Well, I'm sure I meant to call.. I probably just lost your.."
S02E10,MARY,"Liar! Liar! You were never going to call me! You thought you could waltz throught the rest of your life and never bump into me again! But you were wrong, Jerry! You were wrong! What do you think, I'm some sort of poor, pathetic wretch?!"
S02E10,JERRY,"No, I don't think that.."
S02E10,MARRY,Some person who could be dismissed and ignored?! Some insignificant piece of dust?! Some person who doesn't deserve your respect and your attention?! You're the one that doesn't deserve my respect and my attention! You're the insignificant piece of dust!
S02E10,GEORGE,"Actually, I never had any formal training. I guess I'd be better suited for improvs, or something.."
S02E10,LESLIE,Thanks a lot!
S02E10,ELAINE,I'm sorry you have to go.
S02E10,WOMAN,Yeah. I really have to be going.
S02E10,JERRY,"Alright, listen, I've changed my mind about this whole thing. I don't want cable."
S02E10,KRAMER,Don't be a fool.
S02E10,TABACHNICK,You don't want?
S02E10,JERRY,"No, I don't want. So, just tell me what I owe you for your trouble.."
S02E10,TABACHNICK,"(Confers with his assistant, then) Four hundred dollars."
S02E10,JERRY,(To Kramer) Four hundred dollars?1 You told me one-fifty!
S02E10,LESLIE,I'm going.. obviously.
S02E10,ELAINE,"Oh, Leslie, I am so sorry about everything that went on here tonight. You know, I had no idea.."
S02E10,LESLIE,"Elaine, you know, I was watching you tonight, and I realized something. You're just like you were in college."
S02E10,ELAINE,"(Not sure if it was an insult or a compliment) Oh, thank you. (Leslie leaves. Then Elaine wonders to herself) ""Like you were in college""?"
S02E10,LESLIE,"(Comes back, and yells in the direction of the bedroom) Come on! Let's go!"
S02E10,GEORGE,(Sheepishly to Elaine) I'll be right back. (Leaves)
S02E10,JERRY,(Defiantly) I'm not paying four hundred dollars! I don't even want the thing. What are you going to do?!

No matter what you say, it's a lie. ""I'll see you around. See you around. If you're around, and I'm around, I'll see you around that area. You'll be around other people. You won't be around me. But you will be around."" ""Take care now."" Did you ever say that to somebody? ""Take care now. Take care, now. Because, I'm not going to be taking care of you. So, you should take care, now.""

I like to let it ring a few times, you know, let her sweat a little over there, then I just pick it up, ""Yeah, operator... oh, I got the money... I got the money right here... D'you hear that? (taps on microphone) That's a quarter. Yeah, you want that don't you?"""
S02E11,ELAINE,"No, they've just got to get more cops on the force, it's as simple as that."

S02E11,JERRY,"I tell you what they should do, they should combine the two jobs, make it one job, 'cop\garbage man'. I always see cops walking around with nothing to do. Grab a broom! Start sweeping. You sweep sweep sweep... catch a criminal, get right back to sweeping."
S02E11,ELAINE,You should run for mayor.

S02E11,ELAINE (to Jerry),How many?
S02E11,JERRY (to George),Is Tatiana coming?
S02E11,GEORGE,"I don't know, I have to call her, tell her where we are. I'm very lucky she's even considering seeing me at all."
S02E11,JERRY,Really? I thought things were going OK.
S02E11,GEORGE,"They were, it's kinda complicated."
S02E11,JERRY,Well what is it?
S02E11,ELAINE,How many?
S02E11,JERRY,"Ah, alright, four. Seinfeld."
S02E11,BRUCE,"Four. It'll be five, ten minutes."

S02E11,ELAINE,You mean lying to your uncle?

S02E11,ELAINE,"Jerry, get menus so when we sit down we can order right away."
S02E11,JERRY,"Can't look at a menu now, I gotta be at the table."
S02E11,GEORGE,He knows I'm waiting. He sees me. He just doesn't wanna look.
S02E11,ELAINE,"Everything's gotta be just so with you, doesn't it?"
S02E11,JERRY,"Hey, I offered you those cookies in my house."
S02E11,ELAINE,Health cookies. I hate those little dustboard fructose things.
S02E11,GEORGE,I just can't believe at the way people are. What is it with humanity? What kind of a world do we live in?
S02E11,ELAINE,What?
S02E11,JERRY,"There's a woman over there that looks really familiar. Dark hair, striped shirt?"
S02E11,ELAINE,I've never seen her before.
S02E11,JERRY,I know this woman. This is gonna drive me crazy.
S02E11,MAN,"Oh, Excuse me."
S02E11,ELAINE,I'm sorry.
S02E11,ELAINE,"Didja see that? Those people, look, they're getting a table."
S02E11,JERRY,Well maybe they were here from before.
S02E11,ELAINE,"No no no, they weren't here before."
S02E11,GEORGE (to guy),"Excuse me, are you going to be much longer? I have to make a very important call."
S02E11,ELAINE,Find out what's going on!
S02E11,JERRY,"Excuse me, didn't those people just come in? I believe we were ahead of them."

S02E11,BRUCE,"No, no, they were here before. Keckitch(sp?), 2!"

S02E11,GEORGE (whistles to guy on phone),Hey!
S02E11,GEORGE,"If anything happens here, can I count on you?"

S02E11,GEORGE,If we decide to go at it.
S02E11,JERRY,"Yeah, I wanna get into a rumble..."
S02E11,GEORGE,"I have to get in touch with Tatiana! And look at his little outfit. It's all so coordinated, the way his socks matching to his shirt. I really hate this guy."

S02E11,JERRY,"George, who is that woman in the stripes?"
S02E11,GEORGE,I don't know her.
S02E11,JERRY,She looks so familiar.
S02E11,ELAINE,"Ya know, its not fair people are seated First Come First Served, It should be based on who's hungriest. I feel like just going over there and taking some food off somebody's plate."
S02E11,JERRY,"I'll tell you what, there's 50 bucks in it for you if you do it."
S02E11,ELAINE,What do you mean?
S02E11,JERRY,"You walk over that table, you pick up an eggroll, you don't say anything, you eat it, say 'thank you very much', wipe your mouth, walk away- I give you 50 bucks."
S02E11,GEORGE,What are they gonna do?
S02E11,JERRY,"They won't do anything; in fact, you'll be giving them a story to tell for the rest of their lives."
S02E11,ELAINE,"50 bucks, you'll give me 50 bucks?"
S02E11,JERRY,"50 bucks. That table over there, the three couples."
S02E11,ELAINE,"OK, I don't wanna go over there and do it, and then come back here and find out there was some little loophole, like I didn't put mustard on it or something..."
S02E11,JERRY,"No, no tricks."
S02E11,ELAINE,"Should I do it, George?"
S02E11,GEORGE,For 50 bucks? I'd put my face in the soup and blow.
S02E11,ELAINE,"Alright, alright. Here, hold this. I'm doin' it."
S02E11,ELAINE (through her teeth),"I know this sounds crazy, but the two men who are standing behind me are going to give me 50 bucks if I stand here and eat one of your eggrolls."
S02E11,ELAINE (through teeth),I'll give you 25 if you let me do it.
S02E11,PEOPLE AT TABLE,What? What is she talking about? What did she say?
S02E11,JERRY,What happened?
S02E11,ELAINE,Did you see that?
S02E11,GEORGE,What were you doing?
S02E11,ELAINE (laughing),"I offered them 25, they had no idea..."

S02E11,WOMAN AT PHONE,Where? I didn't see you.
S02E11,GEORGE,I've been standing here for the last ten minutes!
S02E11,WOMAN,Well I won't be long.
S02E11,GEORGE,That's not the point. The point is I was here first.
S02E11,WOMAN,"Well if you were here first, you'd be holding the phone."
S02E11,GEORGE (yelling at her),"You know, we're living in a society! We're supposed to act in a civilized way."
S02E11,GEORGE,Does she care? No. Does anyone ever display the slightest sensitivity over the problems of a fellow individual? No. No. A resounding no!
S02E11,GUY,"Hey, sorry I took so long."
S02E11,GEORGE,"Oh that's OK, really, don't worry about it."
S02E11,ELAINE,"How do people fast? Did Ghandi get this crazy? I'm gonna walk around, see what dishes look good."
S02E11,JERRY,I told my uncle I had a stomach ache tonight. You think he bought that?
S02E11,GEORGE,"Yeah, well, he probably bought it."
S02E11,JERRY,So what happened with Tatiana?
S02E11,GEORGE,I shouldn't even tell you this.
S02E11,JERRY,Come on...
S02E11,GEORGE,"Well, after dinner last week, she invites me back to her apartment."
S02E11,JERRY,I'm with you.
S02E11,GEORGE,"Well, it's this little place with this little bathroom. It's like right there, you know, it's not even down a little hall or off in an alcove. You understand? There's no... buffer zone. So, we start to fool around, and it's the first time, and it's early in the going. And I begin to perceive this impending... intestinal requirement, whose needs are going to surpass by great lengths anything in the sexual realm. So I know I'm gonna have to stop. And as this is happening I'm thinking, even if I can somehow manage to momentarily... extricate myself from the proceedings and relieve this unstoppable force, I know that that bathroom is not gonna provide me with the privacy that I know I'm going to need..."
S02E11,JERRY,This could only happen to you.
S02E11,GEORGE,"So I finally stop and say, ""Tatiana, I hope you don't take this the wrong way, but I think it would be best if I left""."
S02E11,JERRY,You said this to her after.
S02E11,GEORGE,No. During.
S02E11,JERRY,"Oh, boy."
S02E11,GEORGE,Yeah.
S02E11,JERRY,Wow! So...?
S02E11,GEORGE,"So I'm dressing and she's staring up at me, struggling to compute this unprecedented turn of events. I don't know what to say to reassure this woman, and worst of all, I don't have the time to say it. The only excuse she might possibly have accepted is if I told her I am in reality Batman, and I'm very sorry, I just saw the Bat-Signal. It took me 3 days of phone calls to get her to agree to see me again. Now she's waiting for me to call her, and she's"
S02E11,ELAINE,"I hate this place. I don't know why we came here, I'm never coming back here again."
S02E11,JERRY (still trying to remember),Who is that woman?!
S02E11,ELAINE,"Remember when you first went out to eat with your parents? Remember, it was such a treat to go and they serve you this different food that you never saw before, and they put it in front of you, and it is such a delicious and exciting adventure? And now I just feel like a big sweaty hog waiting for them to fill up the trough."
S02E11,GEORGE,She's off. (goes over to the now available public phone)
S02E11,ELAINE,"Jerry, talk to that guy again."
S02E11,JERRY,What am I gonna say?
S02E11,ELAINE,Tell him we wanna catch a movie and that we're late.
S02E11,MR. COHEN,"Hey, what stinks in here?"
S02E11,Bruce (laughing),Mr. Cohen! Haven't seen you for a couple of weeks.
S02E11,MR. COHEN,"Well, I've been looking for a better place."
S02E11,BRUCE,Better place... Want a table?
S02E11,MR. COHEN,"No, just bring me a plate and I'll eat here."
S02E11,BRUCE (laughing),"Give him a plate and you eat here... Come on, I give you a table."
S02E11,JERRY,"Excuse me... we've been waiting here. Now, I KNOW we were ahead of that guy, he just came in."
S02E11,BRUCE,"Oh no, Mr. Cohen always here."
S02E11,ELAINE,He's always here? What does that mean? What does that mean?
S02E11,BRUCE,"Oh, Mr. Cohen, very nice man. He live on Park Avenue."
S02E11,ELAINE,Where am I? Is this a dream? What in God's name is going on here?!
S02E11,GEORGE,She's not there. She left. She must've waited and left because those people wouldn't get off the phone.
S02E11,JERRY,Didja leave a message?
S02E11,GEORGE,"Yeah, I told her to call me here and to tell anyone who answers the phone to ask for a balding, stocky man with glasses. I better tell him I'm expecting a call."
S02E11,ELAINE,"Oh, Jerry, here comes that woman..."
S02E11,JERRY,Where do I know her?
S02E11,LORRAINE,"Hello, Jerry!"
S02E11,JERRY,Heeeeyyyy... How you doin'?
S02E11,LORRAINE,How is everything?
S02E11,JERRY,"Good, good, good... What's goin' on?"
S02E11,LORRAINE,"Oh, working hard. And you?"
S02E11,JERRY,"Oh, you know, working around, same stuff, doing... whatever."
S02E11,LORRAINE,You haven't been around in a while.
S02E11,JERRY,"I know, I know... Well, you know."
S02E11,LORRAINE,You should come by.
S02E11,JERRY,"Definitely. I plan to, I'm not just saying that."
S02E11,ELAINE,"Hi, I'm Elaine."
S02E11,LORRAINE (shaking her hand),Lorraine. Catalano.
S02E11,JERRY,"I'm sorry, Lorraine, this is Elaine..."
S02E11,LORRAINE,"Well it was nice seeing you, Jerry. And nice meeting you. (she leaves)"
S02E11,ELAINE (smug),"Oh, nice to meet you too, Lorraine!"
S02E11,JERRY,"Oh my god, Lorraine... that's Lorraine from my uncle's office. I'm in big, big trouble."
S02E11,ELAINE,The one you broke the plans with tonight?
S02E11,JERRY,"Yeah, she works in his office. Now she's gonna see him tomorrow and tell him she saw me here tonight. He's gonna tell his wife, his wife's gonna call my mother. Oh, this is bad, you don't know, the chain reaction of calls this is gonna set off. New York, Long Island, Florida, it's like the Bermuda Triangle. Unfortunately, nobody ever disappears. My uncle to my aunt, my aunt to my mother, my mother to my uncle..."
S02E11,JERRY,"...My uncle to my cousin, my cousin to my sister, my sister to me."
S02E11,ELAINE,You should've just had dinner with your uncle tonight and gotten in over with. It's just a movie.
S02E11,JERRY,"Just a movie?! You don't understand. This isn't 'Plans 1 through 8 from Outer Space', this is 'Plan 9', this is the one that worked. The worst movie ever made!"
S02E11,JERRY,"Hey, I got news for you, if we're making this movie, we gotta get a table immediately."
S02E11,ELAINE,"Alright, OK. Let's stop fooling around. Let's just slip him some money."
S02E11,JERRY,In a Chinese restaurant? Do they take money?
S02E11,ELAINE,"Do they take money? Everyone takes money. I used to go out with a guy who did it all the time, you just slip him 20 bucks."
S02E11,GEORGE,20 bucks? Isn't that excessive?
S02E11,ELAINE,"Well what do you want to give him, change?"
S02E11,GEORGE,It's more than the meal!
S02E11,JERRY,"Oh, come on, We'll divide it up three ways."
S02E11,GEORGE,"Alright. 7,7, (points at himself) 6. I'm not gonna eat that much!"
S02E11,JERRY,"I'm counting your shrimps. OK, Who's gonna do it?"
S02E11,GEORGE,"Oh no, I can't do it. I-I'm not good at these things, I get flustered. Once I tried to bribe an usher at the roller derby, I almost got arrested."
S02E11,ELAINE,"I guess it's you, Jer."
S02E11,JERRY,Me? What about you?
S02E11,ELAINE,"Oh, I can't do that, it's a guy thing."
S02E11,JERRY,"The woman's movement just can't seem to make any progress in the world of bribery, can they?"
S02E11,ELAINE,Give me the money.
S02E11,ELAINE,How's it going'?
S02E11,BRUCE,Very busy.
S02E11,ELAINE,"Boy, we are REALLY anxious to sit down."
S02E11,BRUCE,Very good specials tonight.
S02E11,ELAINE,If there's anything you can do to get us a table we'd really appreciate it.
S02E11,BRUCE,What is your name? (he turns the page over the money)
S02E11,ELAINE,"No no, I want to eat now! (she gets the money from under the page)"
S02E11,BRUCE,"Yes, we have sea-bass dinner tonight, very fresh."
S02E11,ELAINE (Gives him the money),"Here, take this. I'm starving. Take it! Take it!"
S02E11,BRUCE,"Dennison, 4! (goes over to 4 ladies) Your table is ready."
S02E11,ELAINE,"No no, no, I want that table. I want that table! Oh, come on, did you see that? What was that? He took the money, he didn't give us a table."
S02E11,JERRY,You lost the 20.
S02E11,ELAINE,"Well, how could he do that?"
S02E11,GEORGE,You didn't make it clear.
S02E11,ELAINE,Make it clear?
S02E11,JERRY,"What a sorry exhibition that was. Alright, let me get the money back."
S02E11,BRUCE,Your name?
S02E11,JERRY,Seinfeld.
S02E11,BRUCE,"Yeah, Seinfeld 4!"
S02E11,JERRY,"No no no, you see the girl there, with the long hair?"
S02E11,BRUCE,"Oh yes, yes. Very beautiful girl, very beautiful. Is your girlfriend?"
S02E11,JERRY,"Well, actually, we did date for a while, but... it's really not relevant here."
S02E11,BRUCE,Relationships are difficult. It's very hard to stay together-
S02E11,JERRY,"Alright, listen, alright. How much longer is it gonna be?"
S02E11,BRUCE,"Oh. In about five, ten minutes."
S02E11,GEORGE,So?
S02E11,JERRY,There seems to be a bit of a discrepancy.
S02E11,ELAINE,So when are we gonna eat?
S02E11,JERRY,"Five, ten minutes."
S02E11,GEORGE,We should have left earlier. I told you.
S02E11,JERRY,I don't see any way we can eat and make this movie.
S02E11,ELAINE,"Oh, well I have to eat."
S02E11,JERRY,"Well let's just order to go, we'll eat it in the cab."
S02E11,ELAINE,Eat it in the cab? Chinese food in a cab?
S02E11,JERRY,We'll eat it in the movie.
S02E11,ELAINE,"Oh, who do you think you're going? Do you think that they have big picnic tables there?"
S02E11,JERRY,Well what do you suggest?
S02E11,ELAINE,"I say we leave now, we go to 'Skyburger' and we scarf 'em down."
S02E11,JERRY,"I'm not going to 'Skyburger'. Besides, it's in the opposite direction, let's just eat popcorn or something."
S02E11,BRUCE (holding a phone),Cartwright?
S02E11,ELAINE,I can't have popcorn for dinner!
S02E11,BRUCE,Cartwright?
S02E11,ELAINE (tries to snatch food off a waiter's tray),I have to eat!
S02E11,JERRY,So they have hotdogs there.
S02E11,ELAINE,"Oh, movie hotdogs! I rather lick the food off the floor."
S02E11,GEORGE,"I can't go anywhere, I have to wait here for Tatiana's call. Let me just check."
S02E11,GEORGE,"Excuse me, I'm expecting a call. Costanza?"
S02E11,BRUCE,"Yeah, I just got a call. I yell 'Cartwright! Cartwright!', just like that. Nobody came up, I hang up."
S02E11,GEORGE,"Well, was it for Costanza or..."
S02E11,BRUCE,"Yes, yes, that's it. Nobody answered."
S02E11,GEORGE,Well was it a woman?
S02E11,BRUCE,"Yeah, yeah. I tell her you not here, she said curse word, I hang up."
S02E11,GEORGE,She called. He yelled Cartwright. I missed her.
S02E11,JERRY,Who's Cartwright?
S02E11,GEORGE,I'm Cartwright!
S02E11,JERRY,You're not Cartwri-
S02E11,GEORGE,"Of course I'm not Cartwright! Look, why don't you two just go to the movies all by yourselves, I'm not in the mood."
S02E11,ELAINE,"Well me neither, I'm goin' to 'Skyburger'."
S02E11,JERRY,So You're not going?
S02E11,ELAINE,You don't need us.
S02E11,JERRY,"Well I can't go to a bad movie by myself. Who am I gonna make sarcastic remarks to, strangers? Eh, I guess I'll just go to my uncle's."
S02E11,GEORGE,Should we tell him we're leaving?
S02E11,ELAINE,What for? Let's just get out of here.
S02E11,BRUCE,"Seinfeld, 4?"
S02E11,JERRY,"Hunger will make people do amazing things. I mean, the proof of that is cannibalism. Cannibalism, what do they say, I mean, they're eating and, you know, ""This is good, who is this? I like this person"". You know, I mean, I would think the hardest thing about being a cannibal is trying to get some very deep sleep, you know what I mean? I would think, you'd be like, (pretending to wake up) ""Who is that? Who's there? Who's there? Is somebody there? What do you want? What do you want? You look hungry, are you hungry? Get out of here!"""
S02E12,[Setting,Night club]
S02E12,JERRY,"I'm not a foodie. I don't, ""Oh, this is too rare. Oh, it's too salty."" Just eat it and shut up. I'll eat anywhere, whatever they're having. I have eaten rotten rolls off of room service trays in hotel hallways. I have. It's not a joke. This is my life. I don't know, somebody left it. Why would someone poison a roll, and leave it in a hallway for some comic coming down at two o' clock in the morning? Why would they do that? Sometimes you go to a nice restaurant, they put the check in a little book. What is this? The story of the bill? ""Once upon a time, there were some very hungry people.."" What is this? A little gold tassle hanging down? Am I graduating from the restaurant? What is this about?"
S02E12,[Setting,A restaurant]
S02E12,ELAINE,Do you want some of mine?
S02E12,JERRY,Take some of mine.
S02E12,GEORGE,"Why do I get pesto? Why do I think I'll like it? I keep trying to like it, like I have to like it."
S02E12,JERRY,Who said you have to like it?
S02E12,GEORGE,"Everybody likes pesto. You walk into a restaurant, that's all you hear - pesto, pesto, pesto."
S02E12,JERRY,I don't like pesto.
S02E12,GEORGE,Where was pesto 10 years ago?
S02E12,JERRY,"(Gesturing to a man) Look at that guy. (Elaine starts to look, but Jerry stops her) I'll bet you he's gettin' hair transplants. Any time you see a guy that age wearing a baseball cap, ten to one - plugs."
S02E12,ELAINE,"(Elaine turns to look at the man, trying to make it sound like they aren't talking about him) The thing about that painting.. is with the colors and um.. (Turns back to Jerry) Oh yeah, plugola."
S02E12,JERRY,"(To Elaine) Oh, one more thing about the car. Let it warm up for a minute."
S02E12,GEORGE,That's a tough minute. It's like waiting in the shower for the conditioner to work.
S02E12,JERRY,I don't understand why he couldn't take a cab.
S02E12,GEORGE,Who?
S02E12,JERRY,"Elaine is having a ""houseguest."" She's picking him up at the airport tonight."
S02E12,GEORGE,A guy?
S02E12,ELAINE,"(Slightly embarrassed) Yes, a guy."
S02E12,JERRY,"He's from a.. Yakima, right?"
S02E12,ELAINE,Seattle.
S02E12,JERRY,Everybody's moving to Seattle.
S02E12,GEORGE,It's the pesto of cities. So..?
S02E12,ELAINE,(To Jerry) You tell him.
S02E12,JERRY,"Well, from what I can piece together, our friend here met a gentleman."
S02E12,ELAINE,Ed.
S02E12,JERRY,"Who was in town on a business venture, and um.."
S02E12,ELAINE,..We shared an interpersonal experience. (George hits his glass with his fork. To Jerry) Go on.
S02E12,JERRY,"So they went out a few times, but apparently, when the fellow returned home, he discovered that the Benes tattoo does not wash off so easily."
S02E12,ELAINE,On some people.
S02E12,GEORGE,Oooh.
S02E12,JERRY,"So, he's coming in to stay with her for a week."
S02E12,ELAINE,"It was just gonna be a weekend, but then somehow it became a week."
S02E12,MANAGER,What happened?
S02E12,GEORGE,"Oh, the busboy left the menu a little close to the candle."
S02E12,MANAGER,Sorry to the disturbance.
S02E12,ELAINE,"(Joking, she snobbishly says) I'm never eating here again."
S02E12,JERRY,"(Pats George on the back) Nice going. Thank you, that ought to get us a free dessert.. (They can see the manager chewing the busboy out from the dining room doorway) I think the busboy's in trouble."
S02E12,GEORGE,Did I get him in trouble? Because of what I said?! I just told him what happened.. he didn't do it on purpose.. (Mangager and busboy are arguing. The busboy points in the direction of George) He pointed at me. Why did he point at me?!
S02E12,ELAINE,"I said I would never eat here again.. But, I, I.. he had to know I was kidding."
S02E12,JERRY,"(Casually buttering a roll, like he's the innocent one) I didn't say anything."
S02E12,GEORGE,I can't believe it. He's going! He's fired!
S02E12,ELAINE,"Oh, I said it in a kidding way."
S02E12,GEORGE,I didn't know he'd get fired.
S02E12,JERRY,(Jokingly trying to put more pressure on Elaine and George) He'll probably kill his family over this.
S02E12,GEORGE,What if he's waiting for me outside? He pointed at me! Did you see him point?!
S02E12,JERRY,"(Again, joking) A lot of ex-cons become busboys. They seem to gravitate twards 'em."
S02E12,GEORGE,Was it my fault?
S02E12,ELAINE,Was it my fault?
S02E12,JERRY,(Doesn't have a care in the world) ..Maybe I'll try that pesto.
S02E12,[Setting,Jerry's apartment]
S02E12,JERRY,"Look, I feel bad for him too, but he'll get another job. I mean, let's face it, it's not a profession where you embellish your resume and undergo a series of grueling interviews."
S02E12,GEORGE,"(Eating a sandwich) Oh, like you really know busboys."
S02E12,JERRY,"Oh, like you do."
S02E12,GEORGE,"Hey, at least I was a camp waiter."
S02E12,JERRY,(Scoffing) Camp.
S02E12,GEORGE,It was a fat camp. Those kids depended on me.
S02E12,JERRY,Elaine?
S02E12,ELAINE,(Through intercom) Yeah.
S02E12,JERRY,Busboys are always changing jobs. That's the business. I know. I work with these guys. I tallk to them in the kitchen at the comedy clubs.
S02E12,GEORGE,Then why don't you try and get him another job?
S02E12,JERRY,"I'd love to, but I don't know anything about him. He could be one of those people that walks around the street pricking people with pins."
S02E12,ELAINE,"I don't know if you people are aware of this, but I am one clever chickadee."
S02E12,GEORGE,What? Did you get the busboy's number?
S02E12,ELAINE,"His phone's been disconnected, but I was able to obtain an address - 1324 Amsterdam Avenue, apartment 4D. (Hands George a card) Now, I did my job. (To Jerry) May I have the car keys, please?"
S02E12,GEORGE,How did you get all this?
S02E12,ELAINE,"Does the word ""charm"" mean anything to you?"
S02E12,JERRY,No. (George grabs his jacket) So now you're going to his apartment? I really think this is nuts.
S02E12,GEORGE,(Putting his jacket on) I'd like to apologize. I want to tell him I.. I.. didn't mean to get him in trouble.
S02E12,JERRY,"You, you're going now?"
S02E12,GEORGE,"Yeah, I want to see if there's anything I can do.. maybe get him another job.. maybe I'll hear of something."
S02E12,JERRY,Maybe the fat camp. (To Elaine) You're not going?
S02E12,ELAINE,"I would, but I have to pick up Ed at the airport."
S02E12,JERRY,I just don't think you should go alone. Can't you wait till after my set?
S02E12,GEORGE,It'll take to long.
S02E12,JERRY,Take the K-man. A little support..
S02E12,GEORGE,(Unsure) I don't a..
S02E12,KRAMER,Take me where? Where?
S02E12,[Setting,An apartment building hallway]
S02E12,GEORGE,"Look, I really appreciate your coming, but if you wouldn't mind - try not to say too much."
S02E12,KRAMER,What am I gonna say?
S02E12,GEORGE,I don't know.
S02E12,KRAMER,"Well, I'm not an idiot."
S02E12,GEORGE,Certainly not.
S02E12,KRAMER,Then we're cool.
S02E12,GEORGE,"Yeah.. yeah, we're - we're cool. (Knocks lightly. Kramer takes charge by knocking on the door louder. The busboy answers) Uh, I'm sorry to bother you, I was in the restaurant earlier and I was wondering if I could talk to you for a few minutes about what happened. (He gestures for them to come in. They obey) I hope I'm not interrupting anything. It's just that I think I may have - without realizing it - been responsible for getting you fired. (Nervously laughs) And.. and.. and I just want you to know that I didn't intend for that to happen."
S02E12,KRAMER,(Patting George on the shoulder) He's a hell of a guy.
S02E12,GEORGE,This is a guy I know.. Kramer.
S02E12,KRAMER,Habla espanol?
S02E12,GEORGE,(To himself) Oh my God.
S02E12,ANTONIO,Si.
S02E12,KRAMER,Como se dice.. waterbed?
S02E12,GEORGE,"(Interrupting) Anyway, I just wanted to let you know I'm really sorry that happened, and if I can help out in any way, I'll certainly be glad to do that. (Pause) Well, I guess that's about it."
S02E12,KRAMER,You got anything to drink? Agua?
S02E12,GEORGE,Oy uy uy.. (Antonio points to the sink) We really should get going.
S02E12,KRAMER,Let me get a glass of water. (Heads tward the sink)
S02E12,GEORGE,Hurry up.
S02E12,ANTONIO,(Notices that his cat is missing) Pequita? Pequita? (Starts to panic)
S02E12,KRAMER,His cat's gone.
S02E12,ANTONIO,"(Notes the door was left wide open) La puerta esta abierta. (Starts screaming) La puerta esta abierta! (To Kramer and George) Who left the door open? (Silence) Who left the door open?! (Kramer and George look at eachother) Come on, come on! Help me look! (All three head out the door to look)"
S02E12,[Setting,Antonio's apartment]
S02E12,KRAMER,"..You know, cats run away all the time. You know, my aunt, she had a cat. Ran away. Showed up three years later.. you never know. They got things in"
S02E12,GEORGE,"(Gestures for Kramer to shut up) Once again, Antonio, I can't even begin to say how deeply, deeply sorry I am about everything. The job, the cat.. (A lamp breaks) the lamp."
S02E12,KRAMER,The wire was sticking out.. (Fits the two broken pieces together) Yeah.
S02E12,GEORGE,"(Hands Antonio a card) Here's my card. I'm in real estate, so, if you're ever looking for something bigger, something nicer.. (Antonio is staring at him, angered) ..maybe not right now. Anyway.. (Extends his hand for a handshake. Antonio doesn't move)"
S02E12,KRAMER,"You oughta get that wire fixed. (They go to leave) I got the door. (Shuts the door, the broken lamp falls to the floor)"
S02E12,[Setting,Jerry's apartment]
S02E12,JERRY,"(On the phone) George, stop worrying about this guy. It wasn't your fault.. Come on, he's not stalking you."
S02E12,KRAMER,Hey.
S02E12,JERRY,(To Kramer) Hey. (To George) He doesn't even know where you live.. Who told you to give him your business card?.. (Intercom buzzes) That's Elaine. (Kramer buzzes her in. Jerry talks into the phone) Kramer.. (To Kramer) George wants to know when you want to look for the cat again.
S02E12,KRAMER,It's been a week. It's up to the cat now.
S02E12,JERRY,(Into phone) Kramer says it's up to the cat now. (To Kramer) It'll be on your conscience.
S02E12,KRAMER,Oh? How do you figure?
S02E12,JERRY,(Into phone) How do you figure? (To Kramer) 'Cause you're the one who left the door open.
S02E12,KRAMER,Why was I in charge of closing the door?
S02E12,JERRY,"(Into phone) Why was he in charge of closing the door? (Irritated at the phone message relay, to Kramer) 'Cause you came in after him!"
S02E12,KRAMER,So!
S02E12,JERRY,"(Into phone) So! (To Kramer - getting even more angry) So, the last person in should close the door!"
S02E12,KRAMER,Let me talk to him.
S02E12,JERRY,(To Kramer) Talk - call him from your house. (Elaine enters. Kramer leaves. To phone) He's calling you now.. okay. (Hangs up)
S02E12,ELAINE,Ed's downstairs. CAn I have the car keys?
S02E12,JERRY,No hello?
S02E12,ELAINE,"Got any asprin? (Finds some) Hello. Now, lookit, you guarantee this car will get me to the airport tomarrow? No problems?"
S02E12,JERRY,"Guarantee? ..Hey, it's a car."
S02E12,ELAINE,"Because if there's even the slightest chance of any problem at all, I don't want to take it - because if I don't get this guy on a plane to Seattle and out of my life, I'm gonna kill him, and everyone who tries to stop me."
S02E12,JERRY,"(Jokingly asking) So, did you have a nice week together?"
S02E12,ELAINE,I heard a little ping in the car last time. What was that ping?
S02E12,JERRY,There's no ping. Why are you so wacky?
S02E12,ELAINE,"Jerry, you cannot imagine how much I hate this guy.. and he hasn't even done anything! It's the situation. He's a wonderful guy, but I hate his guts!"
S02E12,JERRY,"So, you two been, uh.."
S02E12,ELAIEN,"No! I told him I've been having my period for the last five days! I'm sleeping all squished over on the edge of my bed.. But, I've only got fourteen hours to go. Nothing can go wrong now. I think I've taken care of everything. I've confirmed the plane reservation. I've checked the weather.."
S02E12,JERRY,What's your airport route?
S02E12,ELAINE,I've got it all mapped out - I'm taking the tunnel.
S02E12,JERRY,..What about the Van Wyck?
S02E12,ELAINE,"I spoke to a cab driver. For five bucks, he turned me on to the Rockaway Boulevard shortcut."
S02E12,JERRY,Oooh.
S02E12,ELAINE,"Now, lookit, this plane leaves at 1015. We're getting up at about eight. That gives us enough time, right?"
S02E12,JERRY,You still using that old alarm clock?
S02E12,ELAIEN,"Oh, no, no. I bought a new one today. It's got everything - it's got everything... If you oversleep more than ten minutes, a hand comes out and slaps you in the face."
S02E12,[Setting,Night club]
S02E12,JERRY,"Flying doesn't make me nervous - driving to the airport can make you very nervous because when you're flying, when you're getting on the plane, if you miss that plane, there's no alternative. On the ground, you have options. You have buses, you have taxis, you have trains. But, when you're taking a flight, if you miss it, that's it. No airline goes, ""Well, you missed the flight, we do have a cannon leaving in about ten minutes. Would you be interested in that? It's not a direct cannon, you have to change cannons after you land."" (Imitates cannon operator) ""I'm sorry, where you goin'? Chicago? (Cranks the cannon) Oh, Dallas? Alright, wait a second.. (Cranks cannon to Dallas) Dallas. That's about Dallas. Texas, anyway. You should hit Texas. Are you ready? Make sure you get out of the net immediately, because we shoot the luggage in right after you."""
S02E12,[Setting,Elaine's apartment]
S02E12,(Elaine and Ed are in bed. Elaine awakes to find out that it's 9,15 - they overslept. She gets frantic)
S02E12,ELAINE,(Trying to wake Ed up) Get up! The alarm clock didn't go off! (Shakes him) It's 915! You're gonna miss the plane! It's 915!
S02E12,ED,915?
S02E12,ELAINE,Yes! 915!
S02E12,ED,(Going back to sleep) We'll never make it. I'll leave tomarrow.
S02E12,ELAINE,"Tomarrow?! Are you crazy? No, now, now! Let's go! (Gets his suitcase from the closet, throws it on the bed, and frantically starts packing) You get dressed! Get dressed!"
S02E12,ED,Can I shower?
S02E12,ELAINE,Shower?! ARe you out of your mind?!
S02E12,ED,I gotta shower. I'll feel dirty all day.
S02E12,ELAINE,"Forget the shower! The shower's out. Move it! Put your clothes on! Put your clothes on! (Pulls out drawers of clothes, turning them over in the suitcase. He walks tward the door) Where are you going?"
S02E12,ED,The kitchen.
S02E12,ELAINE,The kitchen?!
S02E12,ED,I've got a bag of cashews in there.
S02E12,ELAINE,They're not making it! Let's get your pants on!
S02E12,ED,What's the big deal if we don't make it? I'll just go tomarrow or the next day.
S02E12,ELAINE,No! You have your ticket! You have to go now!
S02E12,ED,I'll never make it.
S02E12,ELAINE,Don't say that!
S02E12,ED,But it takes forty-five minutes to get there. That'll only leave me five minutes to get to the plane.
S02E12,ELAINE,Shut up and pack!
S02E12,ED,And what if I don't make the plane? You'll have already left. Then what will I do?
S02E12,ELAINE,You're talking too much!
S02E12,ED,Where's my sweater?
S02E12,ELAINE,What?!
S02E12,ED,My brown sweater.
S02E12,ELAINE,What? What sweater?
S02E12,ED,My brown sweater.
S02E12,ELAINE,You didn't bring a brown sweater.
S02E12,ED,I brought a brown sweater.
S02E12,ELAINE,"Here! Here! You want a brown sweater?! (Recahes into one of her drawers, and grabs a brown sweater, then packs it) You got a brown sweater!"
S02E12,ED,That's not mine. I can't take your sweater.
S02E12,ELAINE,"It's brown! (Takes clothes still on the hangers, and dumps them into the suitcase)"
S02E12,ED,What are you doing?!
S02E12,ELAINE,NO time for folding.. (Looks around) I think that's it. (Zips up the suitcase)
S02E12,ED,My shoes. You packed my shoes.
S02E12,ELAINE,"Shoes? Shoes?! Shoes?! Shoes weren't invented till the fourth century! People walked around for thousands of years without them! (Puts her coat on over her nightie. He picks up his suitcase, she grabs it from him, then pushes him out of her way) I got this. Let's go!"
S02E12,[Setting,Jerry's apartment]
S02E12,JERRY,Anywhere in the city?
S02E12,GEORGE,Anywhere in the city - I'll tell you the best public toilet.
S02E12,JERRY,Okay.. Fifty-fourth and Sixth?
S02E12,GEORGE,"Sperry Rand Building. 14th floor, Morgan Apparel. Mention my name - she'll give you the key."
S02E12,JERRY,Alright.. Sixty-fifth and Tenth.
S02E12,GEORGE,"(Scoffs) ARe you kidding? Lincoln Center. Alice Tully Hall, the Met. Magnificent facilities."
S02E12,ELAINE,"(Slow, as if remember a dream) I never new I could drive like that. I was going faster than I've ever gone before, and yet, it all seemed to be happening in slow motion. I was seeing three and four moves ahead, weaving in and out of lanes like an Olympic skier on a gold metal run. I knew I was challenging the very laws of physics. At Queens Boulevard, I took the shoulder. At Jewel Avenue, I used the median. I had it. I was there.. and then.. I hit the Van Wyck. They say no one's ever beaten the Van Wyck, but gentlemen, I tell you this - I came as close as anyone ever has. And if it hadn't been for that five-car-pile-up on Rockaway Boulevard, that numbskull would be on a plane for Seattle right now instead of looking for a parking space downstairs."
S02E12,KRAMER,..The busboy's coming! The busboy's coming!
S02E12,GEORGE,The busboy's coming?
S02E12,JERRY,You don't mean here?
S02E12,KRAMER,Yeah. I just buzzed him in. He's on his way up..
S02E12,GEORGE,He's coming up?! (Moves to the door) I'll check you out later.
S02E12,JERRY,Where are you going?
S02E12,GEORGE,I'm the one he wants! He's coming to settle the score.
S02E12,JERRY,(Trying to get George and Kramer out) No. You three all know each other. There's no point in me getting involved at this stage of the game.
S02E12,KRAMER,"No, he's not going to do anything. I guarantee it."
S02E12,GEORGE,"Oh, the hell with it. Let him kill me. I.."
S02E12,KRAMER,Antonio. In here!
S02E12,GEORGE,"(Nervous, his voice cracks) Hey, Antonio. How's it going?"
S02E12,ANTONIO,"Three nights ago, a gas main beneath the restaurant exploded, killing five people in my section, including the busboy who replaced me. If I am not fired that night because of you and your thoughtless, stupid, insensitive remarks, it would have been me. You saved my life. (Hugs him again)"
S02E12,GEORGE,"(Trying to be modest) Ah, come on.."
S02E12,ELAINE,(Into the intercom) Yeah?
S02E12,ED,It's Eddie.
S02E12,ELAINE,He's coming up. (Buzzes him in) He's coming up..
S02E12,ANTONIO,"And that very same night of the accident, while looking for Pequita, I found a job in a restaurant where they pay me almost twice what I was making before - and when I returned to the apartment, Pequita, perhaps frightened from the explosion, had miraculously returned. Well, but now, I must go, for today I am starting my new and wonderful job. And I am very late. Thank you, thank you, thank you all. (Leaves)"
S02E12,ED,"Hey, watch were you're going. You almost knocked my head off!"
S02E12,ANTONIO,"Hey, why don't you watch where you're going, okay? 'Cause you bumped into me!"
S02E12,ED,"Who do you think you're talking to, pal?"
S02E12,ANTONIO,"Hey, get your hands off me!"
S02E12,ED,Go to hell!
S02E12,[Setting,Coffee shop]
S02E12,JERRY,He'll get another job. He's a busboy!
S02E12,GEORGE,It won't for a while. At least not until after the cast comes off.
S02E12,JERRY,It was that fall down the stairs. That's what did it.
S02E12,GEORGE,That's not how it happened. It's when he fell on him with his knee.
S02E12,ELAINE,"Oh, that was awful. Poor Antonio. (Waiter hands Elaine two bags of food to go) ..Thanks."
S02E12,GEORGE,"So, much longer?"
S02E12,ELAINE,"Till when - till he goes back to Seattle, or till he can feed himself?"
S02E12,GEORGE,(Not wanting to make Elaine mad) I guess it's not important.
S02E12,ELAINE,Take care of yourselves. (Leaves)
S02E12,GEORGE,"I should probably get going too. If I don't feed Pequita by seven, she goes all over everything.. take it easy."
S02E12,JERRY,Yeah.. (Takes a bite of his sandwich as the waiter starts cleaning off the table) How ya doing?
S02E12,[Setting,Night club]
S02E12,JERRY,"First of all, I can't believe that people actually do fight. People have fist fights in life. I can't really believe that we have boxing either. It's really kind of an amazing thing. To me, the problem with boxing is - you have two guys having a fight that have no prior argument. Why don't they have the boxers come into the ring in little cars, drive around a bit, have a little accident? They get out, ""Didn't you see my signal?"" ""Look at that fender!"" ..Then you'd see a real fight."
S03E01,JERRY,"Evry-Every time somebody recommends a doctor, he's always the best. ""Oh, is he good?"" ""Oh, he's the best. This guy's the best."" They can't all be the best. There can't be this many bests. Someone's graduating at the bottom of these classes, where are these doctors? Is somewhere, someone saying to their friend, ""You should see my doctor, he's the worst. Oh yeah, he's the worst, he's the absolute worst there is. Whatever you've got, it'll be worse after you see him. No, he's just, he's a butcher. The man's a butcher."" And then there's always that, ""Make sure that you tell him that, you know, you know me."" Why? What's the difference? He's a doctor. What is it, ""Oh, you know Bob! Okay, I'll give you the real medicine. And everybody else, I'm giving Tic-Tacs."""
S03E01,JULIANNA,"...And usually for lunch I'll have a salad, and for dinner, I eat whatever I want."
S03E01,JERRY,What do you think the worst part of being blind is?
S03E01,JULIANNA,Excuse me?
S03E01,JERRY,"You know, if you were blind, what do you think the worst part of it would be?"
S03E01,JULIANNA,I don't know.
S03E01,JERRY,I think it would be not being able to tell if there was bugs in my food. How could you ever enjoy a meal like that? I'd constantly be feeling around with my lips and my tongue.
S03E01,JULIANNA,Well that's how my five-year old eats. He's a very picky eater.
S03E01,JERRY,You hear about that kid that was kidnapped the other day in Pennsylvania?
S03E01,JULIANNA,No.
S03E01,JERRY,"He was at a carnival with his mother. She goes to get a hot dog, next thing you know she turns around, boom, he's gone."
S03E01,JULIANNA,Oh.
S03E01,JERRY,"Imagine how sick a person has to be to do something like that. (she starts the quick hand chops on his back) And these people are all over the place. You never know who's crazy, I could be one of these people."
S03E01,JULIANNA (visibly uncomfortable),Have you seen any good movies?
S03E01,JERRY,Who takes care of your boy during the day?
S03E01,JULIANNA,We have a woman. Why?
S03E01,JERRY,No no. I'm just saying.
S03E01,JULIANNA,She had references.
S03E01,JERRY,"Oh I'm sure she did, I'm sure they're impeccable. I'm talking about the ones that forge `em."
S03E01,JERRY,(about the massage)You know I think this is really helping.
S03E01,JULIANNA,"I don't live near here, ya know!"
S03E01,JERRY,So she's giving me the massage and I'm just making conversation.
S03E01,ELAINE,I don't like to talk during a massage.
S03E01,JERRY,"Neither do I, but I do it for them. I figure they're bored."
S03E01,GEORGE,"Yeah, I do that too. I feel guilty about getting the pleasure. I feel like I don't deserve it so I talk. It stops me from enjoying it. There's nothing to eat in here."
S03E01,ELAINE,Oh! I forgot to tell you--
S03E01,JERRY,I'm in the middle of a story.
S03E01,ELAINE,"Oh, okay, go ahead."
S03E01,GEORGE,Why don't you ever go shopping?
S03E01,JERRY,Well its not like it's a really funny story or anything.
S03E01,ELAINE,What happened?
S03E01,JERRY,"Well so she mentioned that she had a son, and then for some reason, I launch into the story about the kid from Pennsylvania who was abducted."
S03E01,ELAINE,"Oh, wasn't that terrible?"
S03E01,JERRY,"Yes, it was."
S03E01,GEORGE,Not even an apple.
S03E01,ELAINE,"She doesn't want to hear that, that was stupid."
S03E01,JERRY,I know it was stupid.
S03E01,ELAINE,Really stupid. (she takes a big sip from her bottled water.)
S03E01,JERRY,"Hey, I just said it was stupid."
S03E01,GEORGE,What about this leftover Chinese food?
S03E01,JERRY,Take it.
S03E01,ELAINE,I can't believe you said that.
S03E01,JERRY,"Hey, would you stop it already?"
S03E01,ELAINE,"So, whatd she say?"
S03E01,JERRY,"I don't know, she actually seemed to get a little paranoid."
S03E01,GEORGE,"(he just took a bite of the Chinese food ) This is terrible. What is this, ginger? I hate ginger. I can't understand how anyone can eat ginger. (puts the container back in the refrigerator.)"
S03E01,ELAINE,I have a good masseuse you could go to.
S03E01,JERRY,"Nah, she's really good and she's not just a masseuse, she's a physical therapist. There's a big difference. She uses the ultrasound, it's a real medical procedure. In fact, if you get a doctor's note, it's covered by insurance."
S03E01,GEORGE,Physical therapy is covered by insurance?
S03E01,JERRY,Yeah.
S03E01,GEORGE,You don't have to pay for the massage?
S03E01,JERRY,Not if you have a doctor's note.
S03E01,ELAINE,So where do you get this note?
S03E01,JERRY,"Well I've never actually done it but if I really wanted to I could probably get one from my friend Roy, the dentist."
S03E01,GEORGE,"Right, your friend Roy."
S03E01,ELAINE,What's the name of this physical therapist?
S03E01,JERRY,"I'll tell you, but don't ask her anything about her kid, she a little off."
S03E01,GEORGE,And you don't have to pay.
S03E01,GEORGE,"We have a, three-o'clock appointments."
S03E01,RECEPTIONIST,"George and Elaine, right?"
S03E01,ELAINE,Right.
S03E01,RECEPTIONIST,"Could you fill these out for me please? And um, Elaine, you'll be seeing Julianna"
S03E01,ELAINE,(quietly) Ok.
S03E01,RECEPTIONIST,"And George, you'll be with Raymond."
S03E01,GEORGE,"Excuse me, did you say 'Raymond'?"
S03E01,RECEPTIONIST,Yes.
S03E01,GEORGE,"But, uh, Raymond is a man."
S03E01,RECEPTIONIST,That's right.
S03E01,GEORGE,I can't get a massage from a man.
S03E01,ELAINE,Why not?
S03E01,GEORGE,"What, are you crazy? I can't have a man touching me. Switch with me."
S03E01,ELAINE,"No, I don't want the man either."
S03E01,GEORGE,"What's the difference, you're a woman. They're supposed to be touching you."
S03E01,ELAINE,He'd just be touching your back.
S03E01,GEORGE,He'd just be touching your back too.
S03E01,ELAINE,"No, it could get sexual."
S03E01,GEORGE,"I know. That's the point. If it's gonna get sexual, it should get sexual with you."
S03E01,ELAINE,I wouldn't be comfortable.
S03E01,GEORGE,I would? What if something happens?
S03E01,ELAINE,What could happen?
S03E01,GEORGE,What if it felt good?
S03E01,ELAINE,It's supposed to feel good.
S03E01,GEORGE,I don't want it to feel good.
S03E01,ELAINE,Then why get the massage?
S03E01,GEORGE,Exactly!
S03E01,RAYMOND,George?
S03E01,GEORGE,Yes?
S03E01,RAYMOND,I'm Raymond. (with a big smile)
S03E01,GEORGE,Hello.(with not a big smile)
S03E01,RAYMOND,"Are you ready? (smiling, he looks at Elaine. She smiles back at him while looking all the way up there at the tall, handsome Raymond.)"
S03E01,RAYMOND,And then Julianna asked me if I wanted to join her here in the office.
S03E01,GEORGE,Really.
S03E01,RAYMOND,Use to be a flight attendant.
S03E01,GEORGE,Oh boy.
S03E01,RAYMOND,"Ya know, why don't ya, open those pants, it's gonna be a lot easier that way."
S03E01,RAYMOND,So what do you do?
S03E01,GEORGE,What?
S03E01,RAYMOND,"I said, 'What do you do?'."
S03E01,GEORGE,I-I don't know.
S03E01,RAYMOND,You don't know what you do?
S03E01,GEORGE,Nah.
S03E01,RAYMOND,"Ohh-ho, come on. Hey, you're very tense."
S03E01,GEORGE,"hu, Coffee. Too much coffee (nervous laughter)."
S03E01,RAYMOND,"Okay, just take off those pants now, and I'll work the hamstring."
S03E01,GEORGE,"Oh, the hamstrings fine."
S03E01,RAYMOND,But you wrote that it was tender. (holding the clip board)
S03E01,GEORGE,"I wrote. Pfft, *I* wrote."
S03E01,RAYMOND,I'll check it out. (makes a notation on the form)
S03E01,GEORGE,Are you sure?
S03E01,RAYMOND,"Yeah, take 'em off. (continues writing)"
S03E01,RAYMOND,How did you hurt this?
S03E01,GEORGE,I don't know.
S03E01,RAYMOND,You don't know?
S03E01,GEORGE,No.
S03E01,RAYMOND,But you just told me--
S03E01,GEORGE,Korea.
S03E01,RAYMOND,You hurt it in Korea?
S03E01,GEORGE,What?
S03E01,RAYMOND,The hamstring.
S03E01,GEORGE,Korea.
S03E01,RAYMOND,How?
S03E01,GEORGE,Hamstring.
S03E01,RAYMOND,How did you hurt the hamstring?
S03E01,GEORGE,Hotel.
S03E01,ELAINE,How'd it go? George?
S03E01,JERRY,"No appointments at all? Because my neck is still tight. What about Thursday? And Friday? Oh boy. Okay, thanks anyway."
S03E01,JERRY,What's with you?
S03E01,GEORGE,A... ah...
S03E01,JERRY,"Yes, A...?"
S03E01,GEORGE,A man gave me...
S03E01,JERRY,"Yes, a man gave you...?"
S03E01,GEORGE,"A man gave me... a massage. hu, hu"
S03E01,JERRY,So?
S03E01,GEORGE,"So he... had his hands and, uh, he was uh"
S03E01,JERRY,He was what?!
S03E01,GEORGE,He-he was uh touching and rubbing. (nervous laugh)
S03E01,JERRY,That's a massage.
S03E01,GEORGE,And then I took my pants off.
S03E01,JERRY,You took your pants off?
S03E01,GEORGE,For my hamstring.
S03E01,JERRY,Oh.
S03E01,GEORGE,"He got about uh, two inches from... there."
S03E01,JERRY,Really?
S03E01,GEORGE,I think it moved.
S03E01,JERRY,Moved?
S03E01,GEORGE,"It may have moved, I don't know."
S03E01,JERRY,I'm sure it didn't move.
S03E01,GEORGE,It moved! It was imperceptible but I-I felt it.
S03E01,JERRY,"Maybe it just wanted to change positions? You know, shift to the other side."
S03E01,GEORGE,"No, no. It wasn't a shift, I've shifted, this was a move."
S03E01,JERRY,"Okay, so what if it moved?"
S03E01,GEORGE,That's the sign! The test; if a - if a man makes it move.
S03E01,JERRY,"That's not the test. Contact is the test, if it moves, as a result of contact."
S03E01,GEORGE,You think it's contact? It has to be touched?
S03E01,JERRY,That's what a gym teacher once told me.
S03E01,KRAMER,Hey.
S03E01,JERRY,Hey.
S03E01,KRAMER,"I just saw Joe DiMaggio in Dinky Donuts. You know, I-I looked in there and there he was having coffee and a donut."
S03E01,JERRY,Joe DiMaggio? In Dinky Donuts?
S03E01,KRAMER,Yeah. Joe DiMaggio.
S03E01,JERRY,"No, I'm sorry, if Joe DiMaggio wants a donut, he goes to a fancy restaurant or a hotel. He's not sitting in Dinky Donuts."
S03E01,KRAMER,Well maybe he likes Dinky Donuts.
S03E01,GEORGE,I don't even like to sit next to a man on an airplane 'cause our knees might touch.
S03E01,JERRY,I can't see Joe DiMaggio sitting at the counter in little tiny filthy smelly Dinky Donuts.
S03E01,KRAMER,Why can't Joe DiMaggio have a donut like everyone else?
S03E01,JERRY,"He can have a donut,"
S03E01,KRAMER,Yeah.
S03E01,JERRY,but not at Dinky.
S03E01,GEORGE,"I don't even like to use urinals, always been a stall man."
S03E01,KRAMER,"Look I'm tellin-- (he does a double take and looks at George) I'm telling ya, that was Joe DiMaggio."
S03E01,GEORGE,"The guy slept with Marilyn Monroe, he's in Dinky Donuts. What about this doctor's note? Let's go see your friend Roy."
S03E01,JERRY,I never said I'd do that.
S03E01,GEORGE,"What are you talking about, that's seventy-five bucks! I'm not working, I can't afford that."
S03E01,JERRY,I don't know how I feel about it.
S03E01,GEORGE,"Oh, what are you, like, a Quaker now?"
S03E01,JERRY,"Alright, alright."
S03E01,KRAMER,"A stall man, huh? (small laugh)"
S03E01,GEORGE,All right -- (Gets up to leave)
S03E01,KRAMER,Wha-ha-a-at? (makes a gesture with his hand)
S03E01,JERRY,"...so we were just kinda wondering if it was possible for you to write us a note, and if you can't, believe me, it's fine."
S03E01,GEORGE,He didn't say he can't.
S03E01,JERRY,"I mean, if you feel funny about it, at all."
S03E01,GEORGE,He doesn't feel funny.
S03E01,JERRY,If he does.
S03E01,GEORGE,Do you feel funny? He didn't say anything.
S03E01,JERRY,He feels funny. You don't have to do this.
S03E01,GEORGE,He knows that!
S03E01,JERRY,"Roy, should we go? Is this a breach of our friendship?"
S03E01,GEORGE,"Oh, can you be any more dramatic?"
S03E01,ROY,"Don't be ridiculous. (Notices George looking at a poster on the wall) Holyfield. He's a good friend of one of my patients. He's got a hell of a body, doesn't he?"
S03E01,GEORGE,How would I know?
S03E01,ROY,Do you like him?
S03E01,GEORGE,"What do you mean, like him?"
S03E01,ROY,Do you like him?
S03E01,GEORGE,I mean he's a good fighter and a nice guy but I don't like him.
S03E01,ROY,How come you don't like him?
S03E01,GEORGE,Why should I?
S03E01,JERRY,What is the matter with you?
S03E01,GEORGE,"Nothing, why? You think something's wrong? Am I different?"
S03E01,ROY,"So, you want the notes?"
S03E01,JERRY,"You don't have to, really."
S03E01,ROY,"Nah nah, it's ok."
S03E01,JERRY,"We should probably get one for Elaine, too, right George? (turns to George, who is staring intently at the Holyfield poster) George?"
S03E01,JERRY,Well what about the week after?
S03E01,JERRY,No appointments at all? (motions to Elaine to move over)
S03E01,ELAINE,What? (he bumps her with his butt to move over)
S03E01,JERRY,"Can I - can I at least just talk to her so I can apologize? Forget it. (Hangs up) I can't believe this, I make one innocent comment, about some lunatic in Pennsylvania and I'm cut off. This woman is insane. (Looks at Elaine for a moment) What's with you?"
S03E01,ELAINE,What?
S03E01,JERRY,"Well you were too close to me, I was all scrunched in there."
S03E01,ELAINE,"Hey, you scrunched me. I sat down here first."
S03E01,KRAMER,"Hey, I saw DiMaggio in the donut shop again."
S03E01,JERRY,Uh huh.
S03E01,KRAMER,Yeah.
S03E01,ELAINE,Joe DiMaggio?
S03E01,KRAMER,"Joe DiMaggio, you know this time I went in and sat down across from him and I really watched him. I studied, his every move. For example, he dunks."
S03E01,ELAINE,Joe DiMaggio dunks his donut?!
S03E01,KRAMER,That's right.
S03E01,JERRY,"See, now I know it's not him. Joe DiMaggio could not be a dunker."
S03E01,KRAMER,"Oh, he's a dunker."
S03E01,ELAINE,Why couldn't he be a dunker?
S03E01,KRAMER,"And nothing diverts his attention. Like, I'm uh, you know, I-I, like I'm sitting in there, you know. And, uh, I start banging on the table, you know, to uh, so that hell look up, you know, Like I'm sitting there you know and uh, *bang* (slams the table) You know, *bang* He wouldn't move. So then I start doing these yelping noises. Like, *yip* (high pitched yelping noises) *yip*. No reaction because the guy is so focused, you see, he can just block out anything that's going on around him. See, that's how he played baseball. He dunks like he hits."
S03E01,ELAINE,So then what?
S03E01,KRAMER,"Well, then the waitress, she comes up and she tells me to shut up or they're gonna throw me out."
S03E01,ELAINE,Why didn't you just call out his name?
S03E01,JERRY,What happened to you?
S03E01,GEORGE,These kids called me a Mary.
S03E01,ELAINE,A what?
S03E01,GEORGE,"I was jumping over a puddle, and for some reason I went like this. (George stretches out his arms in a ballet motion) And they called me a Mary. So I chased them, and I tripped and I fell."
S03E01,KRAMER,"Yeah, you know kids, they can be very perceptive."
S03E01,ELAINE,"Hey, George? What is this? (laughing, Elaine makes the same outstretched arm motion) What is that? No really, what is that?"
S03E01,JERRY,"Hello? Oh, hi Roy. What? Oh my god. Wel-- how did this happen? What can I do? Oh. I am so sorry. Okay. Bye. (Hangs up) That was Roy. He's under investigation for insurance fraud."
S03E01,KRAMER (singing),"...just a man and not a freak, Joltin' Joe DiMaggio. Joe, Joe. Go, Joe..."
S03E01,JERRY,I told you.
S03E01,GEORGE,Told me what?
S03E01,JERRY,I told you we shouldn't do it.
S03E01,GEORGE,He didn't say anything.
S03E01,JERRY,"He's got a house, a family, they could take away his license. You should have heard him. Three notes, how stupid was that? We never should have got three notes."
S03E01,ELAINE,Three notes?
S03E01,JERRY,"Yeah, you, me and George."
S03E01,ELAINE,You got me a note?
S03E01,JERRY,Yeah.
S03E01,ELAINE,But I got my own note.
S03E01,JERRY,You what?
S03E01,ELAINE,I got a note from my gynecologist.
S03E01,JERRY,Why'd you do that?
S03E01,ELAINE,I didn't know you were getting me a note.
S03E01,JERRY,Of course I was getting you a note.
S03E01,ELAINE,But you didn't say anything. Ohhh
S03E01,JERRY,"Neither did you, that's how he got caught. We sent in four notes from two doctors."
S03E01,GEORGE,No Doctor--
S03E01,ELAINE,Wait a--
S03E01,KRAMER,"How can you do that to your friend? He's got a wife, kids, and a lot of other stuff. Oh, yyyeeah."
S03E01,JERRY,Hi Pam.
S03E01,PAM,Hello.
S03E01,GEORGE,Hello.
S03E01,JERRY,"I just thought ahh maybe I could talk to Roy, if um"
S03E01,ROY,"Pam, did the x-ray from Mrs. Sloan... Hi."
S03E01,JERRY,Hi Roy.
S03E01,GEORGE,How ya doing?
S03E01,ROY,"Come on back, I have a patient but she's under."
S03E01,JERRY,I don't even know what to say.
S03E01,GEORGE,Me neither.
S03E01,JERRY,I knew this would happen.
S03E01,GEORGE,Me too.
S03E01,JERRY,"I mean the whole thing, it's just..."
S03E01,GEORGE,Tragic.
S03E01,JERRY,Well it's not tragic.
S03E01,GEORGE,No?
S03E01,JERRY,"No, it's..."
S03E01,GEORGE,Unsettling?
S03E01,JERRY,"Okay. I mean, what if the--"
S03E01,PAM,I hope you're both happy. (she turns and walks away)
S03E01,JERRY,I'm not happy.
S03E01,GEORGE,Me neither. I've never been happy.
S03E01,JERRY,"I mean I'm happy sometimes, but-but not now."
S03E01,GEORGE,"In college, maybe. Those were fun times."
S03E01,JERRY,"Yeah, college was fun."
S03E01,GEORGE,Yeah.
S03E01,JERRY,Yeah.
S03E01,PAM,"You know the whole practice is in jeopardy, you know that? (she turns and walks away again.)"
S03E01,ROY,Don't mind her.
S03E01,JERRY,"Oh please, I love her."
S03E01,GEORGE,I've just met her but I'm very impressed.
S03E01,ROY,"I can't understand, I've never had a problem with these notes before."
S03E01,JERRY,"Well what's the next move, what's gonna happen now?"
S03E01,ROY,"Well, nothing really, as long as we get the physical therapist to go along with our story."
S03E01,JERRY,What? The physical therapist? Why?
S03E01,ROY,She just has to say the complaint was related to a dental problem.
S03E01,GEORGE,How ya doing?
S03E01,JERRY,"Hi. Ah look, I know I don't have an appointment but it's really important that I talk with Julianna."
S03E01,RECEPTIONIST,"I'm sorry, Mr. Seinfeld, she's not in."
S03E01,JERRY,"Yeah, I know she's mad at me, but I really have to speak with her."
S03E01,RECEPTIONIST,"I told you, she's not here."
S03E01,JERRY,"You don't understand, ah"
S03E01,RECEPTIONIST,"Look, you have to leave."
S03E01,JERRY,"Wait a second, don't you--"
S03E01,JERRY,"Hi. Hi. Look, I don't know what you think --"
S03E01,JULIANNA,Please!
S03E01,JERRY,"--but, you see, let me just talk to you for a second, see, what I did is inadvertently sent an insurance--"
S03E01,JULIANNA,"I treated you, so please, just get out of the office!"
S03E01,JERRY,Can't you just listen to me?
S03E01,JULIANNA (releasing her child),Run Billy! Run to the office and close the door! (to the receptionist) Call the police!
S03E01,JERRY,The police?
S03E01,RAYMOND,What is the --. Hi George. (stands there with a big smile)
S03E01,GEORGE,Hello.
S03E01,JERRY (to George),Raymond?
S03E01,ELAINE,"Well, I mean it's only a six month probation, it's a slap on the wrist."
S03E01,JERRY,"Yeah, I still don't see any dinner invitations forthcoming."
S03E01,GEORGE,"Men have been popping into my sexual fantasies. All of a sudden I'll be, in the middle."
S03E01,ELAINE,Of what?
S03E01,GEORGE,"And a guy will appear from out of nowhere. I say ""Get out of here! What do you want? You don't belong here!"""
S03E01,ELAINE,What do they do?
S03E01,GEORGE,"They talk back. They go, ""Hey George, how's it going?"" I say, ""Get the hell out of here!"""
S03E01,JERRY,"Hey, it's the K-man. (he bangs on the glass to get Kramer's attention, Elaine laughs) Maybe it's time you got a different hobby."
S03E01,KRAMER,"Man, Ughhhh, wwwheh. I just came from Roy's. I threw up from the gas."
S03E01,JERRY,Did he say anything?
S03E01,KRAMER,"No no, he's fine."
S03E01,JERRY (noticing something across the coffee shop),"Oh my god, it's..."
S03E01,GEORGE (looking over),Joe DiMaggio.
S03E01,ELAINE,(gasps)
S03E01,KRAMER,Where?
S03E01,JERRY,Having a cup of coffee.
S03E01,ELAINE,And he's dunking!
S03E01,KRAMER,Yeah -- yeah.
S03E01,JERRY,Wow. Look at him. The Yankee Clipper
S03E01,KRAMER,(quietly) yeah.
S03E01,JERRY,here.
S03E01,GEORGE,You see? Now that is a handsome man. (Elaine and Jerry look right at George) Oh please.
S03E01,KRAMER,"Wait, wait hold on now, wait, wait *bang* (he slams his hand down on the table, startling Jerry, Elaine and George) *bang* (again) *yip* (another high pitched yelping sound) *yip* *yip* See? I told you."
S03E01,JERRY,"What causes homophobia? What is it, that makes a heterosexual man, worry? I think it's because, men know, that deep down we have weak sales resistance. We're constantly buying shoes that hurt us, pants that don't fit right. Men think, ""Obviously I can be talked into anything. What if I accidentally wander into some sort of homosexual store, thinking it's a shoe store, and the salesman goes, 'Just hold this guy's hand, walk around the store a little bit, see how you feel. No obligation, no pressure, just try it. Would you like to see him in a sandal?'"""

S03E02,JERRY,"Welcome everyone to the room...Ah, the extra button....yeah ... what kind of a sicko would save these ...have them in a huge file, drawers that wide (small fingers opening imaginary drawers) Where the hell is that ... I mean is it THAT hard to get round black buttons that they have to make it into such a great thing like this? ... is it such a great jacket ... the buttons are so unique, so one of a kind, you'll never find them - they save you the trouble of knocking your brain off - and we know they're going to fall off too that's the other thing ..."
S03E02,PATRICE,Everyone in my family's creative. And even though I'm working as an accountant now I'd really like to eventually live exclusively on my pappe-ay mache-ay hats
S03E02,GEORGE,I don't understand. Paper Machay hats?
S03E02,PATRICE,uh uh
S03E02,GEORGE,What if it rains?
S03E02,PATRICE,They're art. You hang them on the wall.
S03E02,GEORGE,"Oh, art!"
S03E02,PATRICE,It's my creative outlet. One of my passions.
S03E02,GEORGE,Any money in it?
S03E02,PATRICE,"Who so belongs only to his age, references only popenjays and mumbo jumbos"
S03E02,GEORGE,"Of course, right."
S03E02,PATRICE,"Thomas Carlisle, 1864."
S03E02,GEORGE,Tommy C.
S03E02,JERRY,These are the receipts from 85 and I'm going to do 86.
S03E02,KRAMER,I'm sorry. I thought it was a legitimate charity. I didn't know you'd get audited
S03E02,JERRY,I don't blame you. I blame myself.
S03E02,KRAMER,"No, blame me."
S03E02,JERRY,"OK, I blame you."
S03E02,KRAMER,Don't blame me.
S03E02,JERRY,What was I supposed to do? You knew I was on my first date with Elaine. You come barging in here asking me to contribute money for a volcano relief fund for krakatoa.
S03E02,KRAMER,It was supposed to erupt.
S03E02,JERRY,I find the whole thing very embarrassing.
S03E02,KRAMER,You know what my feelings are about this. I don't even pay taxes.
S03E02,JERRY,"Yeah, tha's easy when you have no income."
S03E02,ELAINE,"Hi,"
S03E02,JERRY,Hi
S03E02,ELAINE,"Kramer, do me a favour will ya'. If you insist o making pasta in my apartment please don't put the tomato sauce on the pasta while it's in the strainer. All the little squares have hardened red sauce in them."
S03E02,ELAINE,What's so funny
S03E02,JERRY,Kramer dating your room mate. It's funny.
S03E02,ELAINE,"Uh, it's a riot Alice."
S03E02,KRAMER,When do you pit the sauce on?
S03E02,ELAINE,Any other time.
S03E02,KRAMER,I like to strain the sauce.
S03E02,ELAINE,And ... I could really live without the tribal music ... and the make out sessions in the living room
S03E02,KRAMER,"Yeah, Tina likes the couch."
S03E02,ELAINE,What are you doing? What is all this?
S03E02,JERRY,"Oh he's uh, helping me sort my receipts. I'm being audited."
S03E02,ELAINE,"O, your being auditted? What for?"
S03E02,JERRY,"Oh, I contributed money to a charity that turned out to be fraudulent. It's very boring."
S03E02,ELAINE,When was this?
S03E02,JERRY,"Uh, Along long time ago, in a galaxy far far away."
S03E02,ELAINE,I remember you donated to some volcano thing on our first date.
S03E02,JERRY,Volcano? Really?
S03E02,ELAINE,"Oh, wait a minute. Don't tell me that that was ..."
S03E02,JERRY,Something to drink?
S03E02,ELAINE,"What did you think, that would impress me?"
S03E02,JERRY,You got it ALL wrong. I was thinking only of the poor Krakatoans
S03E02,ELAINE,Like you this donation for 50 bucks and I'd start tearing my clothes off?
S03E02,JERRY,Those brave Krakatoans East of Java. who sacrifice so much for so long.
S03E02,ELAINE,Now you're being audited because of it. You see That's Karma.
S03E02,JERRY,"No, that's Krama."
S03E02,ELAINE,"So, waddya' going to do?"
S03E02,JERRY,It's all taken care of.
S03E02,ELAINE,How is that?
S03E02,KRAMER,(chuckles)
S03E02,JERRY,"An old friend of mine, whom you may have met, George Costanza, has recently become intimate with a female accountant who was formally a highly placed official with an outfit known as the IRS. And as we speak, at this very moment he is handing over to her all of my pertinent tax information. And she has assured us that the matter is well within her field of expertise."
S03E02,ELAINE,Why is she doing this?
S03E02,JERRY,I don't know. It must be love.
S03E02,GEORGE,I don't think we should see each other anymore. You're great but I'm I'm riddled with personal problems.
S03E02,PATRICE,What did I do?
S03E02,GEORGE,Nothing It's not you. It's me. I have a fear of commitment. I don't know how to love.
S03E02,PATRICE,You hate my earrings don't you?
S03E02,GEORGE,"No, no,"
S03E02,PATRICE,And you didn't comment on the chop sticks.
S03E02,GEORGE,"I love the chop sticks. I, I personally prefer a fork but they look very nice."
S03E02,PATRICE,You're not telling me the truth. I must have done something.
S03E02,GEORGE,I have a fear of intimacy
S03E02,PATRICE,Don't give me cliches. I have a right to know. What did I do wrong?
S03E02,GEORGE,Nothing. It's not YOU..
S03E02,PATRICE,I want the truth.
S03E02,GEORGE,"The truth. you want the truth? It is your earrings It is the chopsticks but it's so much more. You're pretentious. You call everyone by their full name You call my doorman, Sammy, ""Samuel"" but you didn't even say ""Samuel"" You went ""Sam - U- EL"" Papie-eh Mach-eh What is Papie-ay Mach-ay?"
S03E02,PATRICE,Keep goin'.
S03E02,GEORGE,"I, I think I made my point. I'm sorry if I was a little harsh."
S03E02,PATRICE,"No, I asked for the truth. Thank you for being so honest."
S03E02,GEORGE,"Can I uh, can I walk you back to work?"
S03E02,PATRICE,I prefer to go alone. How much do I owe?
S03E02,GEORGE,"Oh, please ... ... four dollars is f..."
S03E02,JERRY,... if this audit had happened to me and I didn't have this woman to help me I would have killed this man. I would have strangled the life out of him with my bare hands
S03E02,ELAINE,I don't blame ya'
S03E02,JERRY,Have you ever been through an audit?
S03E02,ELAINE,No.
S03E02,JERRY,"It's hell. It's the financial equivalent of a complete rectal examination. I would have killed this man. Torn him limb from limb, ripped the flesh right off his bones ..."
S03E02,JERRY,Yeah
S03E02,GEORGE,George
S03E02,JERRY,"Come up - Ah, there he is, the man himself, George Louis Costanza. Here I am about to go to the electric chair and my oldest friend is dating the governor"
S03E02,GEORGE,"My whole life has been a complete waste of time, (chuckle)"
S03E02,JERRY,And there's so much more to go.
S03E02,GEORGE,Now I know what I am supposed to do. It's so simple. Tell the truth That's all. Just tell the truth
S03E02,JERRY,So what happened? You gave her my tax papers? ... My papers?
S03E02,GEORGE,"Oh, oh, your papers"
S03E02,JERRY,What happened you didn't give her the papers?
S03E02,GEORGE,No. I did.
S03E02,JERRY,SO?
S03E02,GEORGE,...I broke up with her.
S03E02,JERRY,You what?
S03E02,GEORGE,I broke up with her.
S03E02,JERRY,I'm being audited! And you broke up with her?
S03E02,GEORGE,It's OK. It's fine. She'll do it. I'm sure she'll still do it.
S03E02,JERRY,Why will she still do it? She hates you now. People don't do you favors after you dump them.
S03E02,GEORGE,"Oh, no. We left on good terms."
S03E02,JERRY,How is that possible?
S03E02,GEORGE,"Because I uh, I told her the truth."
S03E02,JERRY,"Oh, my God."
S03E02,GEORGE,It's OK.
S03E02,JERRY,It's unheard of ...
S03E02,GEORGE,She asked me to.
S03E02,JERRY,So you lie! What did you tell her?
S03E02,GEORGE,I told her that she was pretentious.
S03E02,JERRY,Pretentious!? The woman has my tax papers. You told her she was pretentious? The IRS. They're like the MAFIA. They can take anything they want
S03E02,ELAINE,How would you like it if someone told YOU the truth?
S03E02,GEORGE,Like what? What could they say?
S03E02,ELAINE,There are plenty of things to say.
S03E02,GEORGE,"Like what? I'm bald? What is it specifically? Is, is there an odor I'm not aware of?"
S03E02,ELAINE,"George, please."
S03E02,GEORGE,Give me one.
S03E02,ELAINE,You sure?
S03E02,GEORGE,Yes.
S03E02,ELAINE,What?
S03E02,ELAINE,Forget it. You are very careful with money.
S03E02,GEORGE,I'm cheap? You think I'm CHEAP? How could you say that to me? I can't believe this. How could you say that to me?
S03E02,ELAINE,You asked me to.
S03E02,GEORGE,You should have lied.
S03E02,ELAINE,"HUH, so should you."
S03E02,JERRY,"OK, wait a second, wait a second, what happened to my papers?"
S03E02,GEORGE,(ignoring Jerry) I mean I'm not really working right now.
S03E02,ELAINE,I know.
S03E02,GEORGE,When I was working I spent baby.
S03E02,JERRY,"Yeah, I know champagne, limos, cigars. WHAT happened to the papers?"
S03E02,GEORGE,She put them in her pocketbook. I guess she took them with her.
S03E02,ELAINE,Pocketbook or a handbag?
S03E02,JERRY,Is that relevant? She TOOK them. Call her office.
S03E02,GEORGE,"Give me the phone. (dials) Yea, Hi I would like to speak to Patrice. ... what? ... oh really? ... oh, ok, thank you, ... (hangs up)"
S03E02,JERRY,What? What?
S03E02,GEORGE,She never came back from lunch.
S03E02,JERRY,This is no good. This is no good. Call her house.
S03E02,GEORGE,"(dials) Hi, are you OK? no, no,.. huh, (hangs up) She hung up."
S03E02,JERRY,Not good.
S03E02,GEORGE,All right. There's nothing to be worried about. She's just a little annoyed right now. Tomorrow I'll personally go over there. I'll apologize. I'll get the papers. Don't worry. Don't worry. (exits)
S03E02,JERRY,Not good
S03E02,KRAMER,"Yeah, it's a windshield."
S03E02,JERRY,I can see that. What's it for?
S03E02,KRAMER,I found it on the road.

S03E02,ELAINE,(from intercom) I just finished working out are you busy?
S03E02,JERRY,Come on up.
S03E02,KRAMER,Can you believe somebody threw this out? You know I'm going to make a coffee table out of this and surprise Tina.
S03E02,JERRY,"wouldn't it be invisible? I mean, what, are you going to just sense it's in front of the couch?"

S03E02,ELAINE,"Huh, go ahead, tell him."
S03E02,KRAMER,"I, I saw her naked."
S03E02,ELAINE,"He saw me naked. Kramer, ... saw me naked."
S03E02,KRAMER,"Well, you know, ... it was an accident."
S03E02,ELAINE,Who walks into a woman's bedroom without knocking. I want to know!
S03E02,KRAMER,I thought it was a closet.
S03E02,JERRY,Completely naked?
S03E02,KRAMER,Completely naked.
S03E02,ELAINE,"Jerrryyy, How can I go on?"
S03E02,KRAMER,All right. I'll tell you what. If it's going to make you feel any better you can see me naked.
S03E02,ELAINE,No thanks!
S03E02,KRAMER,"No, I want you to see me naked."
S03E02,ELAINE,"No, no no."
S03E02,KRAMER,"No, I want to show you."
S03E02,ELAINE,No! Jerry! Jerry!
S03E02,JERRY,"OK, just a second lets not lose our heads here. Kramer you know you are always welcome in my home but as far as Mr. Johnson is concerned, that's another story."
S03E02,ELAINE,What is this?
S03E02,KRAMER,"Well, it's a windshield. It's going to be your new coffee table."
S03E02,ELAINE,"Ah, I'm going to kill myself on that thiing. You can't even see it."
S03E02,JERRY,You'll sense it.
S03E02,JERRY,"Well, what happened? Was she there?"
S03E02,GEORGE,"No, no she wasn't."
S03E02,JERRY,You didn't get my papers?
S03E02,GEORGE,"No, I didn't."
S03E02,JERRY,"Well, where is she?"
S03E02,GEORGE,A mental institution.
S03E02,JERRY,"Why is it so difficult, uncomfortable, to be naked. It's because when you have clothes on you can always kinda make those little adjustments which people like to do ... you feel like you're getting it together, yeah, yeah pretty good (pulling at lapels, pockets etc.) feeling good looking good But when you're naked it's like it's so final you're, Well that's it. (no movements) There's nothing else I can do. That's why I like to wear a belt when I'm naked. Cause I feel it gives me something, I know I'm naked, but you know, (tugging and lifting belt) I like to get pockets to hang off of the belt that would be, wouldn't that be the ultimate? To be naked and still be able to do this (hand in pocket) I think that would really help a lot."
S03E02,JERRY,A mental institution?
S03E02,KRAMER,You know what they do in there? Did you see CooCoo's Nest? They put those electrodes in your head.
S03E02,GEORGE,"It's not really a mental institution. It's more like a depression clinic. She went out to Woodhaven and checked herself in. I'm, I'm sick over this."
S03E02,ELAINE,Who told you this
S03E02,GEORGE,Her roommate. I've driven women to lesbianism before but never to a mental institution.
S03E02,KRAMER,"My friend Bob Sacamano had shock treatments. But his synapses were so large, it had no effect."
S03E02,JERRY,You know I hate to raise a crass financial concern but was there any information as to the where abouts of my PAPERS!
S03E02,GEORGE,She put them in her pocket book. She probably took them out there with her.
S03E02,JERRY,So what now?
S03E02,GEORGE,I don't know.
S03E02,JERRY,Can we go out there?
S03E02,GEORGE,Where?
S03E02,JERRY,Woodhaven.
S03E02,GEORGE,We could.
S03E02,GEORGE,I'm very nervous about this. I've never spoken to a mental patient before.
S03E02,JERRY,"My cousin Douglas was in a place like this one time . He came over to my house for dinner. There was no soda and he went bezerk. He was screamin' ""where's the Pepsi, where's the Pepsi?"""
S03E02,GEORGE,I should be in a place like this. I envy this woman. Ya' get to wear slippers all day. Friends visit. They pity you. Pity is very underrated. I like it it's good. Plus they give you those word association tests. I love those.
S03E02,JERRY,That'd be great. There's no wrong answer.

S03E02,ELAINE,KRAMER!
S03E02,KRAMER,Hey.
S03E02,ELAINE,WILL YOU PLEASE PUT SOMETHING ON.
S03E02,KRAMER,"Listen uh, you want some leftovers? I made some African food. There's, yambalas and uh, sambusa."
S03E02,TINA,"Kramer, are you coming back to bed?"
S03E02,KRAMER,"Yeah, yeah, I'll be right there baby."
S03E02,TINA,"Oh, hi Elaine. (returns Elaine's ear rings) What did you think of the coffee table?"
S03E02,ELAINE,It's invisible.
S03E02,KRAMER,"So, is everything cool? or what?"
S03E02,TINA,"Yeah, um, you seem little bit dysfunctional."
S03E02,ELAINE,"Well,"
S03E02,TINA,Come on Elaine. just tell us the truth.
S03E02,ELAINE,"The Truth!, You want The Truth?"
S03E02,PATRICE,Who are you?
S03E02,GEORGE,"Oh, this is my friend Jerry."
S03E02,PATRICE,Why are you talking like that? And what do YOU want?
S03E02,JERRY,"Want, want? What could I possibly want? Uh, I just came because I, I heard so many nice things about you from George."
S03E02,PATRICE,George thinks I'm pretentious.
S03E02,GEORGE,"Pretentious? Who, who isn't pretentious? Ha, ha, if everyone who was pretentious was in a mental institution, ... uh, obviously THIS isn't a mental institution."
S03E02,PATRICE,You're just trying to take it all back because you're feeling guilty I'm in here.
S03E02,GEORGE,"No, that's not it at all."
S03E02,PATRICE,Don't LIE George.
S03E02,GEORGE ,I'M NOT A LIER!
S03E02,GEORGE,"Uh, we're cool. Everything's cool (to security attendent)"
S03E02,JERRY,Just chatting. Friendly.
S03E02,GEORGE,"All righty, no reason for us to uh, raise our voices."
S03E02,PATRICE,I know what you said. You can't change that.
S03E02,GEORGE,What I said? I say stupid things all the time I can't go two minutes without saying stupid things.
S03E02,JERRY,"It's one stupid thing after another. So let me ask you, when you come to one of these places, what do you bring your pocketbook?"
S03E02,GEORGE,"You should be the one criticizing me. I, I'm lucky to even know someone like you."
S03E02,PATRICE,You mean that?
S03E02,GEORGE,Of course I mean that. I am incapable of guile.
S03E02,JERRY,"He's never guiled. You know some women keep a lot of important papers in their, uh, pocket books. Like for example oh, someone else's personal financial papers."
S03E02,PATRICE,"Papers? Oh, Jerry, You're the Jerome with the tax problem. You know after that day with George I got so cuckoo I threw out all your papers. So I'd love to help you but I'll need the copies."
S03E02,JERRY,there are no copies.
S03E02,PATRICE,So are you saying you want to continue seeing me?
S03E02,JERRY,Who makes copies?
S03E02,ELAINE,The truth is ... I think you make ... a very nice couple.
S03E02,KRAMER,"Oh,"
S03E02,TINA,"Kramer,"
S03E02,TINA,Here Kramer?
S03E02,KRAMER,"No, lets go to the couch..."
S03E02,JERRY,"(on phone)Yes, I'm trying to get a copy of a receipt for a computer that I bought there.... it was 1987 ... I remember I talked to a guy - he had like a maroon sport jacket - and he might have had a toupee - oh, it was a weave - ok uh, then I'll come bye ok, bye."
S03E02,JERRY,Anybody want to take a walk down to 48th street? I think I may have tracked down another receipt.
S03E02,ELAINE,I can't. I have to go visit Tina in the hospital.
S03E02,JERRY,George?
S03E02,GEORGE,"I'm going to a poetry reading with PATRICE First time poets, in a burnt out building, down by the docks, Supposed to be good."
S03E02,KRAMER,"Hey, Are you going to the hospital now?"
S03E02,ELAINE,"Yeah, I suppose I am."
S03E02,KRAMER,"All right, great, great uh, we'll share a cab."
S03E02,JERRY,You're going by 48th St. You can give me a ride.
S03E02,GEORGE,"Hey, I'm getting in on that."
S03E02,ELAINE,You know you're chippin' in.
S03E02,GEORGE,You're going that way anyway!
S03E02,JERRY,"I was audited last year. At first I thought well, IRS kinda sounds like Toys R Us maybe won't be so bad. Maybe they have a sense of fun about it, you know. But it's it's bad. It's an ordeal. And they don't do anything to keep your spirits up through the ordeal. I think they should take all your receipts and put them in one of those big Lucite sweepstake drums and just kinda crank it around there. You know give me a feeling like you might win something. You know what I mean? Then they can pull them out one by one and go ""Oh, I'm sorry that's another illegal deduction. But we do have some lovely parting gifts for you. Jail!"""

S03E03,JERRY,"I have never seen an old person in a new bathing suit in my life. I don't know where they get their bathing suits, but my father has bathing suits from other centuries. My parents live in Florida, and if you go down there and you forget your bathing suits then they want you to wear one of theirs. You know how that gets? ""You need trunks son? I've got trunks for you. You can wear my trunks."" Fathers don't wear bathing suits, they wear trunks. It's kind of the same thing a tree would wear if it went swimming. So I get in the water with in thing and it's like floating around me somewhere. Did you ever put on a bathing suit that you don't even know exactly where you are inside the bathing suit? You bump into somebody you know ""No I'm parasailing, I'm waiting for the boat to come back."""

S03E03,HELEN,Oh I think that's them!
S03E03,MORTY,You what I'll do next time? I'll hide it so nobody can find it.

S03E03,MORTY,"So, what took you so long?"
S03E03,JERRY,"Ahh, we waited 35 minutes in the rent-a-car place."
S03E03,HELEN,I don't know why you had to rent a car. We would have picked you up.
S03E03,JERRY,What's the difference?
S03E03,HELEN,You could have used our car.
S03E03,JERRY,I don't wanna use your car.
S03E03,HELEN,What's wrong with our car?
S03E03,JERRY,Nothing. It's a fine car. What if you wanna use it?
S03E03,HELEN,We don't use it.
S03E03,MORTY,What are you talking? We use it.
S03E03,HELEN,"If you were using it, we wouldn't use it."
S03E03,JERRY,So what would you do? You'd hitch?
S03E03,HELEN,How much is a rent-a-car?
S03E03,JERRY,I don't know. 25 bucks a day.
S03E03,HELEN,What? You're crazy.
S03E03,MORTY,Plus the insurance.
S03E03,JERRY,"Oh, I didn't get the insurance."
S03E03,MORTY,How could you not get the insurance?
S03E03,HELEN,We'll pay for the car.
S03E03,JERRY,You're not paying for it.
S03E03,HELEN,Morty. (asking him to back her. He doesn't)
S03E03,JERRY,God it's so hot in here. Why don't you put on the air conditioning?
S03E03,HELEN,"You don't need the air conditioner. So, you have your speech all ready?"
S03E03,JERRY,It's not a speech. Do I have to make a speech?
S03E03,HELEN,"Of course, they're giving a testimonial for your father. You could do your comic routines."
S03E03,JERRY,"(ironically) Oh yeah, that will go over real well with that crowd."
S03E03,ELAINE,"(looking by the window) Ooh, you have a lake?"
S03E03,JERRY,The lake isn't real.
S03E03,HELEN,The lake is real.
S03E03,MORTY,Are you kidding? They built the lake.
S03E03,HELEN,But it's real. It's water.
S03E03,HELEN,Where are you going with those?
S03E03,JERRY,I'm gonna put Elaine's stuff in here.
S03E03,HELEN,Don't sleep in there. You can you use the bedroom.
S03E03,ELAINE,I can't take your bedroom.
S03E03,HELEN,I'm up at 6 o'clock in the morning.
S03E03,ELAINE,I can't kick you out of your bed.
S03E03,HELEN,We don't even sleep.
S03E03,JERRY,Ma.
S03E03,HELEN,"But this is sofa bed, you'll be uncomfortable."
S03E03,JERRY,(to Morty) What about you?
S03E03,MORTY,Why should I be comfortable?
S03E03,JERRY,(to Helen) What about him?
S03E03,HELEN,"Don't worry, he's comfortable."
S03E03,MORTY,I'll sleep standing up. I'll be fine.
S03E03,HELEN,Will you stop?
S03E03,ELAINE,"Yeah, I'll just stay in here. (goes in the guest room)"
S03E03,HELEN,"Jerry, (asking Jerry to go in the kitchen so Elaine won't hear) Jerry. You don't have to stay on the couch on my account. The two of you could stay in there together."
S03E03,JERRY,"Na, that's not such a good idea."
S03E03,HELEN,Well I tought that...
S03E03,JERRY,Not now. She's right inside.
S03E03,HELEN,(quieter) What happened?
S03E03,JERRY,I don't know. We decided we don't really work as a couple.
S03E03,HELEN,What does that mean?
S03E03,JERRY,Well...
S03E03,MORTY,(comes to the kitchen and with a loud voice) Why are you whispering?
S03E03,JERRY,"Shh! Nothing, nothing."
S03E03,HELEN,Elaine...
S03E03,MORTY,(still loud) What about her?
S03E03,JERRY,"(tries to explain to Morty but Elaine then comes out of the guest room to get more luggage, so he fakes a conversation) ...but you know, look at the sun-dried tomatoes. Where were they five years ago? It just goes to show you. You never know what... huh (waiting for Elaine to go back in the guest room) you know... huh... What could happen to a vegetable. It could just take right off at any time. (Morty finally gets it. So Jerry goes on quieter) We've tried all kind of arrangements, but we can't seem to be friends when we sleep together."
S03E03,MORTY,(Morty goes on louder! Did he ever whisper in any episode? -) Why do you need more friends? You've got plenty of friends.
S03E03,HELEN,He's an idealist.
S03E03,MORTY,What the hell are you looking for?
S03E03,JERRY,I'm looking. That's the point. I like looking.
S03E03,HELEN,He likes looking.
S03E03,MORTY,So look.
S03E03,HELEN,But how long can you look?
S03E03,JERRY,I'm going for the record.
S03E03,HELEN,You know your father wouldn't say so but he's really glad you came.
S03E03,JERRY,"Oh, come on."

S03E03,ELAINE,Hi. Nice to meet you.
S03E03,JACK,"So Jerry, you came all the way down here for this?"
S03E03,ELAINE,And scuba diving.
S03E03,HELEN,Scuba diving? Who's going scuba diving?
S03E03,JERRY,We're going scuba diving. We'll be back in time.
S03E03,HELEN,What do you have to go scuba diving for?
S03E03,JERRY,For fun.
S03E03,HELEN,For fun?
S03E03,MORTY,Jack have some spong cake.
S03E03,JACK,"No. thanks, no."
S03E03,MORTY,Jack is emceeing tomorrow. He's in charge of the whole thing.
S03E03,JACK,"So Jerry, your mother told me you're gonna do one your little comedy skits tomorrow?"
S03E03,JERRY,I don't think so.
S03E03,JACK,No? Listen Morty you wanna settle up for last night? (Morty nods) All right. I owe you 19.45$ (he gets his checks book and a pen from his pocket).
S03E03,MORTY,What did you have? You had the minute steak?
S03E03,JACK,Yeah.
S03E03,MORTY,Did you have a coke or what?
S03E03,JACK,I did NOT have a coke.
S03E03,MORTY,Somebody had a coke.
S03E03,HELEN,Oh I had a coke.
S03E03,DORIS,And I had the scampi.
S03E03,JACK,So that's 17.10$ and the tax and the tip.
S03E03,MORTY,All right. Make it 20 bucks.
S03E03,JACK,"It's 19.45$, Morty. (he gives him the check)"
S03E03,MORTY,19.45$ ?
S03E03,JACK,"See? You know your father. He can't get a write to the penny, but that's why he was such a good president."
S03E03,JERRY,What kind of pen is that?
S03E03,JACK,This pen?
S03E03,JERRY,Yeah.
S03E03,JACK,This is an astronaut pen. It writes upside down. They use this in space.
S03E03,JERRY,Wow! That's the astronaut pen. I heard about that. Where did you get it?
S03E03,JACK,Oh it was a gift.
S03E03,JERRY,Cause sometimes I write in bed and I have to turn and lean on my elbow to make the pen work.
S03E03,JACK,Take the pen.
S03E03,JERRY,Oh no.
S03E03,JACK,Go ahead.
S03E03,JERRY,I couldn't
S03E03,JACK,"Come on, take the pen!"
S03E03,JERRY,I can't take it.
S03E03,JACK,Do me a personal favor!
S03E03,JERRY,"No, I'm not..."
S03E03,JACK,Take the pen!
S03E03,JERRY,I cannot take it!
S03E03,JACK,Take the pen!
S03E03,JERRY,Are you sure?
S03E03,JACK,Positive! Take the pen!
S03E03,JERRY,"O.K. Thank you very much. Thank you. Gee, boy!"
S03E03,HELEN,"Jack, what are you doing?"
S03E03,JACK,Stop it!
S03E03,DORIS,"Jack, we should go. (they go to the door) It was nice meeting you."
S03E03,ELAINE,"Mmm, nice to meet you."
S03E03,JERRY,Thanks again.
S03E03,JACK,Come on!
S03E03,DORIS,(to Morty) She's adorable. (they leave)
S03E03,HELEN,(as soon as the door's closed) What did you take his pen for?
S03E03,JERRY,What he gave it to me.
S03E03,HELEN,You didn't have to take it.
S03E03,MORTY,Oh my God! She's gotta make a big deal out of everything.
S03E03,JERRY,He offered it to me.
S03E03,HELEN,Because you made such a big fuss about it.
S03E03,JERRY,I liked it. Should I have said I didn't like it?
S03E03,HELEN,You shouldn't have said anything. What did you expect him to do? (the camera shows Elaine shaking her head at their dispute)
S03E03,JERRY,"He could have said ""Thank you, I like it too"" and put it back in his pocket."
S03E03,HELEN,He loves that pen.
S03E03,MORTY,Oh come on!
S03E03,HELEN,"He talks about it all the time. Every time he takes it out he goes on and on about how it writes upside down, how the astronauts use it."
S03E03,JERRY,"If he likes it so much, he never should have offered it."
S03E03,HELEN,He didn't think you'd accpet.
S03E03,JERRY,"Well, he was wrong."
S03E03,HELEN,I know his wife. She has some mouth on her. She'll tell everyone in the condo now that you made him give you the pen. They're talking about it right now. (again we see Elaine smiling at their argument)
S03E03,JERRY,So you want me to return it?
S03E03,HELEN,Yes.
S03E03,MORTY,He's not gonna return the pen. That's ridiculous.
S03E03,JERRY,Hey I don't even want the pen now!
S03E03,MORTY,"Jack can afford to give away a pen with all his money. Believe me. He gives me a check for 19.45. He didn't have a Coke. Ho, ho, ho!"
S03E03,ELAINE,"Here, let me see it. (She takes a pad to try the pen) Hey, it writes upside down."

S03E03,HELEN,Is that what she said?
S03E03,EVELYN,Who?
S03E03,HELEN,Blanche.
S03E03,EVELYN,What are you talking about?
S03E03,HELEN,Hello? Oh hello Gussy. What? Jerry wouldn't do that. Jack gave it to him. All he said was he liked it. I mean nobody put a gun to his head. (to Jerry) You're giving him back that pen. (She continues the discussion with Gussy but we don't hear it.)
S03E03,ELAINE,Somebody please-- THE AIR CONDITIONER!
S03E03,MORTY,(Morty gets up) Oh! I forgot all about it.
S03E03,JERRY,"All I said was ""I like the pen""."
S03E03,MORTY,How the hell do you work this thing?
S03E03,[setting,"still the condo, later]"
S03E03,HELEN,Maybe you shouldn't go tonight.
S03E03,ELAINE,"No no, I wanna go."
S03E03,HELEN,But your back hurts.
S03E03,MORTY,Maybe a couple of muscle relaxers would help.
S03E03,ELAINE,"Oh, oh, O.K. (Helen holds her sweater tight against herself) You can turn down the air conditioning if you want."
S03E03,HELEN,No. I'm fine.
S03E03,ELAINE,You're not too cold?
S03E03,HELEN,No.
S03E03,JERRY,Don't be alarmed.
S03E03,MORTY,Oh my God! What the hell happened to you?
S03E03,JERRY,I'm O.K. My capillaries burst.
S03E03,HELEN,Your capillaries? Do you know what you look like?
S03E03,JERRY,(to Elaine on the floor) How are you doing?
S03E03,ELAINE,Having a good time!
S03E03,JERRY,Is it my imagination or is it freezing in here?
S03E03,HELEN,What happened to your eyes?
S03E03,JERRY,Well I started to go under...
S03E03,HELEN,With the instructor?
S03E03,JERRY,"Yeah, and I got about ten feet down and I felt this tremendous pressure on my mask. Like my eyeballs were being sucked out of their sockets."
S03E03,HELEN,I told you...
S03E03,JACK,Excuse me. (to Helen) Doris would like to borrow red your pocketbook to go with her shoes. (to Elaine on the floor) The shoes have to match the pocketbook. (to the others) What's she doing? Yoga?
S03E03,ELAINE,My back hurts.
S03E03,JACK,Morty you gotta hurry up. Get ready.
S03E03,MORTY,We got plenty of time.
S03E03,JACK,(to Jerry) What happened to you?
S03E03,JERRY,I got in a fist fight with one of the ladies at the pool.
S03E03,HELEN,It's from scuba diving.
S03E03,JACK,What's there to see underwater?
S03E03,(Helen turns to Jerry and makes a face like,give him back the pen)
S03E03,JERRY,"Listen M. Klompus, it was really a nice gesture of you to give me the pen, but I don't really need it."
S03E03,JACK,You what?
S03E03,JERRY,"I mean it's a terrific pen, but I think you should keep it. (he hands the pen to Jack)"
S03E03,JACK,Well I mean...
S03E03,JERRY,Take it.
S03E03,JACK,All right! (he smiles and take it)
S03E03,MORTY,"You know Jack, you've got a hell of a nerve taking that kid's pen."
S03E03,JACK,Whose pen?
S03E03,MORTY,His pen.
S03E03,JACK,This happens to be my pen.
S03E03,MORTY,You didn't give it to him.
S03E03,JACK,What are you talking about? He pratically begged me for it.
S03E03,MORTY,Where do you come off with this crap?
S03E03,JACK,"Listen, do you think I take everything everybody offers me? You offered me sponge cake yesterday. Did I take it?"
S03E03,MORTY,You said you didn't want it!
S03E03,JACK,Of course I wanted it! I love sponge cake!
S03E03,MORTY,Then who the hell said you couldn't have any? I mean what the hell do I care whether you have sponge cake?
S03E03,JACK,Because I saw the look on your face last week when I took the scotch tape!
S03E03,MORTY,Ahh! Ahh! So YOU got the scotch tape! I've been looking all over for it!
S03E03,JACK,Don't worry about it! I'll give it back!
S03E03,MORTY,I don't want it!
S03E03,JACK,I don't want it!
S03E03,MORTY,"You know Jack, do me a favor will you? Take the pen and the scotch tape, and get the hell out of here!"
S03E03,JACK,Listen do you think I give a damn?
S03E03,MORTY,Aah! (Jack leaves) The nerve of that guy! Taking back that pen. Well that's it for them.
S03E03,JERRY,What is going on in this community! Are you people aware of what's happening? What is driving you to this behavior? Is it the humudity? Is it the Muzak? Is it the white shoes?
S03E03,HELEN,I have no use for either one of them. I don't even want them there tonight. (she still has the pocketbook in her hands)
S03E03,JERRY,Isn't he supposed to be the emcee?
S03E03,MORTY,"yeah, he's supposed to be the emcee."
S03E03,JERRY,Well. This should be a very interesting evening.
S03E03,ELAINE,(still on the floor) Uh... What about those muscle relaxers?
S03E03,[setting,"reception room, evening]"
S03E03,PHOTOGRAPHER,Say astronaut.
S03E03,ELAINE,Say what? (laughing) Say what?
S03E03,JERRY,(Jerry brings her back) You took too many of those pills.
S03E03,MORTY,Astronaut?
S03E03,HELEN,Say it.
S03E03,"JERRY, MORTY AND HELEN",Astronaut!
S03E03,ELAINE,"(still laughing, she says it just as the picture is taking) Astro...naut!"
S03E03,MORTY,Good. O.K. (the photographer walks away) What about last year when I took him to the hospital every day? Did he ever say thank you?
S03E03,JERRY,Oh God. (foreseeing an arm's grabbing as he sees Uncle Leo entering with his wife Stella)
S03E03,JERRY,(to Leo) Uncle Leo.
S03E03,LEO,Hello!
S03E03,STELLA,Morty are you nervous?
S03E03,MORTY,What nervous?
S03E03,LEO,(to Jerry while he's grabbing his arm as usual) What's with the sunglasses? Who are you? Van Johnson?
S03E03,JERRY,I've got a black eye.
S03E03,STELLA,(to Elaine in a childish voice) Hello.
S03E03,JERRY,"Oh uh, Elaine, this is my aunt Stella."
S03E03,HELEN,(shouting as she imitates Marlon Brando) STELLA! STELLA!
S03E03,JERRY,(to Stella) Her back hurts.
S03E03,STELLA,"Humm... We saw you on ""The Tonight Show"" last week."
S03E03,LEO,I thought Johnny was very rude to you. He didn't even let you talk.
S03E03,JERRY,"No, no."
S03E03,LEO,You need some new material. I've heard you do that dog routine three times already.
S03E03,ELAINE,"(still with her imitation, shouting even louder) STELLA! STELLA!"
S03E03,LEO,"Listen, you should get your cousin Jeffrey to write some material for you."
S03E03,MORTY,What are you talking? Jeffrey works for the parks department!
S03E03,LEO,"You should read the letters he's written. He's funnier than the whole bunch of you! (Jack enters with Doris) Oh, here's Jack. We should sit down."
S03E03,STELLA,"(to Helen on a sarcastic tone of voice) This better be good. I'm missing ""Golden Girls"" for this."
S03E03,HELEN,(laughing hypocritically till Stella walks away) I hate her like poison.
S03E03,"(a few minutes later, the ceremony is about to begin. Someone in the crowd yells","""Hey Jack let's get started!"" Everyone applause and we see, from left to right, all sitting on the same side of a long table, facing the public Stella, Leo, Elaine, Jerry, Helen, Morty, Jack at the microphone, Doris, and four other people.)"
S03E03,JACK,"(on the microphone) Ladies and gentlemen, as you know, every year, Phase Two of the Pines of Mark Gables honors the previous year president. And this year we are honoring Morty Seinfeld (the crowd applause and someone yells Morty!) A man who slept more hours on the job than Ronald Reagan."
S03E03,MORTY,(to Helen) Slept on the job? (she shushed him)
S03E03,JACK,"Being president of the condo is not easy. It requires hard work, dedication, and commitment, and unfortunately he possesses none of these qualities. (everyone laugh except Jerry, Helen, and Morty. Even Elaine who's still druggy)"
S03E03,HELEN,(Morty complains again to Helen) He's joking.
S03E03,JACK,His administration did excel in one department the hiring of incompetents.
S03E03,MORTY,"(to Jack, loud) That's what you say."
S03E03,JACK,"But we do owe him a debt of gratitude because by not fixing the crack in the sidewalk, he put Mrs Ziven out of commission for a few weeks. (Morty is now the only one not laughing)"
S03E03,MORTY,(loud) Tell them when you took my son's pen back. Tell them about that! (he gets up)
S03E03,JERRY,Dad!
S03E03,MORTY,"(to the crowd) He gave my son a pen, and then he takes it back. Tell them about that!"
S03E03,JACK,He gave it to me!
S03E03,MORTY,"Come on. That's enough, sit down!"
S03E03,JACK,I'm not sitting down!
S03E03,JACK,Ow! You broke my dental plate! (Jack is touching his dental plate while Morty reaches in Jack's pocket to get the pen) Doris! He broke my dental plate. You son-of-a-bitch! I'm gonna sue you. (he leaves the table and Morty follows him and continue arguing with him. Jerry now have the microphone in his hands and the crowd begins to think the ceremony is over.)
S03E03,HELEN,"Jerry, do your act."
S03E03,JERRY,"(in the microphone, but to Helen) I can't. Nobody's even listening."
S03E03,HELEN,They're all gonna leave.
S03E03,JERRY,(to himself) Oh God! (in the microphone) huh... Hey! How you folks doing tonight? (everybody in the crowd is talking over Jerry)
S03E03,MAN IN THE CROWD,Who are you?
S03E03,JERRY,(still with his sunglasses) Have you ever noticed how they always give you the peanuts on the planes?
S03E03,WOMAN IN THE CROWD,(to heckle Jerry) Not my Harry. He flies first class.
S03E03,JERRY,Who ever thought the first thing somebody wants on a plane is a peanut?
S03E03,MAN IN THE CROWD,I'd rather have a bottle of scotch!
S03E03,HELEN,(to Jerry) Do the dog routine.
S03E03,JERRY,All I said was I liked the pen!
S03E03,ELAINE,(wakes up and yells very loud) STELLA!
S03E03,[setting,"condo, morning]"
S03E03,CHIROPRACTOR,You could aggravate it. I wouldn't go anywhere for at least five days.
S03E03,ELAINE,Five days? You want me to stay here for five more days?
S03E03,JERRY,There must be some mistake.
S03E03,CHIROPRACTOR,I'm afraid not.
S03E03,ELAINE,(discouraged) Five days. Here.
S03E03,HELEN,"(to Jerry, happily) So we have you for five more days!"
S03E03,JERRY,(to Elaine) Well there's really no point in me staying. I mean you just gonna be...
S03E03,ELAINE,Excuse me?
S03E03,JERRY,Nothing.
S03E03,EVELYN,Good morning.
S03E03,JERRY,Hi Evelyn.
S03E03,EVELYN,(to Helen) Has Morty decided on a lawyer yet?
S03E03,HELEN,I don't think so.
S03E03,EVELYN,Because my nephew Larry could do it. He's a brilliant lawyer. He says Jack has no case.
S03E03,HELEN,Well I'll ask him when he gets up.
S03E03,EVELYN,"Oh, and I spoke to Arnold. And he says that according to the bylaws of the condo constitution, they need six votes to throw you out for unruly behavior. Not five. Doctor Chernov is the one you'll have to suck up to."
S03E03,MORTY,Aw! Aw! Oh my back! Oh my back! It's that bar. Who the hell could sleep on that thing?
S03E03,HELEN,I was very comfortable.
S03E03,EVELYN,"Morty, Arnold says they need six votes to throw you out."
S03E03,HELEN,It's in the constitution.
S03E03,MORTY,(to the chiro) Who are you?
S03E03,CHIROPRACTOR,I'm a chiropractor.
S03E03,MORTY,What are you kidding me?
S03E03,ELAINE,(to Jerry) Five more days?
S03E03,JERRY,Well today's almost over. And weekdays always go by fast. Friday we're leaving. It's like two days really. It's like a cup of coffee. It will go by like that. (snapping his fingers)
S03E03,[setting,"night club, closing monologue]"
S03E03,JERRY,"Is Florida not hot and muggy enough for these people? They love heat. I mean if they ever decide to land men on the sun, I think these old retired guys would be the only ones that will be able to handle it. They'll just sit there on the sun, on the redwood benches, washcloth on the head going ""Close the door, you're letting all the heat off the sun. I'm trying to get a sweat going."""
S03E04,JERRY,"So I'm on the plane, we left late. Pilot says we're going to be making up some time in the air. I thought, well isn't that interesting. We'll just make up time. That's why you have to reset your watch when you land. Of course, when they say they're making up time, obviously they're increasing the speed of the aircraft. Now, my question is if you can go faster, why don't you just go as fast as you can all the time? C'mon, there's no cops up here, nail it. Give it some gas! We're flying!"
S03E04,GAVIN,"Travelling, of course, is the best education. Do you know last year I was in over forty, forty-five countries, and I would have gone to more but I had just got a puppy, and he was too young to take with me. But now I won't travel without him."
S03E04,JERRY,Is he on the plane now?
S03E04,GAVIN,"Oh yes. Yes, he's in the, he's in the baggage compartment. I don't know why they won't let him sit up here with me. He's a lot better behaved than most of the dregs you find onboard here. Do you, do you have any pets?"
S03E04,JERRY,"Uh, just my next door neighbor."
S03E04,GAVIN,You're missing out on a relationship that could enrich your life in ways that you never could have thought possible.
S03E04,JERRY,"Howbout picking up their, you know. You find that enriching?"
S03E04,JERRY,What's the matter?
S03E04,GAVIN,"Oh, I'm feeling a bit queasy."
S03E04,ATTENDANT #1,"Sir, we're gonna make an emergency landing in Chicago and get you to a hospital."
S03E04,GAVIN,My dog. What about my dog?
S03E04,ATTENDANT #1,"Uh, you have a dog?"
S03E04,ATTENDANT #2,"Do you know anyone on the plane, Mr. Palone?"
S03E04,GAVIN,Jerry?
S03E04,JERRY,Huh? How you feeling?
S03E04,GAVIN,Would you take care of Farfel?
S03E04,JERRY,Farfel?
S03E04,ATTENDANT #2,"It's his dog. We're landing in Chicago to get him to a hospital, could you take his dog to New York?"
S03E04,JERRY,The dog? The dog??
S03E04,GAVIN,I'm sure it's only for a day or two.
S03E04,JERRY,"But, you know, what if, you know?"
S03E04,GAVIN,"Give me your address and phone number, I'll call you."
S03E04,JERRY,The dog?
S03E04,JERRY,"Let go, Farfel! Let go, gimme that! Gimme the sneaker you stupid idiot! Shut up! (to Elaine) So what would you do?"
S03E04,ELAINE,"Well it's only been three days, I'm sure he's gonna call."
S03E04,JERRY (to Farfel),"STOP IT! SHUT UUUUUUP!!! (to Elaine) Do you believe this? Do you believe what I'm dealing with here, I've got a wild animal in the house! He's deranged, maybe he's got rabies. I can get lockjaw."
S03E04,ELAINE,If only.
S03E04,JERRY,"Look at this place. He's going everywhere, I can't go out of the house at night. I haven't performed in three days. This'll be my first night out of the house since I got back."
S03E04,ELAINE,"Hey, when you walk him, do ya..."
S03E04,JERRY,Do I what?
S03E04,ELAINE,Do you pick it up?
S03E04,JERRY,"Yes, I pick it up."
S03E04,ELAINE,You pick it up?!?
S03E04,JERRY,Well you have to.
S03E04,ELAINE,"Oh, boy would I love to see that."
S03E04,JERRY,"SHUT UP!! Shut up Farfel, stop it! (to Elaine) I don't know what to do. I mean what if I take it to the pound then the guy shows up?"
S03E04,ELAINE,"Maybe you should call the airline, they might know where he is."
S03E04,JERRY,"No, I tried. they don't know anything. (notices Elaine making egg creams) You gotta put the syrup in first."
S03E04,ELAINE,"No, milk."
S03E04,JERRY,"I'm telling you the guy's a drunk, he's probably on a bender."
S03E04,ELAINE,What is a bender anyhow?
S03E04,JERRY,"I don't know, they drink and they bend things at the bar."
S03E04,ELAINE,I can't believe he hasn't called.
S03E04,JERRY,"Two hundred seats on a plane, I gotta wind up next to Yukon Jack and his dog Cujo. Shut up! One more day and you are pound bound!"
S03E04,KRAMER,"Sorry, I can't watch the dog tonight."
S03E04,JERRY,Why?
S03E04,ELAINE,"We're going to the movies, we're gonna see Prognosis Negative."
S03E04,KRAMER,"I can't, I gotta get this Ellen out of my life."
S03E04,JERRY,You're breaking up?
S03E04,KRAMER,"Oh ho ho ho yeah, the sooner the better. I can't wait to do it. You know how there's some people you worry about whether you're going to hurt their feelings? With her, I'm looking forward to it. I'd like to get it on video, watch it in slow motion and freeze frame it. Oh ho, yeah."
S03E04,ELAINE,"Kramer, I don't know how you lasted as long as you did."
S03E04,KRAMER,"Woah, you didn't like her?"
S03E04,ELAINE,"If you could see her personality it would be like one of the Elephant Man exhibits, you know where they pull off the sheet and everyone gasps."
S03E04,JERRY,I can't believe someone hasn't killed her yet.
S03E04,KRAMER,How come you never said anything?
S03E04,JERRY,Well you can't tell someone how you feel about their girlfriend until after they stop seeing them.
S03E04,KRAMER,I tell you.
S03E04,JERRY,You. I'm talking about people.
S03E04,ELAINE,Are we still going to the movies tonight?
S03E04,JERRY,"No, I can't I gotta watch Farfel, you and George can go without me."
S03E04,ELAINE,Just me and George?
S03E04,JERRY,Sure.
S03E04,ELAINE,But we need you.
S03E04,JERRY,What do you need me for?
S03E04,ELAINE,Because... Yeah?
S03E04,GEORGE,Prognosis Negative! (in a funny voice)
S03E04,ELAINE,"Because I relate to George through you, we're like friends-in-law. Besides, you said we were gonna see Prognosis Negative together. Can't you just put some newspapers down or something?"
S03E04,JERRY,"No, I can't trust him, he gets insane. I won't enjoy myself. That's right, Farfel, I'm talking about you!"
S03E04,ELAINE,Just me and George alone?
S03E04,GEORGE,"Let's go, people, let's go! It's Prognosis Negative time, wa ha ha ha!!!"
S03E04,JERRY,I can't go.
S03E04,GEORGE,"Can't go, Why not?"
S03E04,JERRY,Because I have to watch idiot Farfel.
S03E04,GEORGE,I thought Kramer was watching.
S03E04,JERRY,He's breaking up with his girlfriend tonight.
S03E04,GEORGE,"Well so what's the problem, you just put some newspaper down."
S03E04,JERRY,"No, I don't want that smell in the house."
S03E04,GEORGE,You spritz a little Lysol on it.
S03E04,JERRY,"No, it's like BO and cologne, they combine forces into some kind of strange mutant funk."
S03E04,GEORGE,So we're not going?
S03E04,JERRY,Nah. You two go.
S03E04,GEORGE,Oh. You still wanna go?
S03E04,ELAINE,"Do, do you?"
S03E04,GEORGE,If you want.
S03E04,ELAINE,"It,s, it's up to you."
S03E04,JERRY,Go ahead.
S03E04,ELAINE,"Well, it's, I really wanted to see Prognosis Negative with Jerry, uh, you wanna see Ponce de Leon?"
S03E04,GEORGE,Ponce de Leon? Okay. (to Jerry) You sure you don't wanna go?
S03E04,JERRY,I want to but I can't.
S03E04,ELAINE,Oh! I tell you what. How about if I come back here first and I clean everything up and I open up the windows and if you're still not satisfied we can switch apartments for the night.
S03E04,JERRY,No.
S03E04,GEORGE,What about this--
S03E04,JERRY,"Forget it. Go ahead, you'll have a good time."
S03E04,ELAINE,"I know, it's not that."
S03E04,GEORGE,It's just we want you to go.
S03E04,JERRY,"Well, thank you very much. I'm telling you, one more day stinkbreath!"
S03E04,JERRY,"On my block, a lot of ah, people walk their dogs, and I always see them walking along with their little poop bags, which to me is just the lowest function of human life. If aliens are watching this through telescopes, they're gonna think the dogs are the leaders. If you see two life forms, one of them's making a poop, the other one's carrying it for him, who would you assume was in charge?"
S03E04,GEORGE,So how long did you live there?
S03E04,ELAINE,About three years.
S03E04,GEORGE,That's pretty long.
S03E04,ELAINE,Hmm.
S03E04,GEORGE,"It's not that long, really."
S03E04,ELAINE,Yeah.
S03E04,GEORGE,And then you came here.
S03E04,ELAINE,Yeah. So I've been here about six years.
S03E04,GEORGE (Counting on his fingers),"Eighty-six, eighty-seven, eighty-eight, eighty-nine, ninety, ninety-one... Yup."
S03E04,JERRY,"Bad dog! Bad dog! You go outside! Outside!! What do you want from me? Tell me! Money, you want money? I'll give you money, how much?!"
S03E04,KRAMER,"I must have been out of my mind. Look at you. Why don't you do something with your life? Sit around here all day, you contribute nothing to society. You're just taking up space. How could I be with someone like you? Wouldn't respect myself."
S03E04,GEORGE,I like herbal tea.
S03E04,GEORGE,Chamomile's good. Lemon Lift. Almond Pleasure.
S03E04,ELAINE,Jerry likes Morning Thunder.
S03E04,GEORGE,Jerry drinks Morning Thunder?
S03E04,ELAINE,Yeah.
S03E04,GEORGE,"Morning Thunder has caffeine in it, Jerry doesn't drink caffeine."
S03E04,ELAINE,Jerry doesn't know Morning Thunder has caffeine in it.
S03E04,GEORGE,You don't tell him?
S03E04,ELAINE (laughing),"No. And you should see him, man, he gets all hyper, he doesn't even know why, he loves it! He walks around, going, ""God, I feel great!"""
S03E04,GEORGE (laughing),You don't tell him?
S03E04,ELAINE,No.
S03E04,GEORGE,That is so funny!
S03E04,ELAINE,I know!
S03E04,GEORGE,"Wait, have you ever seen him throw up?!"
S03E04,KRAMER,"Please! Please!! I take it all back, everything! I take it all back, every word! I love you! I love *you*! I can't live without you, I,ll, I'll do anything!"
S03E04,JERRY,"That's right, Gavin Palone. What? Are you sure? He was released on Monday? *Last* Monday? Did he leave a phone number or address? Unbelievable. Well thank you, thanks, thanks very much. (Hangs up) That's it, Farfel! Party's over! Start packing up your little squeeze toys buddy boy, you're checking out!"
S03E04,ELAINE,It was weird because George and I get along so great in so many situations but this is the first time we ever really went one-on-one.
S03E04,JERRY,"Oh, one-on-one's a whole different game. Can't pass off."
S03E04,ELAINE,The only time it wasn't uncomfortable was when we were making fun of you.
S03E04,JERRY,"Going to the dog pound, everybody! Going to the dog pound, come on down. (To Elaine) What?"
S03E04,ELAINE,Do you have to?
S03E04,JERRY,What am I supposed to do? I don't want to do it. I like dogs. I'm not sure this is a dog.
S03E04,ELAINE,"You know, the guy might have just lost your number."
S03E04,JERRY,I'm in the book and I have a machine.
S03E04,ELAINE,"Jerry, do you know what they do to dogs at the pound? They keep them there for a week and then if nobody claims them, they kill them."
S03E04,JERRY,Really? How late are they open?
S03E04,JERRY,What?
S03E04,ELAINE,What is it?
S03E04,KRAMER,I went back with Ellen.
S03E04,JERRY and ELAINE,"Ohhhhh, that's great."
S03E04,ELAINE,Terrific.
S03E04,JERRY,"Yeah, I really think you guys are good together."
S03E04,ELAINE,"Yes, she understands you and she is not demanding."
S03E04,KRAMER,Do you think that I forgot what you two said about her?
S03E04,JERRY,"Well I was just trying to be supportive, you know. I knew you were upset."
S03E04,KRAMER,"From now on when we pass each other in the hall, I don't know you, you don't know me."
S03E04,ELAINE,"Oh, Kramer, we didn't mean it."
S03E04,JERRY,What are you doing?
S03E04,KRAMER,I'm getting my pot.
S03E04,ELAINE,"Kramer, we like her."
S03E04,JERRY,Kramer? What did we say that's so bad?
S03E04,ELAINE,I believe I referred to her personality as a potential science exhibit.
S03E04,JERRY,"I said, ""How come no one's killed her?"" Probably shouldn't have said anything,"
S03E04,JERRY,Well.
S03E04,ELAINE,Well.
S03E04,JERRY,everyone knows the first break-up never takes. (answers buzzer) Yeah?
S03E04,GEORGE,Prognosis Negative! (again in a funny voice)
S03E04,JERRY,"Okay, Farfel, put your shoes on."
S03E04,ELAINE,"Jerry, can't you just give it one more day, it's not his fault."
S03E04,JERRY,"It's not my dog, I don't know where this boozehound is."
S03E04,ELAINE,"Alright, I tell you what. How about if you and George go to the movies, and I stay here and watch the dog tonight."
S03E04,JERRY,"I can't let you do that, what about Prognosis Negative?"
S03E04,ELAINE,We'll see it Sunday.
S03E04,GEORGE,"Tonight's the night, right? Prognosis Negative?"
S03E04,ELAINE,"I'm not going, I'm gonna watch the dog."
S03E04,GEORGE,What does this mean?
S03E04,JERRY,"Well, we'll go see something else tonight. We'll see, uh, Ponce De Leon."
S03E04,GEORGE,"What is with this dog, I thought we were taking it to the pound."
S03E04,JERRY,"She talked me into one more day. Talk amongst yourselves, I'm gonna go to the bathroom."
S03E04,GEORGE,"Uh Jerry, how long will you be in there?"
S03E04,JERRY,"I don't know, regular human time?"
S03E04,GEORGE,Uh why don't you wait then go in the movies?
S03E04,JERRY,Why shouldn't I go here?
S03E04,ELAINE,"Well, you know, I mean, sometimes it's good to get there and make sure you get your seats and then go to the bathroom."
S03E04,GEORGE,And isn't it more fun using the urinal?
S03E04,ELAINE,Yeah.
S03E04,JERRY,"Oh yeah, urinals are fun. Can I go?!"
S03E04,GEORGE,"Hey, go."
S03E04,ELAINE,Who's stopping you?
S03E04,GEORGE,"What, are you doing me a favor?"
S03E04,ELAINE,Like we care if you go to the bathroom.
S03E04,GEORGE,How's it going?
S03E04,ELAINE,Good. Good. You?
S03E04,GEORGE,Things are good.
S03E04,ELAINE,"Boy, he takes such a long time."
S03E04,GEORGE,I know.
S03E04,ELAINE,You know what he does in there? He gargles.
S03E04,GEORGE,Jerry gargles? Is that why he takes so long?
S03E04,ELAINE,"Yeah, he does it like six times a day."
S03E04,GEORGE,How come we never hear him?
S03E04,ELAINE,"Because he does it quiet. He does it quiet. Lookit, Just like this, watch."
S03E04,GEORGE,"Wait, wait, did you ever see him throw up?!"
S03E04,ELAINE,We talked about that already.
S03E04,GEORGE,Oh.
S03E04,GEORGE,I have nothing to say to anybody. I'm so uninteresting. I think I'm out of conversation.
S03E04,JERRY,So what are calling me six times a day?
S03E04,GEORGE,"All I know about is sports. That's it. No matter how depressed I get, I could always read the sports section."
S03E04,JERRY,I could read the sports section if my hair was on fire.
S03E04,GEORGE,Know what? Ponce De Leon is sold out.
S03E04,JERRY,"It is? Oh yeah, you're right. What else is playing?"
S03E04,GEORGE,Nothing except Prognosis Negative.
S03E04,JERRY,"Boy, I know she really wants to see that with me."
S03E04,ELAINE,"Gimme the jacket, furface, this is not Seinfeld you're dealing with! When I get through with you, you'll be begging to go to the pound!"
S03E04,ELAINE,"Shut up. Shut up! (Answers phone) Hello? No, who's calling? Oh my god, the dog guy. Where have *you* been? Yeah, well you better pick up your dog tonight or he has humped his last leg."
S03E04,GEORGE,"I mean, I could understand if there was something else playing, but it's this or nothing."
S03E04,JERRY,I don't know what to do.
S03E04,GEORGE,"What is this 'saving movies' thing? Something's playing, you go."
S03E04,JERRY,"I know, I know."
S03E04,GEORGE,"So, what? We're gonna do nothing now, this is crazy."
S03E04,JERRY,It is kind of silly.
S03E04,GEORGE,Of course it is.
S03E04,JERRY,"I mean, it's just a movie, for god's sake."
S03E04,GEORGE,Exactly.
S03E04,JERRY,It's not like she's *in* the movie.
S03E04,GEORGE,Right.
S03E04,JERRY,"Am I supposed to ruin the whole night because she wants to see it? I mean, if I could have seen it with her, fine. But I can't control all these circumstances and schedules and peoples' availabilities at movies."
S03E04,GEORGE,"And she'll still see it, you're not stopping her from seeing it."
S03E04,JERRY,"How does sitting next to a person in a movie theater increase the level of enjoyment? You can't talk during a movie. You know, this is stupid, c'mon, let's just go."
S03E04,GEORGE,Good.
S03E04,JERRY,Saving movies.
S03E04,GEORGE,Ridiculous!
S03E04,JERRY,Two for Prognosis Negative. I'm in big trouble.
S03E04,GEORGE,"Oh, you're dead."
S03E04,GAVIN,"Bell's Palsy. The entire side of my, of, of my face was paralyzed. Farfel! I couldn't, I couldn't, I couldn't even feed myself, I was completely incapacitated. Quiet Farfel!"
S03E04,JERRY,"You know it's interesting, because I called the hospital and they said you were released on Monday."
S03E04,GAVIN,"Yes, yes, that's true, but then I was taken to the Bell's Palsy Center in, in, in, in Rockford. Absolutely first, first rate facility, top notch physicians."
S03E04,KRAMER,"Hey, c'mon, c'mon, get off me!"
S03E04,GAVIN,"He won't hurt you, he's just playing."
S03E04,KRAMER,Hey you keep that mutt away from me.
S03E04,GAVIN,Mutt? I'll wager his parents are more pure than yours.
S03E04,ELLEN,"Kramer, are you coming?"
S03E04,JERRY,"Oh, hi Ellen."
S03E04,ELLEN,Get in here.
S03E04,JERRY,"Listen, it's really been a pleasure taking care of your dog for a week, but if you don't mind..."
S03E04,GAVIN,Pre-prediction. You'll be calling me to ask if you can come and visit him before the month is out.
S03E04,JERRY,Prediction. I never see you or him again for the rest of my life.
S03E04,ELAINE,We made plans.
S03E04,JERRY,Why don't we just rent a movie?
S03E04,ELAINE,I thought you wanted to see Prognosis Negative.
S03E04,JERRY,"No, it&Mac226;s, it's supposed to be really bad, *really* bad. I mean it's long, there's no story, it's so unbelievably boring, I heard. i..."
S03E04,ELAINE,"Jerry, you promised me we'd go."
S03E04,JERRY,"Well, George told me the whole story, line for line, I mean I almost feel like I've seen it already and walked out on it."
S03E04,ELAINE,"Wait, George saw the movie? I saw him yesterday, he didn't mention it."
S03E04,JERRY,You and George got together?
S03E04,ELAINE,"Yeah, I wanted to talk about how we have nothing to talk about."
S03E04,JERRY,Hello.
S03E04,KRAMER,"Hi, hi, hi, hi, hi."
S03E04,JERRY,What's up?
S03E04,KRAMER,"Well, ah you were right."
S03E04,JERRY,About what?
S03E04,KRAMER,"Ellen. We, uh, broke up again."
S03E04,"JERRY and ELAINE, together",Awwwwww.
S03E04,JERRY,Too bad.
S03E04,ELAINE,I thought she was the one.
S03E04,KRAMER,I'll bring back the pot.
S03E04,ELAINE,"Okay, c'mon it's movie time."
S03E04,KRAMER,"Hey, what are you gonna see?"
S03E04,JERRY,Prognosis Negative.
S03E04,KRAMER,"Hey, that's supposed to be great."
S03E04,JERRY,It's not.
S03E04,KRAMER,How do you know?
S03E04,JERRY,I have an instinct for these things.
S03E04,JERRY,"I had a parakeet when I was a kid, that was the only pet that I really enjoyed. We used to let him out of his cage, and he would fly around and my mother had built, one entire wall of our living room was mirrored. She felt this gives you a feeling of space. Have you ever heard this interior design principle that a mirror makes it seem like you have an entire other room? What kind of a jerk walks up to a mirror and goes, ""Hey look, there's a whole nother room in there. There's a guy in there looks just like me."" But the parakeet will fall for this, you'll let him out of his cage, he flies around the room, BANG! With his little head, he would just go 'click' Ohh! And I'd always think, even if he thinks the mirror is another room, why doesn't he at least try to avoid hitting the other parakeet?"
S03E05,JERRY,"Does it seem to you that the ventriloquist dummy has a very active sexual social life? he's always talking about dates and women that he knows and bringing them back to the suitcase at night, there's always a sawdust joke in there somewhere you know, kinky things cuz he's made out of wood an' he can spin his head around, we're somehow expected to believe because the face is soo animated that they think we aren't noticing that the feet are just swinging there, dummy feet never look right do they? they're just kinda dangling there, always kinda askew you know? you always see just little ankle, those thin fabric ankles that they have you know. Ya think 'I don't think this thing is real.'"
S03E05,JERRY,Let me speak with the head librarian. ... Because it's absurd. An overdue book from 1971? ... This is a joke right? What are you? From a radio station?
S03E05,KRAMER,enters
S03E05,JERRY,"Ya' got me I fell for it. Alright, OK I can be down there in like a half hour. Bye."
S03E05,KRAMER,What's the problem?
S03E05,JERRY,This you're not goin' to believe. The NYPL says that I took out Tropic of Cancer in 1971 and never returned it.
S03E05,KRAMER,"Do you know how much that comes to? That's a nickel a day for 20 years. It's going to be $50,000"
S03E05,JERRY,It doesn't work like that.
S03E05,KRAMER,"If it's a dime a day it could be $100,000"
S03E05,JERRY,It's not going to be anything. I returned the book. I remember it very vividly because I was with Sherry Becker. She wore this orange dress. It was the first time I ever saw her in a dress like that. In oticed since ninth grade she was developing this body in secret under these loose clothes for like two years. And then one day ...
S03E05,JERRY,That orange dress is burned in my memory
S03E05,KRAMER,"Oh, memory burn."
S03E05,JERRY,I wonder what ever happened to her.
S03E05,KRAMER,How did they ever find you?
S03E05,JERRY,"Oh, computers, they're cracking down now on overdue books. The whole thing is completely ridiculous."
S03E05,JERRY,It's George. Wait 'til he hears we're going to the library
S03E05,KRAMER,You know I never got a library card.
S03E05,JERRY,(to speaker) Coming down.
S03E05,KRAMER,"It's all a bunch of cheapskates in there anyway. People sitting around reading the newspaper attached to huge wooden sticks Trying to save a quarter, ooh,"
S03E05,JERRY,I gotta go to the library. You want to go?
S03E05,KRAMER,"Yeah,"
S03E05,KRAMER,"The Dewey Decimal System, what a scam that was. Boy that Dewey guy really cleaned up on that deal."
S03E05,JERRY,Where's George
S03E05,READER,Shhh.
S03E05,KRAMER,Tryin' to save a quarter.
S03E05,JERRY,I kinda like those sticks. I'd like to get them in my house.
S03E05,JERRY,This woman's completely ignoring me.
S03E05,KRAMER,Look at her. This is a lonely woman looking for companionship.. ... Spinster. ... Maybe a virgin. ... Maybe she got hurt a long time ago. She was a schoolgirl. There was a boy It didn't work out. Now she needs a little tenderness. She needs a little understanding. She needs a little Kramer.
S03E05,JERRY,Eventually a little shot of penicillin
S03E05,LIBRARIAN,Yes?
S03E05,JERRY,Yeah I called before. I got his notice in the mail.
S03E05,LIBRARIAN,"Oh, Tropic of Cancer, Henry Miller, Uh, this case has been turned over to our library investigation officer Mr. Bookman."
S03E05,KRAMER,"Bookman? The library investigator's name is actually, Bookman?"
S03E05,LIBRARIAN,It's true.
S03E05,KRAMER,"That's amazing. That's like an ice cream man named, Cone."
S03E05,LIBRARIAN,Lt. Bookman has been working here for 25 years so I think he's heard all the jokes.
S03E05,JERRY,Can I speak with this Bookman?
S03E05,LIBRARIAN,Just a second.
S03E05,GEORGE,"Jerry, Jerry"
S03E05,JERRY,What?
S03E05,GEORGE,I think I saw him. I think it's him.
S03E05,JERRY,Who?
S03E05,GEORGE,Did you see the homeless guy on the library steps screaming obsenities and doing some calesthetics routine
S03E05,JERRY,Yeah.
S03E05,KRAMER,yeah
S03E05,GEORGE,I think that's Mr. Hayman. ...The gym teacher from our High School.
S03E05,READER,Shhh.
S03E05,JERRY,"(whispers) Haymen, Are you sure?"
S03E05,GEORGE,"He's older, completely covered in filth, no whistle, but I think it's him."
S03E05,JERRY,George got him fired. He squealed on him.
S03E05,KRAMER,Ooh tattle tale
S03E05,GEORGE,(yells) I didn't tattle
S03E05,READER,Shh Shh
S03E05,KRAMER,What did this guy do? What happened?
S03E05,GEORGE,There was an incident. I'd rather not discuss it.
S03E05,KRAMER,"Oh come on, You can tell me."
S03E05,GEORGE,Some other time.
S03E05,KRAMER,What tonight?
S03E05,KRAMER,Y'know I never figured you for a squealer.
S03E05,JERRY,"Oh, he sang like a canary."
S03E05,LIBRARIAN,Mr. Bookman's not here.
S03E05,JERRY,Not here? Why was I told to come down here?
S03E05,LIBRARIAN,He'll be out all afternoon on a case.
S03E05,KRAMER,He's out on a case? He actually goes out on cases?
S03E05,JERRY,Well what am I supposed to do now?
S03E05,LIBRARIAN,I'll have Mr. Bookman get in touch with you.
S03E05,JERRY,All right Thanks. Come on lets go
S03E05,GEORGE,Let's see if it's Hayman?
S03E05,KRAMER,"Hey, uh, I'll see you boys later. (TURNS TO LIBRARIAN) So uh, what's a guy got to do around here to get a library card?"
S03E05,ELAINE,Where's Karen?
S03E05,SECRETARY,She went to pick up lunch.
S03E05,ELAINE,"Well, she didn't ask me what I wanted."
S03E05,SECRETARY,She must have forgot.
S03E05,ELAINE,How could she forget I've been ordering lunch every day here for 3 and a half years?
S03E05,SECRETARY,I don't know anything.
S03E05,ELAINE,"Ah, you don't know anything. You see, ""I don't know anything"", means there's something to know. If you really didn't know anything you would have said ""You're crazy."""
S03E05,ELAINE,"Oh, hi Mr. Lippman."
S03E05,LIPPMAN,"Elaine,"
S03E05,ELAINE,"Um, uh, I was wondering if you got a chance to look at that , um, biography of Columbus, I gave you?"
S03E05,LIPPMAN,Yes I did. Yes I did. ... Maureen this water is still too cold.
S03E05,ELAINE,"Ooh yeah, It's freezing. ... Hurts your teeth."
S03E05,ELAINE,I'm tellin' ya' somethin' is goin' on. He never likes anything I recommend. And then that lunch thing.
S03E05,JERRY,So they forgot to get your lunch. Big deal!
S03E05,ELAINE,"What do you know. You've never worked in an office. (TURNS TO GEORGE) See, George, you've worked in an office. Jerry thinks I'm over reacting but you understand, ... LUNCH!"
S03E05,GEORGE,"I don't understand lunch, I don't know anything about lunch. Listen. Just because I got the guy fired doesn't mean I turned him into a bum - does it?"
S03E05,ELAINE,What did he do?
S03E05,GEORGE,"He purposely mispronounced my name. Instead of saying, ""Costanza"" He'd say, ""Can't stand ja"". ""Can't stand ja"" ... He made me smell my own gym socks once."
S03E05,JERRY,"I remember he made you wear a jock on your head for a whole class. And the straps were hangin' down by his ,..."
S03E05,GEORGE,"OK, OK, I never even had him for gym."
S03E05,JERRY,I had him for Hygene. Remember his teeth. It was like from an exhumed corpse.
S03E05,GEORGE,Little baked beans
S03E05,JERRY,Echh
S03E05,ELAINE,Come on tell me what happened.
S03E05,GEORGE,"Well, OK. As I said the guy had it in for me. He actually failed me in gym. ... ME!"
S03E05,GEORGE,... Those spastic shnitzer twins ...
S03E05,HEYMAN,Can't stand ja ... Can't stand ja
S03E05,GEORGE,"Yes, Mr. Hayman"
S03E05,HEYMAN,Your underwear was stick'n out of your shorts during gym class.
S03E05,GEORGE,Well I guess that's because I wear boxer shorts.
S03E05,HEYMAN,"Boxer shorts, ha ha, Well what brand?"
S03E05,GEORGE,"I'm not really sure, I..."
S03E05,HEYMAN,Well let's take a look.
S03E05,GEORGE,He gave me a wedgie.
S03E05,JERRY,He got fired the next day.
S03E05,ELAINE,Why do they call it a wedgie?
S03E05,GEORGE,Because the underwear is pulled up from the back and ... it wedges in..
S03E05,JERRY,They also have an atomic wedgie. Now the goal there is to actually get the waistband on top of the head. Very rare.
S03E05,ELAINE,Boys are sick.
S03E05,JERRY,Well what do girls do ?
S03E05,ELAINE,We just tease some one 'til they develop an eating disorder. guy who ruined his life.
S03E05,GEORGE,I gotta go back to the library and talk to him. I gotta find out if I&Mac226;m the guy who ruined his life.
S03E05,KRAMER,"Hey Babaloo, you better get home. You know this guy Bookman from the library he's waiting for ya."
S03E05,JERRY,"What's amazing to me about the library is it's a place where you go in you can take out any book you whant they just give it to you and say bring it back when you're done. It reminds me of like this pathetic friend that everbody had when they were a little kid who would let you borrow any of his stuff if you would just be his friend. That's what the library is. A government funded pathetic friend. And that's why everybody kinds of bullies the library. I'll bring it back on time ... I'll bring it back late. ... Oh, what are you going to do? Charge me a nickel?"
S03E05,JERRY,"Oh, I'm glad you're here, so we can get this all straightened out. Would you like a cup of tea?"
S03E05,BOOKMAN,You got any coffee?
S03E05,JERRY,Coffee?
S03E05,BOOKMAN,Yeah. Coffee.
S03E05,JERRY,"No, I don't drink coffee."
S03E05,BOOKMAN,"Yeah, you don't drink coffee? How about instant coffee?"
S03E05,JERRY,"No, I don't have--"
S03E05,BOOKMAN,You don't have any instant coffee?
S03E05,JERRY,"Well, I don't normally--"
S03E05,BOOKMAN,Who doesn't have instant coffee?
S03E05,JERRY,I don't.
S03E05,BOOKMAN,"You buy a jar of Folger's Crystals, you put it in the cupboard, you forget about it. Then later on when you need it, it's there. It lasts forever. It's freeze-dried. Freeze-dried Crystals."
S03E05,JERRY,Really? I'll have to remember that.
S03E05,BOOKMAN,You took this book out in 1971.
S03E05,JERRY,"Yes, and I returned it in 1971."
S03E05,BOOKMAN,"Yeah, '71. That was my first year on the job. Bad year for libraries. Bad year for America. Hippies burning library cards, Abby Hoffman telling everybody to steal books. I don't judge a man by the length of his hair or the kind of music he listens to. Rock was never my bag. But you put on a pair of shoes when you walk into the New York Public Library, fella."
S03E05,JERRY,"Look, Mr. Bookman. I--I returned that book. I remember it very specifically."
S03E05,BOOKMAN,"You're a comedian, you make people laugh."
S03E05,JERRY,I try.
S03E05,BOOKMAN,"You think this is all a big joke, don't you?"
S03E05,JERRY,"No, I don't."
S03E05,BOOKMAN,"I saw you on T.V. once; I remembered your name--from my list. I looked it up. Sure enough, it checked out. You think because you're a celebrity that somehow the law doesn't apply to you, that you're above the law?"
S03E05,JERRY,Certainly not.
S03E05,BOOKMAN,"Well, let me tell you something, funny boy. Y'know that little stamp, the one that says ""New York Public Library""? Well that may not mean anything to you, but that means a lot to me. One whole hell of a lot. Sure, go ahead, laugh if you want to. I've seen your type before Flashy, making the scene, flaunting convention. Yeah, I know what you're thinking. What's this guy making such a big stink about old library books? Well, let me give you a hint, junior. Maybe we can live without libraries, people like you and me. Maybe. Sure, we're too old to change the world, but what about that kid, sitting down, opening a book, right now, in a branch at the local library and finding drawings of pee-pees and wee-wees on the Cat in the Hat and the Five Chinese Brothers? Doesn't HE deserve better? Look. If you think this is about overdue fines and missing books, you'd better think again. This is about that kid's right to read a book without getting his mind warped! Or maybe that turns you on, Seinfeld; maybe that's how y'get your kicks. You and your good-time buddies. Well I got a flash for ya, joy-boy Party time is over. Y'got seven days, Seinfeld. That is one week!"
S03E05,KRAMER,What's wrong?
S03E05,MARION,It's Bookman the library cop.
S03E05,KRAMER,"So I, I didn't do anything wrong."
S03E05,MARION,I'm supposed to be at work. I could get fired. I shouldn't have come here.
S03E05,KRAMER,Why don't ya' leave?
S03E05,MARION,I can't.
S03E05,JERRY,"No way I'm payin' that! I returned that book in 1971. I have a witness Sherry Becker. She wore an orange dress. She gave me a piece of black jack gum. It's a licorice gum. What do ya' think of next I remember it. (thinks out loud, opens phone book) Becker, ... Becker, ..."
S03E05,SHERRY,"Kevin went to a public school, he's the 14 year old? We were gonna' send Marsha to a private school. Cause in some way they don't learn ... enough ... I think."
S03E05,JERRY,"So Sherry, what do you remember about that day at the library?"
S03E05,SHERRY,I remember it like it was yesterday. It was a Friday afternoon. I wore a purple dress.
S03E05,JERRY,Purple? Ya' sure it wasn't orange?
S03E05,SHERRY,Positive. And I was chewin' Dentyne. I always chewed dentyne. Remember Jerry? Dentyne?
S03E05,JERRY,No Black Jack?
S03E05,SHERRY,"Uch! Licorice gum? Never! We were ah, reading pasages to each other from that Henry Miller book,"
S03E05,JERRY,Tropic of Cancer.
S03E05,SHERRY,"No, Tropic of Capricorn"

S03E05,JERRY,Wait a second. Wait a second. You're right. I had both of them.
S03E05,JERRY,"George, here's the book. Don't let anybody see it. Don't let anything happen to it."
S03E05,GEORGE,"Jerry, it's me, George, don't worry, I'll return it"
S03E05,JERRY,"Ok, I'll see you after school. I.m late for Hayman's hygiene."
S03E05,SHERRY,Where ya' going?
S03E05,JERRY,It was nice seeing you again. I just remembered something. I've got to go. (to old man that enters) It was GEORGE!
S03E05,KRAMER,Read another poem.
S03E05,MARION,Pressed chest fleshed out west Might be the saviour or a garden pest.
S03E05,KRAMER,"Wow, that is great. You should be published."
S03E05,KRAMER,"You know, the library is kind of a cool place when it's closed."
S03E05,MARIAN,"Oh, yeah. You don't have to be quiet. Listen to the echo HELLO!"
S03E05,KRAMER,HELLO!
S03E05,MARIAN,HELLO!
S03E05,KRAMER,HELLO!
S03E05,MARIAN,HELLO!
S03E05,BOOKMAN (emerging),Hello!
S03E05,"MARIAN (turning, surprised)",Mr. Bookman.
S03E05,BOOKMAN,"I remember when the librarian was a much older woman Kindly, discreet, unattractive. We didn't know anything about her private life. We didn't want to know anything about her private life. She didn't have a private life. While you're thinking about that, think about this The library closes at five o'clock, no exceptions. This is your final warning. Got that, kewpie-doll?"
S03E05,ELAINE,Lippman want's to see me in his office SEE ME! That can't be good
S03E05,JERRY,Maybe you're getting' a raise.
S03E05,ELAINE,Maybe I'm getting' a wedgie.
S03E05,ELAINE,What?
S03E05,GEORGE,It's George
S03E05,ELAINE,George is on his way up.
S03E05,JERRY,Wait 'til I tell him about the book.
S03E05,KRAMER,(reading) sobs
S03E05,ELAINE,Are you OK? What? What?
S03E05,KRAMER,It's Marion's poetry. I can't take it (leaves sobbing)
S03E05,ELAINE,Remember that biography I recommended? MY BOSS HATED IT
S03E05,JERRY,I'm right here.
S03E05,ELAINE,Remember that Columbus book?
S03E05,JERRY,"Columbus, Euro trash."
S03E05,GEORGE,"Well, it's definetly him."
S03E05,ELAINE,Him? Him who?
S03E05,GEORGE,Him who? Hayman him.
S03E05,ELAINE,Hayman The gym teacher? You found him?
S03E05,GEORGE,"Oh, I found him. He was sitting on the steps of the library. I sat down next to him. He smelled like the locker room after that game against Erasmus"
S03E05,JERRY,That was double overtime.
S03E05,GEORGE,"So I said, ""Mr. Hayman, It's me george Costanza, JFK, ... "" He doesn't move. So I said uh, ""Can't stand ya'"", ""Can't stand ya'"" He turns and smiles, the little baked bean teeth. I get up to run away, but something was holding me back. It was Heyman. He had my underwear. There I was on the steps of the 42nd St. library , a grown man, getting a wedgie."
S03E05,ELAINE,At least it wasn't atomic.
S03E05,GEORGE,It was.
S03E05,JERRY,"So Georgie Boy, guess what happened to TROPIC OF CANCER"
S03E05,GEORGE,How should I know?
S03E05,JERRY,Because I gave it to you.
S03E05,GEORGE,Me?
S03E05,JERRY,"Yeah, think. Don't you remember you kept begging me to see it then finally I agreed. You were supposed to return it. I met you in the gym locker room."
S03E05,GEORGE,The locker room!
S03E05,JERRY,Here's the book. Don't let anybody see it. Don't let anything happen to it.
S03E05,GEORGE,"Jerry, it's me, George, don't worry, I'll return it tomorrow, no problem."
S03E05,JERRY,"All right, I'll see you after school. I,,m late for Hayman's hygiene."
S03E05,HEYMAN,Can't Stand Ya'.
S03E05,GEORGE,Yes Mr. Hayman.
S03E05,HEYMAN,Your underwear was stick'n out of your shorts during gym class.
S03E05,GEORGE,Well I guess that's because I wear boxer shorts.
S03E05,HEYMAN,"Boxer shorts, ha? Well what brand?"
S03E05,GEORGE,"I'm not really sure, I..."
S03E05,HEYMAN,Well let's take a look.
S03E05,GEORGE,(shouting) No No No!
S03E05,JERRY,"Anyway, I hope there's no hard feelings."
S03E05,BOOKMAN,Hard feelings? What do you know about hard feelings? Y'ever have a man die in your arms? Y'ever kill somebody?
S03E05,JERRY,What is your problem?
S03E05,BOOKMAN,"What's my problem? Punks like you, that's my problem. And you better not screw up again Seinfeld, because if you do, I'll be all over you like a pitbull on a poodle."
S03E05,JERRY,(after Bookman exits) That is one tough monkey! (turns to Elaine) So you were saying?
S03E05,ELAINE,"Oh? So, I took your suggestion and I gave my boss Marion's poems. The ones that affected Kramer so much."
S03E05,JERRY,"Oh, beautiful did he like them?"
S03E05,ELAINE,"No, ... he didn't! No, ... he didn't!"
S03E05,JERRY,(to George) Was he out there?
S03E05,GEORGE,"Na, he's gone. I wonder what happened to him."
S03E05,JERRY,I guess we'll never know.
S03E05,HEYMAN,"Can't stand ya, (laughing) Can't stand ya. (pan to TROPIC OF CANCER on ground)"
S03E05,JERRY,"Any day that you had gym it was a weird school day, you know what I mean because it kind of like started of kind of normal. You have like English, Geometry, Social Studies and then suddenly you're like in Lord of The Flies for 40 minutes you know you're hangin' from a rope. You have hardly any clothes on. Teachers are yellin' at ya' ""Where's your jock strap?"" Ya' know and kids are throwin' dodge balls at you. You're tryin' to survive ... Then its History, Science, Language. There's something off in the entire flow of that day."

S03E06,GEORGE,One left...what a joke.
S03E06,KRAMER,You can have this one.
S03E06,GEORGE,"No, that's not enough BTUs for my living room...That was a complete waste of time."
S03E06,ELAINE,"Hey, I didn't get one either."
S03E06,JERRY,Why do I always have the feeling that everybody's doing something better than me on Saturday afternoons?
S03E06,ELAINE,This is what people do.
S03E06,JERRY,No they don't. They're out on some big picnic. They're cooking burgers. They're making out on blankets. They're not at some mall in Jersey watching their friends trying to find the world's cheapest air-conditioner.
S03E06,GEORGE,You should see what my father used to go through before he bought a car. He'd go from state to state. He was away for weeks at a time. It was like he was running for President and he was going through the primaries. We'd get phone calls from motels in New Hampshire.
S03E06,ELAINE,So we took a little ride. What's the big deal?
S03E06,GEORGE,Well at least you accomplished something. You got fish.
S03E06,JERRY,Big accomplishment.
S03E06,GEORGE,Fish. What do they do?
S03E06,ELAINE,What do you do?
S03E06,KRAMER,It's this way.
S03E06,GEORGE,What time is it?
S03E06,JERRY,Five o'clock.
S03E06,GEORGE,Always late. Always late.
S03E06,JERRY,You're not late.
S03E06,GEORGE,I told them to meet me in front of my building at six-fifteen.
S03E06,ELAINE,Who?
S03E06,GEORGE,My parents. It's their anniversary. I'm taking them out to dinner and a show tonight. You think we'll hit traffic?
S03E06,JERRY,Of course we'll hit traffic. It's rush hour.
S03E06,ELAINE,Isn't it going the other way?
S03E06,JERRY,There is no other way in New York. Everybody goes every way all the time.
S03E06,ELAINE,But it's Saturday.
S03E06,JERRY,You got the picnic and burger traffic.
S03E06,GEORGE,I always get myself in this position. Can't be on time. Gotta rush.
S03E06,ELAINE,What's the matter?
S03E06,JERRY,I have to go to the bathroom. Why do they hide the bathroom in these malls?
S03E06,JERRY,(CONT'D) You want me to help you with that?
S03E06,KRAMER,"No, no, I got it."
S03E06,JERRY,"(TO GEORGE, REWOMAN) What do you think, Georgie boy?"
S03E06,GEORGE,"Did I need that pointed out for me? What is that going to do for me? How does that help me, to see her? I'm trying to live my life. Don't show me that."
S03E06,KRAMER,"If you like her, go talk to her."
S03E06,GEORGE,"Yeah, right. I'll just go up and say, ""Hi, how ya' doing? Would you like a glass of white wine?"" JERRY Before you got within twenty feet of this woman, she'd have her finger on the mace button. She's like an expensive car with one of those motion-sensor force field alarms. Any sudden movement in the area could set her off."
S03E06,KRAMER,She's fat.
S03E06,ELAINE,Oh she's fat?
S03E06,ELAINE,What? JERRY Where's the car?
S03E06,KRAMER,I thought it was here.
S03E06,GEORGE,You don't know where we parked?
S03E06,GEORGE,"Oh, this is great."
S03E06,KRAMER,Blue-one. I thought it was blue-one.
S03E06,JERRY,I thought it was green. I remember seeing green.
S03E06,ELAINE,I didn't pay attention.
S03E06,GEORGE,This is just what I need.
S03E06,ELAINE,I'm sure it's right around here.
S03E06,KRAMER,It looks familiar. I remember the elevator.
S03E06,GEORGE,There's elevators all over! It all looks the same.
S03E06,JERRY,It's over there. I know where it is.
S03E06,ELAINE,"It's black, right?"
S03E06,KRAMER,Dark blue.
S03E06,GEORGE,"(MUMBLING) You come to a parking lot, you write it down. How hard is that?"
S03E06,JERRY,"There it is!...No, no that's a Toyota."
S03E06,JERRY,(CONT'D) Hmmm...I thought it was...
S03E06,KRAMER,Didn't we come in over there?
S03E06,JERRY,I thought it was over there.
S03E06,ELAINE,How long can fish live in one of these plastic bags?
S03E06,KRAMER,About two hours.
S03E06,ELAINE,(SHE LOOKS AT HER WATCH) You'd better find this car.
S03E06,GEORGE,"It's this way... AND THEY TAKE OFF AGAIN, PAIRING OFF"
S03E06,JERRY,I really have to go to the bathroom.
S03E06,KRAMER,Why don't you go behind one of these cars? J
S03E06,KRAMER,(CONT'D) Why? Nobody's around.
S03E06,JERRY,I'll wait.
S03E06,KRAMER,You know when you hold it in like that you can cause a lot of damage to your bladder. That's what happens to truck drivers. They hold it in all the time. Eventually it starts coming out involuntarily.
S03E06,JERRY,Alright.
S03E06,KRAMER,"Jerry, are you aware that adult diapers are a six hundred million dollar a year industry?"
S03E06,JERRY,Maybe I should just go anytime I get the urge like you...wherever I am. There's too much urinary freedom in this society. I'm proud to hold it in. It builds character.
S03E06,ELAINE,(RE CAR) There it is!...No that's not it.
S03E06,ELAINE,"(CONT'D) Hey, watch it. ...Did you see that car? Maniac. Can you explain something to me? I got six questions wrong on my drivers test. That's the maximum. I read the book, I'm a college graduate. This is a country where fifty percent of its high school students can't locate Europe on a map. How are they all passing that test? It's a mystery."
S03E06,GEORGE,...Six wrong?
S03E06,ELAINE,Those school zones are a killer.
S03E06,JERRY,"(TO KRAMER, REBOX) Will you let me help you with that?"
S03E06,KRAMER,I'm gonna put it down behind that car.
S03E06,JERRY,You're not worried somebody's gonna pee on it?
S03E06,KRAMER,(TO GEORGE) Pink eleven. Remember that.
S03E06,GEORGE,"Oh I got it. (TO JERRY) That I'm supposed to remember. Where the car is, that's insignificant."
S03E06,ELAINE,(LOOKING AT FISH) I think they're laboring.
S03E06,KRAMER,Look at this place. It's huge...
S03E06,GEORGE,"I can tell you this. If I am not in front of my house at six-fifteen, when my parents get there, they will put me on an aggravation installment plan that will compound with interest for decades."
S03E06,JERRY,"Parents never forget a foul-up. I once left a jacket on the bus when I was fourteen. Last week I'm flying to Chicago to do a show, ""Make sure you hang on to your jacket."""
S03E06,GEORGE,"Where the hell is this car, Kramer?"
S03E06,KRAMER,It's got to be here.
S03E06,ELAINE,Why are they using so many colors? And the numbers go up to forty.
S03E06,JERRY,Maybe it's not on this level.
S03E06,GEORGE,What?
S03E06,JERRY,There are four different levels. Maybe we're on the wrong level. How long was the escalator ride up?
S03E06,ELAINE,It felt like a couple of levels.
S03E06,JERRY,You should always carry a pad and pen.
S03E06,GEORGE,I can't carry a pen. I'm afraid I'll puncture my scrotum.
S03E06,KRAMER,I have a pen.
S03E06,JERRY,"Where was the bathroom in this mall? There are six-hundred stores, I didn't see one bathroom. What is this, like a joke? They finished building the mall and they go, ""Oh my god, we forgot the bathrooms."""
S03E06,MOTHER,(O.C.) Don't you dare talk to me like that! You hear me?
S03E06,ELAINE,Look at that woman.
S03E06,MOTHER,I told you! I don't care! You'll have to wait.
S03E06,GEORGE,"(TO WOMAN) Hey, is that necessary?"
S03E06,MOTHER,(TO GEORGE) Why don't you mind your own business?
S03E06,GEORGE,I think hitting a defenseless child is my business.
S03E06,KID,(TO GEORGE) You're ugly.
S03E06,GEORGE,...What?
S03E06,KID,You're ugly.
S03E06,GEORGE,You are!
S03E06,KID,You are!
S03E06,GEORGE,I should've hit the little son-of-a-bitch. I can't stand kids. Adults think it's so wonderful how honest kids are. I don't need that kind of honesty. I'll take a deceptive adult over an honest kid any day.
S03E06,KRAMER,(RE CAR) I found it!
S03E06,ELAINE,He's got it.
S03E06,KRAMER,Oh...no.
S03E06,JERRY,"All right, that's it. From now on no more calling out they found it, unless we're sitting in it. Okay?"
S03E06,ELAINE,"Jerry, look at my fish."
S03E06,JERRY,His eyes look a little cloudy.
S03E06,GEORGE,Oh are they gonna be furious.
S03E06,JERRY,Who's got the tickets? GEORGE I do. (TO KRAMER) I thought you knew this mall. You said you'd been here before!
S03E06,KRAMER,It was easy the last time.
S03E06,ELAINE,My fish are dying right in front of me! We have to get someone to drive us around the parking lot to help us look for the car.
S03E06,JERRY,No one's going to do that.
S03E06,ELAINE,"Excuse me, we can't seem to find our car. I was wondering if it would be possible if you're not in a hurry, to drive us around the garage for five minutes so we can look."
S03E06,MAN #1,(HOLDING HIS HANDS UP) ...Sorry.
S03E06,ELAINE,Five minutes.
S03E06,MAN #1,Can't do it.
S03E06,ELAINE,We're not wilding.
S03E06,ELAINE,(CONT'D) Excuse me - I can't seem to find my car - do you think you could drive me...
S03E06,ELAINE,(CONT'D) Oh that's funny? Is that funny? Well tell me if you think this is funny These fish are dying! They're gasping for oxygen right now! They'll be floating in an hour. Is that funny too?
S03E06,JERRY,Those are really ugly sneakers. Where did you get those?
S03E06,KRAMER,Right here at the mall.
S03E06,ELAINE,Excuse me...
S03E06,ELAINE,"(CONT'D) Sorry to have disturbed you. Terribly sorry. But the fish will be dead. You do know that. They can't live in plastic. That's not me talking, that's science."
S03E06,JERRY,It's amazing how shopping makes me have to go. All I have to do is walk into a department store and it's like some kind of horse laxative just kicked in.
S03E06,KRAMER,You drank a whole bottle of water.
S03E06,JERRY,I know.
S03E06,KRAMER,So why don't you just go?
S03E06,JERRY,No I can't.
S03E06,KRAMER,Don't you get tired of following rules?
S03E06,JERRY,You think I'm too cautious?
S03E06,KRAMER,Why be uncomfortable if you don't have to? It's organic.
S03E06,JERRY,Organic. So's Buddy Hackett.
S03E06,KRAMER,Buddy Hackett?
S03E06,JERRY,He's a comedian.
S03E06,KRAMER,I know.
S03E06,JERRY,All right. All right.
S03E06,KRAMER,(pointing) You can go over here.
S03E06,JERRY,I can manage.
S03E06,KRAMER,(turns away and spots George) George! (leaves scene)
S03E06,KRAMER,It'll take you ten seconds.
S03E06,JERRY,"Okay, okay. I'll be right back."
S03E06,SECURITY GUARD,"Okay, let's go. Come with me."
S03E06,JERRY,But...
S03E06,SECURITY GUARD,Come on.
S03E06,JERRY,"(STARTS TO LEAVE, TO HIMSELF) ...Kramer"
S03E06,JERRY,"I've had this condition since I was eleven! I've been in and out of hospitals my whole life. I have no control over it. Doctors have told me that when I feel it, the best thing to do is just release it. Otherwise, I could die."
S03E06,SECURITY GUARD,Well you're still not allowed.
S03E06,JERRY,"Do you hear what I'm saying to you?! I'm telling you that if I don't go, I could die. Die. Is it worth dying for?"
S03E06,SECURITY GUARD,That's up to you.
S03E06,JERRY,So you don't care if I die.
S03E06,SECURITY GUARD,What I care about is the sanitary condition of the parking facility.
S03E06,JERRY,It was life and death.
S03E06,SECURITY GUARD,Uh huh.
S03E06,JERRY,Oh I'm lying. Why would I do it unless I was in mortal danger? I know it's against the law.
S03E06,SECURITY GUARD,I don't know.
S03E06,JERRY,"Because I could get Uromysitisis poisoning and die. That's why!...Do you think I enjoy living like this?...the shame, the humiliation...You know I have been issued a public urination pass by the city because of my condition. Unfortunately my little brother ran out of the house with it this morning."
S03E06,JERRY,"(C0NT'D) Him and his friends are probably peeing all over the place. You want to call the Department of Social Services? Oh, it's Saturday. They're closed today. My luck."
S03E06,SECURITY GUARD,You can tell the police all about it.
S03E06,KRAMER,(CALLING OUT) Jerry!
S03E06,ELAINE,Jerry!
S03E06,GEORGE,"Unbelievable, I'm never gonna get out of here. The guy goes to pee, he never comes back. It's like a science fiction story."
S03E06,ELAINE,Maybe he went to one of the other levels. I'll go look for him.
S03E06,GEORGE,Oh now you're gonna go? ELAINE I'll be back in five minutes.
S03E06,GEORGE,"If you go now, I know what's gonna happen. We'll find the car, Jerry will show up, and then we'll never find you."
S03E06,ELAINE,"No, no, I'll be back."
S03E06,GEORGE,Oh what's the difference? We'll all be dead eventually.
S03E06,KRAMER,Does that bother you?
S03E06,GEORGE,"Yeah, it bothers me. Doesn't it bother you?"
S03E06,KRAMER,Not at all.
S03E06,GEORGE,"See now that bothers me even more than dying bothers me, cause it's people like you who live to be a hundred and twenty because you're not bothered by it. How could it not bother you?"
S03E06,KRAMER,I once saw this thing on T.V. with people who are terminally ill. And they all believed the secret of life is just to live every moment.
S03E06,GEORGE,"Yeah, yeah. I've heard that. Meanwhile I'm here with you in a parking garage, what am I supposed to do?"
S03E06,JERRY,First of all you don't even know technically that I went. That's for starters. I mean I could've been pouring a bottle of water out there. You don't know.
S03E06,SECURITY GUARD,I know what you did.
S03E06,JERRY,"Oh really, do you? Well it just so happens that I did pour water out. I had a bottle of very tepid water and I poured it out. And I could see how you made a mistake, because pouring water out sounds very much like a person urinating."
S03E06,JERRY,(CONT'D) And you know when you think about it it's really quite an amusing case of mistaken identity. That's all it is.
S03E06,SECURITY GUARD,Yeah I'm sure.
S03E06,JERRY,You know this is not the first time this has happened to me. I always carry water because of my condition. It dehydrates me. It's a vicious cycle.
S03E06,ELAINE,"And now he's gone. I'm sure he's looking for the car. Five minutes, that's all. I just want to find him."
S03E06,MAN #1,I can't do it.
S03E06,ELAINE,But why? Why can't you do it?
S03E06,MAN #1,I can't.
S03E06,ELAINE,"No, see that's not a reason you can't. You just don't want to."
S03E06,MAN #1,That's right.
S03E06,ELAINE,But why? Why don't you want to?
S03E06,MAN #1,I don't know.
S03E06,ELAINE,But wouldn't you get any satisfaction out of helping someone out?
S03E06,MAN #,"1 No, I wouldn't."
S03E06,JERRY,"(A NEW TACK) All right, all right. I want to apologize. I was frightened, I said crazy things. I obviously offended you. I insulted your intelligence. The uromysitisis, the water bottle...I made it all up, and now...I'm going to tell you the truth. Today my father and mother are celebrating their fiftieth, well I'm jumping ahead here, their forty-seventh wedding anniversary. We made arrangements to spend the evening together. They are supposed to be in front of my building at six-fifteen."
S03E06,JERRY,"(CONT'D) What I haven't told you, or anyone else for that matter, is that my father's been in a Red Chinese prison for the past fourteen years."
S03E06,KRAMER,The guy's got a fat fetish. Spector never dates a woman under two hundred-fifty pounds.
S03E06,GEORGE,(NOT INTERESTED) Really.
S03E06,KRAMER,What does he do with all that fat? Does he just jump up and down on it? Does he gouge it like Killer Kowalski?
S03E06,GEORGE,Who's Killer Kowalski?
S03E06,KRAMER,He was a wrestler. He would grab hold of someone's stomach and just squeeze it until they gave.
S03E06,GEORGE,I've gotta go to the bathroom.
S03E06,KRAMER,So go. GEORGE Here?
S03E06,KRAMER,(SHAKING HIS HEAD) You and Jerry.
S03E06,GEORGE,Don't you believe me? It's their fiftieth anniversary. You know this is gonna kill him. You're aware of that. Kill him. On the biggest night of his life...
S03E06,SECURITY GUARD,Oh your folks have an anniversary today too?
S03E06,JERRY,(TO GEORGE) Was he also in a Red Chinese prison?
S03E06,GEORGE,"(TO JERRY, SOMEWHAT IMPRESSED) A Red Chinese prison?"
S03E06,KRAMER,George! George!
S03E06,ELAINE,Jerry! (THEN SHE CHECKS HER FISH)
S03E06,JERRY,"Well what happened was my father was staying in the home of one of Red China's great military leaders, General Chang, who by the way came up with the recipe for General Chang's chicken. You know, the one with the red peppers and orange peel at Szechwan Gardens? GEORGE Sure, I have it all the time. Very spicy."
S03E06,JERRY,"Well General Chang was a very flamboyant man. A complete failure as a general, but a helluva cook."
S03E06,ELAINE,(O.C.) Jerry! JERRY Elaine?!
S03E06,ELAINE,(O.C.) Jerry! Over here...
S03E06,ELAINE,(CONT'D) Where have you been?
S03E06,JERRY,I was arrested for urinating.
S03E06,GEORGE,(PROUDLY) Me too.
S03E06,ELAINE,You what?
S03E06,JERRY,I have uromysitisis. It's very serious you know.
S03E06,ELAINE,Look at my fish... (JERRY EXAMINES IT) Is he...
S03E06,JERRY,"No, but he's not looking good... (ELAINE TURNS TO TWO HUGE BODY BUILDERS IN WORKOUT WEAR)"
S03E06,ELAINE,"(DESPERATE) Please, we can't find our car. Please drive us around the parking lot to find our car. My fish are dying."
S03E06,MAN #2,Can't do it.
S03E06,ELAINE,"I can see not caring what happens to us, we're human. But what about the fish? The fish?"
S03E06,MAN #3,Sorry. (THEY KEEP WALKING.)
S03E06,ELAINE,"That's right, go. Go home to your dumbbells. Work on your pecs. I'm really impressed."
S03E06,ELAINE,(CONT'D) That's right you heard me. You got a problem with that?
S03E06,GEORGE,"Elaine, shut-up."
S03E06,JERRY,"Hey, where's Kramer?"
S03E06,GEORGE,I don't know. (TO ELAINE) Where's Kramer?
S03E06,ELAINE,I thought he was with you.
S03E06,GEORGE,"See, I knew it. I knew this was gonna happen..."
S03E06,GEORGE,"(CONT'D) Look at the time, that's it."
S03E06,ELAINE,Have we looked over there? Have we checked that side?
S03E06,GEORGE,We came in over there!
S03E06,ELAINE,We didn't come in over there!
S03E06,JERRY,Where's Kramer?
S03E06,JERRY,"Hey George, there she is again. ..."
S03E06,GEORGE,So what do you want me to do?
S03E06,JERRY,Ask her to drive us around. There's your opening.
S03E06,GEORGE,That is an opening.
S03E06,GEORGE,"(CONT'D) Excuse me...I really... What's happened is that my friend forgot where he parked and if you're not in a big hurry, we'd really appreciate it if..."
S03E06,AMY,"Oh sure, I'll drive you around."
S03E06,GEORGE,You will?
S03E06,AMY,Sure.
S03E06,GEORGE,Thanks a lot. I'm really late. My parents are waiting in front of my building and we're stuck here.
S03E06,AMY,I wouldn't want to get lost in here. It smells like a toilet. People are such animals.
S03E06,GEORGE,"Yeah, right."
S03E06,JERRY,Filthy pigs.
S03E06,GEORGE,It's a blue Honda...
S03E06,AMY,This has happened to me too. It's very frustrating.
S03E06,ELAINE,"Hi, I'm Elaine."
S03E06,JERRY,Jerry.
S03E06,AMY,Hello.
S03E06,ELAINE,It's very nice of you to do this. I've asked several people and they wouldn't even answer me.
S03E06,AMY,I'm happy to do it. (TO GEORGE) I'm Amy.
S03E06,GEORGE,"Hi Amy, I'm George."
S03E06,GEORGE,(TALKING IN PASSENGER WINDOW) I didn't mean anything by it. I don't even know L. Ron Hubbard! I didn't know you were...
S03E06,GEORGE,(CONT'D) ...with that group.
S03E06,ELAINE,(SHOUTING TO AMY) What about my fish?
S03E06,JERRY,"Boy, those Scientologists. They can be pretty sensitive."
S03E06,ELAINE,I'll say.
S03E06,ELAINE,What is it? (THEY DISCOVER WHAT HE'S STARING AT) The car!
S03E06,JERRY,The car!
S03E06,GEORGE,The car!
S03E06,ELAINE,We found it. I can't believe it!
S03E06,GEORGE,"Kramer, Kramer's not here...I knew it. I knew it! I knew this would happen. (SCREAMING) Kramer! Kramer!"
S03E06,JERRY,Kramer!
S03E06,JERRY,Kramer.
S03E06,KRAMER,Jerry?
S03E06,JERRY,"Yeah, over here."
S03E06,KRAMER,Boy I had a helluva time finding that air-conditioner. I looked everywhere. I completely forgot where I hid it. You know where it was?
S03E06,GEORGE,Purple 23.
S03E06,KRAMER,Right! Purple 23. I could've used you.
S03E06,GEORGE,Sometimes it's good to have a pencil to write these things down.
S03E06,KRAMER,What time is it?
S03E06,GEORGE,Seven forty-five.
S03E06,KRAMER,Well at least there's no traffic.
S03E06,GEORGE,Right.
S03E06,KRAMER,What time does that play start?
S03E06,GEORGE,Eight o'clock.
S03E06,KRAMER,That might be a problem. (TO ELAINE) Where's your little bag of...
S03E06,KRAMER,(CONT'D) Oh...(TAKES OUT PARKING STUB) Boy this garage is going to cost a fortune. You know how long we were here?
S03E07,GEORGE,"She thinks I'm a nice guy. Women always think I'm nice, but women don'tnice."
S03E07,JERRY,"This is amazing, I haven't seen one person go in to that restaurant since it opened. Poor guy."
S03E07,GEORGE,"Why is nice bad? What kind a of sick society we are living in, when nice is bad?"
S03E07,JERRY,What's that smell? What are you wearing?
S03E07,GEORGE,"What, a 'little' cologne."
S03E07,JERRY,Manly.
S03E07,GEORGE,Monica wants me to wear it.
S03E07,JERRY,So why didn't you say no?
S03E07,GEORGE,I'm too nice.
S03E07,JERRY,Look at this poor guy. His family is probably in Pakistan -- they're waiting him to send back money. This is horrible.
S03E07,GEORGE,She wants me to take an IQ test.
S03E07,JERRY,That's because you're stupid enough to wear the cologne.
S03E07,GEORGE,"No, she's taking this course in education for her masters. It's part of her research project, so I have to be a guinea pig."
S03E07,JERRY,"I've never been a guinea pig. I've been a sheep, a tody."
S03E07,GEORGE,"You know, I can't talk to you anymore."
S03E07,JERRY,"All right, I'm sorry. Go ahead, you're taking the IQ test."
S03E07,GEORGE,"Yeah, and she's going to find I'm a moron. You know, people think I'm smart, but I'm not smart."
S03E07,JERRY,Who thinks you're smart?
S03E07,GEORGE,I'm not going to break a hundred on this thing.
S03E07,JERRY,What thing?
S03E07,GEORGE,You don't listen when people talk to you anymore!
S03E07,JERRY,"Oh, Oh, the IQ thing...yeah."
S03E07,GEORGE,I'm sure I have a low IQ. I've been lying about my SAT scores for 15 years.
S03E07,JERRY,What'd ya get?
S03E07,GEORGE,What did I get or what do I say I got?
S03E07,JERRY,What do you say?
S03E07,GEORGE,I say fourteen o nine (1409).
S03E07,JERRY,"1409, that's a good score."
S03E07,GEORGE,"Psst, You're telling me."
S03E07,JERRY,What did you really get?
S03E07,GEORGE,You are my friend.
S03E07,JERRY,Of course.
S03E07,GEORGE,"I tell you everything, right?"
S03E07,JERRY,I hope so.
S03E07,GEORGE,"Well, this I take to the grave."
S03E07,JERRY,"He's serving Mexican, Italian, Chinese. He's all over the place. That's why no one's going in."
S03E07,ELAINE,Why do you keep watching?
S03E07,JERRY,"I don't know, I'm obsessed with it. It's like a spider in the toilet struggling for survival. And even though ya know he's not going to make it, y-y-you kind of root for him for a second."
S03E07,ELAINE,And then you flush.
S03E07,JERRY,"Well, it's a spider."
S03E07,ELAINE,"You know, sometimes people won't go in a place, if they don't see anyone else in there."
S03E07,ELAINE,"Do you have to do that? Jerry, don't do that, that is so annoying."
S03E07,JERRY,Bazooka Joe.
S03E07,JERRY,The buzzer.
S03E07,ELAINE,It's your house.
S03E07,JERRY,My house? You gotta be on the lease to press to buzzer. Yeah? (to the intercom)
S03E07,INTERCOM,It's George.
S03E07,JERRY,Come on up.
S03E07,ELAINE,Casus belli.
S03E07,JERRY,What's that?
S03E07,ELAINE,"It's Latin. I read it in some book. I don't know, I just wanted to say it out loud."
S03E07,JERRY,"Come on, Go in, go in! [watching Dream Cafe with binoculars again]"
S03E07,ELAINE,Have you gone in there?
S03E07,JERRY,"No, I'm afraid we'll start talking, and I'll gonna wind up going partners with him."
S03E07,GEORGE,Hey.
S03E07,JERRY,"You know, I could probably shoot him from here. I'd be doing us both a favor."
S03E07,GEORGE,"I'm wearing some cologne, all right?"
S03E07,ELAINE,"Sure, fine."
S03E07,JERRY,Casus belli.
S03E07,ELAINE,Casus belli.
S03E07,GEORGE,What's that?
S03E07,ELAINE,Since when do you wear cologne?
S03E07,GEORGE,"Why is what I do is so important? Why must I be always the focal point of attention? Let me just be, let me live."
S03E07,JERRY,"Hey, how'd you do on that IQ test?"
S03E07,GEORGE,"I didn't take it, yet."
S03E07,ELAINE,What IQ test?
S03E07,GEORGE,What's casus belli.
S03E07,JERRY,"Oh, it's nothing..."
S03E07,GEORGE,Is it about me?
S03E07,JERRY,Why must you always be the focal point of attention? Why can't you just be? (Elaine laughs - hu) Why can't you live?
S03E07,ELAINE,"It's just a Latin phrase George, it does not mean anything. Now, what is this test?"
S03E07,JERRY,This woman he's dating is making him take this IQ test for this course.
S03E07,ELAINE,"Oh, that sounds like fun."
S03E07,GEORGE,"Yeah, fun. IQ tests are totally bogus. They prove nothing."
S03E07,ELAINE,"You'll do well, you're smart."
S03E07,JERRY,"No see, he's not smart. People think he's smart, but he's not."
S03E07,ELAINE,Wha'd you get on your SAT's?
S03E07,GEORGE,It varies.
S03E07,JERRY,"You know, I don't even know my IQ."
S03E07,ELAINE,"huh, Mine's 145."
S03E07,GEORGE,145!
S03E07,JERRY,Get out of here!
S03E07,ELAINE,You get out of here!
S03E07,JERRY,You get out of here!
S03E07,ELAINE,Huhuhuhuhuhuhu (laughing)
S03E07,GEORGE,"Shst, You should take the test for me."
S03E07,ELAINE,Huh.
S03E07,JERRY,"Boy that'd be something, cheating on a IQ test."
S03E07,GEORGE,Haha (laughs)
S03E07,JERRY,"Hey, remember in college when you passed Lettick the test out the window? You became a legend after that. (stepping over Elaine then George's legs to get to the large blue chair and sits down.)"
S03E07,GEORGE,"Yeah, yeah I really had some guts back then. Why don't we do it again?"
S03E07,ELAINE,What?
S03E07,GEORGE,"You could take the IQ test for me. I could pass it to you out a window. We could do it, she lives in the first floor."
S03E07,ELAINE,Are you serious?
S03E07,GEORGE,Why not?
S03E07,ELAINE,Where would I take the test?
S03E07,GEORGE,"I don't know, she lives right around the corner. You could take it here or go to the coffee shop."
S03E07,ELAINE,"No, that'd be too noisy."
S03E07,JERRY,"Take it to Dream Cafe, you won't hear a peep."
S03E07,ELAINE,"Hey, what do you think?"
S03E07,JERRY,"Hey, I love a good caper."
S03E07,ELAINE,"Yeah, that's what is, isn't it? A caper. Huh."
S03E07,GEORGE,You'll do it?
S03E07,ELAINE,What the hey.
S03E07,GEORGE,"Yeaah, beautiful... (They try to hit a high five, but George hits Elaine in the forehead.) Sorry..."
S03E07,Babu Bhatt,Welcome to the Dream Cafe.
S03E07,JERRY,"Well, ah, I've been looking forward to it."
S03E07,BABU,"Oh, ah how did you hear about us?"
S03E07,JERRY,"Eh, people, people are talking."
S03E07,BABU,Smoking or non-smoking? We are proud to offer both.
S03E07,JERRY,"Ah, non-smoking would be great."
S03E07,BABU,"Very good. My name is Babu Bhatt, I will be your waiter. A steaming hot folded face cloth for your pleasure."
S03E07,JERRY,Thank you. [Throws the towel around like a hot potato.]
S03E07,BABU,"Our specials are tacos, moussaka and franks and beans."
S03E07,JERRY,"Well, ah w-what do you recommend my good fellow?"
S03E07,BABU,"Oh, the turkey."
S03E07,JERRY,"Well then the turkey it'll be. And may I say you have a splendid establishment here, my friend. I'm sure you flourish at this location for many, many years."
S03E07,BABU,"You're very kind man. Very kind, thank you. Very kind..."
S03E07,JERRY,"(thinks) Very kind. I am a kind man. Who else would do something like this? Nobody. Nobody thinks about people the way I do. All right, snap out of it you stupid jerk. You're eating a turkey sandwich. What do want, a Nobel Prize?"
S03E07,GEORGE,You go in the living room. I'll take the test in here.
S03E07,MONICA,But why?
S03E07,GEORGE,"I won't be able to, concentrate in front of you."
S03E07,MONICA,"Oh, I think you're making too much of this. IQ tests don't mean anything."
S03E07,GEORGE,Are you kidding me? [Elaine walks past the window glancing in] This is the best tool we have today of measuring a persons' intelligence.
S03E07,MONICA,"Well, I certainly don't place any importance on it."
S03E07,GEORGE,"Well, I think you're wrong about that. [Elaine walks past the window again, glancing in] And ah now if you'll excuse me, I'd really like to get started, please."
S03E07,MONICA,Good luck.
S03E07,GEORGE,Don't need it. N'huhuhu (laughs)
S03E07,ELAINE,What's been going on out there? I've been standing here 20 minutes.
S03E07,GEORGE,"I'm sorry I'm sorry, here's the test. Thanks again for doing this - hhe."
S03E07,ELAINE,"All right, what time do you want me back here."
S03E07,GEORGE,"Ah, ah, twenty to three."
S03E07,ELAINE,Ok.
S03E07,GEORGE,Thanks again.
S03E07,ELAINE,All right.
S03E07,GEORGE,"A-and don't settle for 145, you can do better, you're a genius. Heheheh (laughs)"
S03E07,JERRY,Thank you Babu. You have quite a flair. You are quite the restaurateur I must say.
S03E07,BABU,It is in deed my pleasure.
S03E07,JERRY,"Oh, please..."
S03E07,BABU,"Oh, welcome to the Dream Cafe. (runs to get a menu.) Our specials today..."
S03E07,ELAINE,"Oh, no no no. I'll just have a tea and toast. (sits down across the table from Jerry)"
S03E07,BABU,Tea and toast.
S03E07,JERRY,Eat something! Babu...
S03E07,ELAINE,"Um, ok, ah well I'll have the, th-ri-rigatoni."
S03E07,BABU,"Oh, oh very good choice. Very good."
S03E07,JERRY,"Oh wow, so you got the test. You're cheating."
S03E07,ELAINE,I know.
S03E07,KRAMER,Hey.
S03E07,JERRY,Hey.
S03E07,KRAMER,Oh boy. Woop...
S03E07,KRAMER,"Jerry let me ask you something, hi Elaine... (pats her on the shoulder twice.)"
S03E07,ELAINE,Hey.
S03E07,KRAMER,"This guy leaves this jacket at my mother's house two years ago. Now, she hasn't spoken to him since and now he says he wants the jacket back."
S03E07,JERRY,So?
S03E07,KRAMER,"Well, I'm not giving it back."
S03E07,JERRY,Why not?
S03E07,KRAMER,"Well because I meet a lot of women in this jacket, you know they're attracted to it. I mean why do you think my mother went out with him?"
S03E07,KRAMER,"Oh, gees..."
S03E07,ELAINE,"Ok,"
S03E07,KRAMER,You're all right
S03E07,ELAINE,"Yeah, ok... (takes the test and moves to another table.)"
S03E07,KRAMER,"(eating some nachos) Anyway, it's been two years. I mean isn't there like statue of limitations on that?"
S03E07,JERRY,Statute.
S03E07,KRAMER,What?
S03E07,JERRY,Statute of limitations. It's not a statue.
S03E07,KRAMER,"No, it's statue."
S03E07,JERRY,"Fine, it's a sculpture of limitations."
S03E07,KRAMER,"Wait a minute, Just wait a minute...Elaine, Elaine! Now you're smart, is it statue or statute of limitations?"
S03E07,ELAINE,Statute.
S03E07,KRAMER,"Oh, I really think you're wrong."
S03E07,ELAINE,"Look, Kramer, I have to take this test ok, I don't have a lot of time."
S03E07,KRAMER,What test?
S03E07,ELAINE,An IQ test.
S03E07,KRAMER,Hmm. Why you takin' an IQ test?
S03E07,ELAINE,It's for George.
S03E07,KRAMER,George?
S03E07,ELAINE,"Yeah, can-look ... can I explain it to you later?"
S03E07,KRAMER,"Yeah, but why are you taking an IQ test for George?"
S03E07,ELAINE,Would you please?!
S03E07,KRAMER,"What, is it for a job or something?"
S03E07,ELAINE,Later!
S03E07,KRAMER,You're positive it's statute?
S03E07,ELAINE,"Yes, yes! (Jerry shaking his head, like he can't believe what he's seeing)"
S03E07,BABU,"Welcome, welcome. A steaming hot face towel for your... (gives Kramer a hot towel and Kramer screams, Elaine screams and Kramer falls from his chair. He gets up and is dazed)"
S03E07,MONICA,George?
S03E07,GEORGE,Yeah?
S03E07,MONICA,The door is locked.
S03E07,GEORGE,"Oh, it's locked?"
S03E07,MONICA,I need to get something.
S03E07,GEORGE,"Monica, I'm really focused here, this stuff's a killer. (turns to the next page)"
S03E07,MONICA,George!
S03E07,GEORGE,Wish I could. (raises the magazine up in front of his face and continues reading.)
S03E07,BABU,"Nananeena, Ladadeeda, laadadeeda, saadina.... Laadadeeda sa saadina (singing too loud)"
S03E07,ELAINE,Babu! Ba-If-if ya don't mind?
S03E07,BABU,Set. ok
S03E07,ELAINE,Set.
S03E07,BABU,I'll get it ...
S03E07,ELAINE,Oh my God! It's all over the test!
S03E07,BABU,"Oh, I did sc-I'm terribly sorry."
S03E07,JERRY,Oh my God.
S03E07,ELAINE,Oh man! Look at this... I'm out of time anyway.
S03E07,BABU,"Please, forgive me, please..."
S03E07,JERRY,"Go ahead, I'll take care of it."
S03E07,ELAINE,Uhh.
S03E07,BABU,"(opens the door for Elaine) Please, I'm very sorry. Tell your friends!"
S03E07,JERRY,"It's all right, she was cheating anyway."
S03E07,BABU,You're a very kind man.
S03E07,JERRY,"Babu, you're Pakistani, right?"
S03E07,BABU,"Yes, Pakistani, yes."
S03E07,JERRY,"Babu, may I say something?"
S03E07,BABU,"Of course, you're very smart man, I listen."
S03E07,JERRY,"I am not a restaurateur by any means, but it occurred to me that perhaps you might serve some dishes from your native Pakistan? As opposed to say t-the franks and beans for example."
S03E07,BABU,But there are no Pakistani people here.
S03E07,JERRY,Doesn't matter. You would have the only authentic Pakistani restaurant in the whole neighborhood.
S03E07,BABU,"Yes, you see everything, don't you?"
S03E07,JERRY,"Well, you know; not everything. I do what I can."
S03E07,BABU,"I close down today and when I open again it'll be all Pakistani restaurant. Thank you, thank you so much, you're very special person, very special."
S03E07,ELAINE,It was an accident.
S03E07,GEORGE,What did you go on a picnic?
S03E07,ELAINE,Babu Bhatt did it.
S03E07,GEORGE,Babu Bhatt? How I'm going to explain this?
S03E07,MONICA,Time's up George.
S03E07,GEORGE,U-ok. (George closes the window and shoos Elaine off. He opens the door to Monica.) Here you go.
S03E07,MONICA,How did you do?
S03E07,GEORGE,Piece of cake; hu.
S03E07,MONICA,What happened to the test?
S03E07,GEORGE,What? Oh I spilled some food on it.
S03E07,MONICA,Food? What food?
S03E07,GEORGE,What are you talking about?
S03E07,MONICA,Where did you get food?
S03E07,GEORGE,From my pocket.
S03E07,MONICA,Your pocket?
S03E07,GEORGE,"I eh, I had a sandwich in my pocket."
S03E07,MONICA,And coffee?
S03E07,GEORGE,"Yeah, had some coffee, yeah."
S03E07,MONICA,Where did you get the coffee?
S03E07,GEORGE,"Where did I get the coffee? Where do think I got the coffee, at the grocery store. (small laugh)"
S03E07,MONICA,How did you get there?
S03E07,GEORGE,I walked.
S03E07,MONICA,How did you get out of the apartment? I didn't see you leave.
S03E07,GEORGE,I climbed out the window.
S03E07,MONICA,You climbed out the window?
S03E07,GEORGE,Of course.
S03E07,MONICA,Why didn't you go out the door?
S03E07,GEORGE,The door? Why would I go out the door? The window's right here.
S03E07,MONICA,"You're a fascinating man, George Costanza."
S03E07,"[Jerry's apartment, Jerry and Elaine. Jerry is looking Dream cafe with binoculars. There's a sign on the window",Closed for renovation.]
S03E07,JERRY,"The average person in a situation like this, they walk right by it. Not me."
S03E07,ELAINE,You're very special.
S03E07,KRAMER,"Hey, do me a favor... Some guy comes in looking for me, tell him you don't know where I am."
S03E07,JERRY,"Of course, I always do."
S03E07,KRAMER,"No, no it's that guy. He's really been bugging me about the jacket."
S03E07,ELAINE,Just give it back to him.
S03E07,KRAMER,"Oh, he'll have to kill me. (leaves.)"
S03E07,JERRY,Hey Georgie!
S03E07,GEORGE,Coming up.
S03E07,JERRY,How'd you do on the IQ test?!
S03E07,GEORGE,85!
S03E07,JERRY,What?!!
S03E07,GEORGE,"85, Jerry! 85 IQ !"
S03E07,ELAINE,85?
S03E07,JERRY,"Well, well, well..."
S03E07,ELAINE,He's coming up?
S03E07,JERRY,"Well, I'm no genius but, according to my calculations he should be here in a few seconds."
S03E07,ELAINE,"Yeah, but an 85, Jerry, that's ridiculous."
S03E07,JERRY,"Well, maybe the test was gender bias, you know a lot of questions on hunting and testicles..."
S03E07,GEORGE,"Oh, hello Professor."
S03E07,ELAINE,"George, I cannot believe..."
S03E07,GEORGE,Please...
S03E07,ELAINE,No there has got be a mistake.
S03E07,GEORGE,You should've seen her face. It was the exact same look my father gave me when I told him I wanted to be a ventriloquist.
S03E07,JERRY,But an 85?
S03E07,ELAINE,"Listen, there were too many distractions there. Babu...what ever he's name was and Kramer...I couldn't concentrate."

S03E07,ELAINE,"Well Kramer, I have to return this test. I've got to get out of here."
S03E07,KRAMER,I thought you took the test.

S03E07,JERRY,"You know, what would be great?"
S03E08,JERRY,"....hair that was on your shower soap today could be in your head tomorrow. How did they do the first transplant? Did they have the guy take a shower , get his soap , rush it in there by helicopter, you know keep the soap alive on the soap support system ....looks it over. ""We got the hair but I think we lost the Zest."" ....rejects the transplant with organs. Is it possible that a head could reject the hair transplant . Guy just standin' there and suddenly... ..Bink! ( motions hair flying out of his head)........lands in someone's frozen yogurt."
S03E08,REPAIRMAN,.....The gaskets that you have here are asymmetrical.

S03E08,JERRY,Oh! well whatever you have to do.
S03E08,REPAIRMAN,I was working with one.....mount at a time 'cos you don't wanna disturb the position of the compressor.
S03E08,JERRY,(sarcastically) No you don't..
S03E08,GEORGE,Hey! what are listening to?
S03E08,JERRY,My show from last night.
S03E08,GEORGE,Oh! you taped it?
S03E08,JERRY,"Yeah , I was doing new material."
S03E08,GEORGE,Hey! Did 'ya ever do that thing on the toes that I said .
S03E08,JERRY,Huh?
S03E08,GEORGE,"Yeah! like the big toe is like the captain of the toes, but sometimes the toe next to the big toe gets so big that there's like a power struggle and the second toe assumes control of the foot."
S03E08,JERRY,"The"" coup d-toe"""
S03E08,GEORGE,Yeah. Did you do it?
S03E08,JERRY,Yeah!
S03E08,GEORGE,So?
S03E08,JERRY,Nothin'.....nothing at all.
S03E08,GEORGE,Need to use the phone.
S03E08,JERRY,Who you calling?

S03E08,REPAIRMAN,Did you see that last night?
S03E08,GEORGE,It was on CNN ( Kramer comes in and he is taping from a Camcorder) This Chinese doctor Zeng Zau. has discovered a cure for baldness.
S03E08,JERRY,(to Kramer) What's this?
S03E08,KRAMER,"Well I just got it. Spector gave it to me , he's giving everything away...becoming a minimalist."
S03E08,GEORGE,Is that the guy who likes fat women?
S03E08,JERRY,Doesn't the fat fetish conflict with the minimalism.
S03E08,KRAMER,"(to George) You , you know what you should've done is watching that report on CNN last night."
S03E08,GEORGE,"I did, I'm trying to call China."
S03E08,KRAMER,"You can't call China now its like, what, three 'O clock in the morning there"
S03E08,JERRY,Oh! my God!....
S03E08,GEORGE,What?
S03E08,JERRY,Oh! God.. Oh! man.....Oh! brother!!! I can't believe what I'm hearing. This woman his talking to me on my tape recorder while I was on stage. This is wild. I've never heard anything like this in my life. Listen to this.

S03E08,GEORGE,"WAIT ,WAIT, WAIT, WAIT!!!!.... Where was the tape recorder?"
S03E08,JERRY,"It was in the back of the room on the left, she must have been sitting right in front of it."
S03E08,GEORGE,My god!!!
S03E08,KRAMER,C'mon it's my turn.
S03E08,GEORGE,"All right, All right, all, right!!( gives the headphones to Kramer) How you gonna find out who this is?"
S03E08,JERRY,Good question.
S03E08,KRAMER,"Where's the volume..(finds it) A, YAI..YA...YA..YA!!!!"
S03E08,GEORGE,What do the Chinese have to gain by faking a cure for baldness?
S03E08,JERRY,"If it was real ,they would never let it out of the country. No baldness , it'd be like a nation of Supermen."
S03E08,ELAINE,Hi boys.
S03E08,BOTH,Hello...

S03E08,JERRY,Hey! Is that Peter? ...I can't believe it. Get me a cup of Decaf. (leaves table)
S03E08,ELAINE,So did you hear this message?

S03E08,ELAINE,"Oh! That was nothing. So listen, what about this bald thing?"
S03E08,GEORGE,"Ah! Some bald thing, a bald thing I dunno. It's nothing"
S03E08,JERRY,Remember Peter?

S03E08,ELAINE,"So listen , what about this girl on the tape recorder?"
S03E08,JERRY,Oh Elaine....What do you think an enraptured female fan of mine might say?
S03E08,ELAINE,I don't know.
S03E08,JERRY,"She went on in some detail about certain activities, illegal in some states, for consenting adults. Things you would know very little about."
S03E08,ELAINE,Oh! really.

S03E08,GEORGE,Oh! my god. Oh! man...
S03E08,JERRY,I don't get it. Why would a woman do that and then leave no way to get in touch with her.
S03E08,ELAINE,(coming out of the shower in a bathrobe) May be she realized she could never have you and she jumped off the George Washington Bridge.
S03E08,GEORGE,"(phone rings ,picks up) Operator? Beijing?"
S03E08,JERRY,Why are you doing this?
S03E08,GEORGE,Why do I do anything? tsss...For women.

S03E08,GEORGE,Really? ..You think.
S03E08,JERRY,"Kramer. I would like to talk to George for a minute, please."
S03E08,KRAMER,'bout what?
S03E08,JERRY,It's kinda private.
S03E08,KRAMER,Like the big toe captain..
S03E08,GEORGE,So now you're doing my bits?
S03E08,JERRY,I'M NOT DOING YOUR BITS!!
S03E08,KRAMER,"Okay , all right. I'm gonna take a look at this huh!.( leaves)"
S03E08,JERRY,Does she know?
S03E08,GEORGE,NO!!
S03E08,JERRY,How did it happen?
S03E08,GEORGE,I can't say.
S03E08,JERRY,"Well, why can't you say it?"
S03E08,GEORGE,Because I promised her.
S03E08,JERRY,I thought you just said she doesn't know??
S03E08,GEORGE,She doesn't.
S03E08,JERRY,So how can you promise her?
S03E08,GEORGE,Because she asked me to.
S03E08,JERRY,"What is this, an Abbott and Costello routine?"
S03E08,GEORGE,All right You really want to know?...It all started when she told met hat...she was the voice on your tape recorder.
S03E08,JERRY,"What, Elaine?"
S03E08,GEORGE,Yeah! She made me promise not to tell you .It's supposed to be a joke.
S03E08,JERRY,(picks up the headphones) That was Elaine...
S03E08,GEORGE,Well let me hear....( they struggle for the headphones)
S03E08,JERRY,Wait a second. .Just give me a second
S03E08,GEORGE,You heard it fifty times already.
S03E08,JERRY,She's my ex-girlfriend I think I have precedence
S03E08,JERRY,Yeaaaah!!!
S03E08,ELAINE,"Hi, It's Elaine is this a bad time?"
S03E08,GEORGE,"(Yelling from the bathroom) Don't tell her anything, she'll kill me!!"
S03E08,JERRY,"Okay, Okay, I promise. (puts on the headphones again) Wow!!! Oh Man...Oh God.. Oh Brother....Whoooaaaa!! Whoaaaa (Elaine enters he takes them off rapidly)"
S03E08,ELAINE,(Concerned) What's the matter?
S03E08,JERRY,Oooh! I got a pain in my side.
S03E08,ELAINE,"(to George returning) Hi George. Something stinks in here.( George motions to Jerry, she nods)"
S03E08,JERRY,What are you doing here?
S03E08,ELAINE,I was the one who talked into your tape recorder.
S03E08,JERRY,"I know, George told me."
S03E08,ELAINE,You told him!!!!
S03E08,GEORGE,He..He threatened me.
S03E08,JERRY,Where did you come up with all that stuff?
S03E08,ELAINE,That was nothing.
S03E08,GEORGE,Elaine.. I have to tell you something...
S03E08,JERRY,George NO!!
S03E08,GEORGE,No no no no no no no..
S03E08,JERRY,George I'm telling ya..
S03E08,ELAINE,What is it?
S03E08,GEORGE,I'm very attracted to you..
S03E08,JERRY,Aye......
S03E08,KRAMER,"I'VE FOUND A HAIR!!! Yes ( goes up to the video machine and inserts the tape) Hey, come here, come here ,take a look at this."
S03E08,GEORGE,Ever since I found out that you let that message on Jerry's tape recorder I...
S03E08,KRAMER,Whoa!!!....That was you?
S03E08,ELAINE,It was a joke...
S03E08,KRAMER,"Wait..( picks up the walkman) Oh my god...Oh yeah....Elaine , I can't believe that that is you."
S03E08,ELAINE,"Aah.... ( she stares at the three of them all lined up like the Daltons, all looking at her with lust.) I think I'll get going..."
S03E08,GEORGE,Heuh. huh. Stick around a while.
S03E08,JERRY,It's early.
S03E08,KRAMER,We'll order Chinese.
S03E09,GEORGE,Where'd you meet her?
S03E09,JERRY,I met her on an elevator.
S03E09,GEORGE,On an elevator? You met a woman on an elevator?
S03E09,JERRY,"Impossible, right?"
S03E09,GEORGE,You got less than sixty seconds. That's like dismantling a time bomb. What got into you?
S03E09,JERRY,"I don't know. She was so beautiful, it was like a pure reflex. The words just came out of my mouth."
S03E09,GEORGE,Wow. What'd you say?
S03E09,JERRY,"You know, I'm the one responsible for those crop circles in England."
S03E09,GEORGE,Wow.
S03E09,JERRY,Can you believe I did that?
S03E09,GEORGE,What did she say?
S03E09,ISABEL,What crop circles?
S03E09,JERRY,Not a good sign.
S03E09,GEORGE,Not everybody knows what the crop circles are. (to the newsstand owner) Do you know what the crop circles are?
S03E09,NEWSSTAND OWNER,Crop circles? Why don't you buy something?
S03E09,JERRY,You got something in your teeth there.
S03E09,GEORGE,What?
S03E09,JERRY,It's green.
S03E09,GEORGE,"Oh, man, it's spinach! I've been walking around like this all afternoon."
S03E09,JERRY,Did you bump into anybody you knew?
S03E09,GEORGE,I had a job interview.
S03E09,JERRY,How'd it go?
S03E09,GEORGE,Take a guess.
S03E09,INTERVIEWER,"Well, Mr. Costanza, we have nothing available at the present time, but should anything open up, we'll be in touch."
S03E09,GEORGE,"Ok, thanks."
S03E09,JERRY,"What do you need a job, you got Audrey."
S03E09,GEORGE,"Yeah, right."
S03E09,JERRY,What's the matter?
S03E09,GEORGE,"Oh, nothing."
S03E09,JERRY,What?
S03E09,GEORGE,You won't think I'm a bad person?
S03E09,JERRY,Too late for that.
S03E09,GEORGE,"'Cause believe me, I would only say this to you and maybe a psychiatrist, maybe. Well, her nose is a little big."
S03E09,JERRY,"Yeah, she's got a big nose."
S03E09,GEORGE,"I mean, big would even be ok, a little beyond big."
S03E09,JERRY,It's a schnoz.
S03E09,GEORGE,"Now, I'm aware that my own physical dimensions are perhaps a little short of perfection."
S03E09,JERRY,A little.
S03E09,GEORGE,"So who am I to be thinking about someone's nose? I mean, I should be grateful someone like her even looks at me. I have no job, nothing. But I have to say, I think about the nose. I don't want to think about the nose. I don't ask to think about the nose, but I think about it. I go to bed at night, I tell myself, 'Don't think about the nose, forget the nose,' but I think about it. I look at her, I see nose."
S03E09,JERRY,Stop being so concerned with looks.
S03E09,JERRY,Have you said anything to her about it?
S03E09,GEORGE,"I could never do that. You know the ironic thing is if she had a smaller nose, I never could have gone out with her in the first place. She'd be out of my league with a smaller nose. And I really like her, I know that. And I know one other thing. I'm not getting past that nose."
S03E09,JERRY,"Alright, shut up, here they come."
S03E09,GEORGE,(waving) How can I not think about it? Look at the size of this thing.
S03E09,KRAMER,"So my mother's going out with this guy who leaves a jacket in her house so, you know, she gives it to me. Well, two years later he shows up and he takes it back. And now he's in prison. He got arrested for mail fraud. So Elaine, all you have to do is go over to the apartment, tell the landlord that you're his daughter and you want to bring him the jacket in prison."
S03E09,ELAINE,Won't the landlord know I'm not the daughter?
S03E09,KRAMER,"No no, he's never met her. She's in California."
S03E09,ELAINE,Are you coming with me?
S03E09,KRAMER,"Oh, yeah yeah, I have to. I'm your fianc, Peter Von Nostrand."
S03E09,GEORGE,Why don't you just commit yourself already?
S03E09,AUDREY,What is so special about this jacket?
S03E09,ELAINE,He believes it possesses some extraordinary power over women.
S03E09,AUDREY,What's the smudge on your hand?
S03E09,KRAMER,"Oh, I got stamped at the reggae lounge last night. Yeah, I'm going back there tonight, you know, I'm not gonna pay another cover charge."
S03E09,GEORGE,"What, you didn't wash all day?"
S03E09,KRAMER,"Yeah, I washed, just not the hand. You wouldn't believe the women at this club. Ohh, man."
S03E09,AUDREY,It's amazing how many beautiful women live in New York. I actually find it kind of intimidating.
S03E09,KRAMER,"Well, you're as pretty as any of them, you just need a nose job."
S03E09,ELAINE,Kramer!
S03E09,KRAMER,What? What?
S03E09,ELAINE,How could you say something like that?!
S03E09,KRAMER,What? What do you mean? I just said she needs a nose job.
S03E09,ELAINE,"No no, there's nothing wrong with her nose! I'm so sorry, Audrey."
S03E09,AUDREY,"No, it's ok."
S03E09,ELAINE,What did you have to say that for?
S03E09,KRAMER,"Well, I was just trying to help out."
S03E09,ELAINE,"Yeah? Well, you can kiss that jacket goodbye, Mr. Von Nozzin."
S03E09,KRAMER,You see what happens when you try to be nice?
S03E09,AUDREY,Elaine said I could stay with her another month until Tina gets back. What are you thinking about?
S03E09,GEORGE,Thinking? Nothing. What could I possibly be thinking?
S03E09,AUDREY,You look like you've got something on your mind.
S03E09,GEORGE,"Oh, yeah, right. I wish I had something on my mind. (pregnant pause) So how about that Kramer, huh?"
S03E09,AUDREY,How about him?
S03E09,GEORGE,They way he just says stuff.
S03E09,AUDREY,He sure does.
S03E09,GEORGE,"Yeah. Yeah, he's quite a character."
S03E09,AUDREY,"So, what did you think?"
S03E09,GEORGE,About the pizza?
S03E09,AUDREY,"No, about the nose job."
S03E09,GEORGE,"Oh, the nose job. I don't know, what did you think?"
S03E09,AUDREY,"Well, I've thought about it, but I don't know."
S03E09,GEORGE,"Yeah. (another pause) Not that I care, one way or the other, but these doctors today really do amazing things, you know, if you were so inclined. And again, I'm not suggesting."
S03E09,AUDREY,"I know, they're good."
S03E09,GEORGE,Peter Jennings had one.
S03E09,AUDREY,Really?
S03E09,GEORGE,"Probably. They all do. In my high school, half my graduating class had them. Of course, I'm from Long Island, so..."
S03E09,AUDREY,Uh huh.
S03E09,GEORGE,"It's really nothing, it's like going to the dentist."
S03E09,AUDREY,I hate the dentist.
S03E09,GEORGE,It's a cleaning.
S03E09,AUDREY,So you really think I should do this?
S03E09,GEORGE,"If it makes you happy, I don't focus on these things. I will tell you this Unfortunately, we live in a very superficial society. I don't condone it, but it's a fact of life."
S03E09,AUDREY,"Well, maybe I should."
S03E09,GEORGE,What the hell.
S03E09,ELAINE,"(barging in) Aw, now you talked her into getting a nose job?"
S03E09,GEORGE,Me? I didn't say anything.
S03E09,ELAINE,You encouraged her to get one.
S03E09,GEORGE,I didn't encourage. No encourage.
S03E09,ELAINE,Peter Jennings had one?
S03E09,GEORGE,It's possible.
S03E09,ELAINE,"Well, I think you should accept her for who she is."
S03E09,AUDREY,"No, George is right. I want to get one."
S03E09,ELAINE,I think it's a mistake.
S03E09,GEORGE,"Me too, really. Unless you'd really like to get one."
S03E09,GEORGE,"I'm going straight to hell, no two ways about it."
S03E09,JERRY,"Well, it might not be hell but you're gonna run into some bad dudes."
S03E09,GEORGE,"(checking his watch) Hey, let's get the check, she's taking the bandages off at four o'clock."
S03E09,JERRY,We have time.
S03E09,GEORGE,"It's exciting, isn't it? She's gonna have a whole new face."
S03E09,JERRY,It is exciting.
S03E09,GEORGE,"Of course, not as exciting as miss crop circles, but..."
S03E09,JERRY,"Please, please, Isabel? She is the most despicable woman I have ever met in my life. I have never been so repulsed by someone mentally and so attracted to them physically at the same time. It's like my brain is facing my penis in a chess game. And I'm letting him win."
S03E09,GEORGE,You're not letting him win. He wins till you're forty.
S03E09,JERRY,Then what?
S03E09,GEORGE,He still wins but it's not a blowout.
S03E09,JERRY,"She wants to be an actress. She makes me read these moronic acting scenes with her, and I do it because I'm so addicted to the sex, I'm helpless, I'll do anything. So finally Kramer comes in the other day."
S03E09,JERRY,"(holding up a piece of paper) I don't want to see this woman anymore but I haven't got the will power to throw out her number. Please, help me. Help me."
S03E09,KRAMER,(taking the paper and tearing it to pieces) I'm proud of you.
S03E09,JERRY,"So I'm never gonna see her again, I'm going cold turkey."
S03E09,GEORGE,Good for you.
S03E09,JERRY,"I'll tell you, the sex... I mean, I was like an animal. I mean it was just completely uninhibited."
S03E09,GEORGE,It's like going to the bathroom in front of a lot of people and not caring.
S03E09,JERRY,It's not like that at all.
S03E09,ELAINE,How do you even know the jacket is there?
S03E09,KRAMER,"Well I don't, I'm guessing."
S03E09,GEORGE,"Okay, look, Audrey, before you take the bandage off just remember that I was the one that encouraged you to do this, you know? Now that you're gonna be a great beauty, let's not forget how this all began. You know, like if you'd listened to your friend, Elaine,"
S03E09,AUDREY,George?
S03E09,GEORGE,Yeah?
S03E09,AUDREY,Enough.
S03E09,JERRY,"Alright, are we ready? Come on, let's get this show on the road."
S03E09,ELAINE,Are you sure you want us here for this?
S03E09,AUDREY,Yes.
S03E09,JERRY,Shouldn't a doctor do it?
S03E09,AUDREY,"No, he said I could do it. Okay, here goes."
S03E09,GEORGE,"Very exciting, very exciting, it's like watching a birth."
S03E09,ELAINE,It looks good.
S03E09,JERRY,Great job.
S03E09,KRAMER,You got butchered.
S03E09,JERRY,Let's put him over here.
S03E09,KRAMER,(to a fleeing Audrey) Where are you going?
S03E09,AUDREY,(with hand covering nose) To the doctor!
S03E09,KRAMER,"Wait, wait, wait, I'll go with you."
S03E09,ELAINE,How ya feeling?
S03E09,GEORGE,Too much salt in my diet.
S03E09,ELAINE,Can I get you anything?
S03E09,GEORGE,"Nah, I'm good."
S03E09,ELAINE,You sure? Anything?
S03E09,GEORGE,"Mmm, no. Boy, it really didn't come out too well, did it?"
S03E09,ELAINE,"No, it didn't. No, it didn't."
S03E09,GEORGE,"It's like, all dented."
S03E09,ELAINE,Seems to be.
S03E09,GEORGE,"Well, I'm sure they'll be able to fix it. You can't stop modern science. Can't stop it, you can't stop it. Can't stop science. Can't be stopped, no way, no how, science just marches--"
S03E09,ELAINE,"Shut up, George."
S03E09,GEORGE,Shut up?
S03E09,ELAINE,Yeah.
S03E09,GEORGE,Interesting.
S03E09,JERRY,"Come on, Kramer, seriously, give me her number!"
S03E09,KRAMER,"I don't have it, I threw it out."
S03E09,JERRY,"You're lying! You got it, I want that number!"
S03E09,KRAMER,"I told you, I threw it out."
S03E09,JERRY,Give it to me!
S03E09,KRAMER,"You told me not to give it to you, you made me promise."
S03E09,JERRY,"Well, I changed my mind, I want that number."
S03E09,KRAMER,"You said, no matter what you do or say, I'm not to give you the number."
S03E09,JERRY,"I was lying, give it to me!"
S03E09,KRAMER,"No, you told me not to!"
S03E09,JERRY,I want that number!
S03E09,KRAMER,"Alright! (flinging pieces of torn paper to the ground) Yeah! Yeah! Yeah! (Jerry falls to the floor and starts arranging pieces) Look at you! Look at what you've sunk to! Look at what you've become! Look in the mirror, cause you need help, Jerry. You need help, because I can't stand by and do it anymore. It's turning my stomach! I can't stand around here watching you destroy yourself. It's eating me up inside!"
S03E09,AUDREY,The doctor said that they need to build the lateral wall of the septum. Over here...
S03E09,GEORGE,Yeah.
S03E09,AUDREY,You see this perinasal sinus cavity?
S03E09,GEORGE,"Oh, I got it."
S03E09,AUDREY,You see how it's collapsing? That's what's causing this huge dent.
S03E09,GEORGE,"Yeah, phew."
S03E09,AUDREY,"So anyway, George, do you know what I was thinking about?"
S03E09,GEORGE,What?
S03E09,AUDREY,Remember we talked about taking a trip together?
S03E09,GEORGE,We did?
S03E09,AUDREY,"Yeah, we talked about going to Hawaii?"
S03E09,GEORGE,Hawaii?
S03E09,AUDREY,"Anyway, I think it would be great to get away after all this."
S03E09,GEORGE,"(removing his glasses) You know, Hawaii could be a little tricky right now, there's a lot of high pressure winds down there this time of year, there's a lot of debris constantly flying around. Wood, and uh, lava, pretty dangerous."
S03E09,AUDREY,I never heard that.
S03E09,GEORGE,Oh yeah. My friend lived there.
S03E09,AUDREY,We could go to the Caribbean.
S03E09,GEORGE,"You know, I have to tell you something. You couldn't get me on a plane right now. I get those FAA reports directly. My uncle sends them to me, he used to be a pilot, so. Big investigation in the, uh, what's the word there, uh, offing. It's in the offing. But, you know, you shouldn't let that stop you from going. You could go. I don't mind."
S03E09,AUDREY,"George, I don't think this is working."
S03E09,ISABEL,"Ever since you came back from the Army, you've changed. I swear Nelson, I don't even know who you are anymore."
S03E09,JERRY,I'm Nelson!
S03E09,ISABEL,"That's not the line, Jerry."
S03E09,JERRY,"Alright, alright, I'm sorry. (reading) Nothing's changed, Alma, I just need more time."
S03E09,ISABEL,"I swear, Nelson, sometimes at night, when you're not around, I just go crazy thinking about you."
S03E09,JERRY,"Well, you just need to relax. Maybe a hobby, bowling is fun."
S03E09,ISABEL,"Yeah, bowling's good if you're really gross and ugly."
S03E09,JERRY,(to himself Uh oh. My organs are playing chess again.
S03E09,JERRY'S BRAIN,Well I'm getting a little tired of this. What do you say we play one for all the marbles?
S03E09,JERRY'S PENIS,"Oh Brain, what are you doing? You cannot beat me. Do you have any idea who you're dealing with? Forget about it!"
S03E09,JERRY'S BRAIN,I can't take her anymore. I hate reading her stupid little acting scenes.
S03E09,JERRY'S PENIS,"Oh, so what? So you read from a little play. You can't put up with that for an hour to make me happy? You're so selfish. Give me one hour, then I will take over, you will not have to think for the rest of the night."
S03E09,JERRY'S BRAIN,"What about tomorrow morning? Do you have any idea what that's like for me? Do you care? No, you don't care. So long as you get to do whatever it is you do. You disgust me."
S03E09,JERRY'S PENIS,"Oh, go read a book."
S03E09,JERRY'S BRAIN,"Enough chatting, let's play."
S03E09,ELAINE,You know the only reason I'm doing this is because you took Audrey to the hospital.
S03E09,KRAMER,"(filling a pipe) Yeah, yeah, ok, now uh, you're clear, you got everything?"
S03E09,ELAINE,Yeah.
S03E09,KRAMER,Wait wait wait wait wait. (putting a ring on Elaine's finger) Here.
S03E09,ELAINE,What do I need this for?
S03E09,KRAMER,Because we're engaged.
S03E09,ELAINE,We're engaged?
S03E09,KRAMER,Um hm.
S03E09,ELAINE,"Kramer, this is too big."
S03E09,KRAMER,(lighting his pipe) It's my mom's.
S03E09,LANDLORD,Hello?
S03E09,ELAINE,"Oh, uh, hi. I'm Wanda Pepper, I'm Albert Pepper's daughter. My father asked me to come here and pick up his jacket for him."
S03E09,LANDLORD,"Oh, hello Miss Pepper, it's a pleasure to meet you. (To Kramer) And you must be Professor Von Nostrand?"
S03E09,KRAMER,"Yes, yes I am."
S03E09,LANDLORD,"I've read your book, Professor, and I was quite intrigued by it."
S03E09,KRAMER,"Uh, yes. Well, it's, uh, very intriguing."
S03E09,LANDLORD,"Tell me, is it your contention that Shakespeare was an imposter?"
S03E09,KRAMER,My contention?
S03E09,LANDLORD,"Yes, your contention."
S03E09,KRAMER,"Yes, that's my contention."
S03E09,ELAINE,I heard him contend that.
S03E09,LANDLORD,It's too bad about your father.
S03E09,ELAINE,"Oh, it was a frame-up."
S03E09,LANDLORD,"A fine man, he spoke often of you. He's very proud of the work you're doing."
S03E09,ELAINE,"Oh, well, we're all proud of the work I'm doing."
S03E09,KRAMER,She does fine work.
S03E09,LANDLORD,"Your father gave me strict orders not to turn the jacket over to anyone, but I suppose I can make an exception in your case. The closet's this way."
S03E09,ELAINE,How kind of you.
S03E09,LANDLORD,"You know, your father has a very extensive wardrobe."
S03E09,JERRY'S BRAIN,"What's the matter, fella? You look a little tired. Ha ha ha ha ha!"
S03E09,ISABEL,"Nelson, don't you see? You are a part of me, and I, I am a part of you."
S03E09,JERRY'S PENIS,It's killing me. (Makes a move)
S03E09,JERRY'S BRAIN,That's your move?
S03E09,JERRY'S PENIS,Yeah.
S03E09,JERRY'S BRAIN,"Well that's trouble, my friend. That's big trouble. Checkmate!"
S03E09,JERRY'S PENIS,(beginning to cough and struggle) Getting weak... Losing power... You haven't seen the last of me. I'll be back. You're nothing without me. Nothing!
S03E09,JERRY'S BRAIN,(before disappearing himself) Punk.
S03E09,JERRY,"Isabel, uh, I don't think this is working."
S03E09,ELAINE,Daddy certainly does have an extensive wardrobe.
S03E09,LANDLORD,He is a fine dresser and I'm sure I don't have to tell you he's quite popular with the ladies.
S03E09,ELAINE,"My father, really? I had no idea."
S03E09,LANDLORD,"Yes, they're crazy about him. There was one in particular, came around about two years ago, looked a lot like you, Professor. Could have been your mother. What was her name again? Carter? Kramer! That's it, Babs"
S03E09,KRAMER,You don't say?
S03E09,ELAINE,I found it!
S03E09,LANDLORD,"The woman used to walk around here half naked, sucking Colt 45 from a can. Her big fat stomach hanging out, orthopedic hose up to her knees, screaming down the hall, ""Come back to bed, Albert, you big hairy ape, and bring back that box of Danish!"""
S03E09,KRAMER,So I grabbed the guy by the collar.
S03E09,ELAINE,"Yeah, and I yelled out, Kramer! Kramer, you're killing him!"""
S03E09,JERRY,So I assume the jig was up.
S03E09,ELAINE,"Yeah, pretty much."
S03E09,AUDREY,Hi.
S03E09,ELAINE,Hi!
S03E09,JERRY,Hey.
S03E09,AUDREY,(to George) Hello.
S03E09,GEORGE,"(smitten) Audrey? My god, you look incredible! I can't believe it!"
S03E09,AUDREY,"(motioning to Kramer) Well, it was his doctor. He was wonderful."
S03E09,ELAINE,"So, will I see you later tonight?"
S03E09,AUDREY,Not sure.
S03E09,KRAMER,"(rising and putting his arm around Audrey's shoulder) Well, I'll check you guys out later. (To Audrey) Ready?"
S03E09,AUDREY,(holding up her hand to show the stamp) I didn't wash.
S03E09,KRAMER,Neither did I. We're off to the Reggae Lounge.
S03E09,ELAINE,(after they leave) Isn't she beautiful? Her nose is in such perfect proportion with the rest of her face. She's breathtaking! Who would have though she's like--
S03E09,GEORGE,(interrupting) Elaine. Shut up.
S03E10,JERRY,How did you get fleas?
S03E10,GEORGE,Because my cousin's imbecile dog was rolling around outside and they got in his carpet.
S03E10,JERRY,Maybe you can get yourself a little bowtie flea collar.
S03E10,GEORGE,"That's not funny. So, are you coming to the party?"
S03E10,JERRY,"I'd go, but Long Island, it's so far out, it smacks of desperation. The whole party, everyone's gonna be saying to me, ""You came all the way out from Manhattan for this?"""
S03E10,GEORGE,You know Ava's gonna be there.
S03E10,JERRY,Who?
S03E10,GEORGE,The nice one that works in my office.
S03E10,JERRY,Nah.
S03E10,GEORGE,I'll drive.
S03E10,JERRY,"Oh, well, now you're talking."
S03E10,GEORGE,It's supposed to be a good party.
S03E10,JERRY,"What does that mean, good dip?"
S03E10,GEORGE,"No, there'll be girls there."
S03E10,JERRY,"There's girls everywhere. I go out of my apartment, there's girls in the elevator. They're in cafeterias, subways, so what?"
S03E10,GEORGE,There's a hundred different things here. What's the difference between these two? (They each grab a box and check the ingredients) You got propylparabin?
S03E10,JERRY,Got it.
S03E10,GEORGE,You got isobutane-30?
S03E10,JERRY,I got isobutane-20.
S03E10,GEORGE,A-ha.
S03E10,JERRY,You got sorbitant sesquioliate?
S03E10,GEORGE,Got it.
S03E10,JERRY,I have aloe!
S03E10,GEORGE,You got aloe? I love aloe.
S03E10,JERRY,Where do they make yours?
S03E10,GEORGE,Jersey.
S03E10,JERRY,White Plains.
S03E10,JERRY,"Girls. There's girls right here in the store. Look, look, there's one over there. Look, there's another one. Soon as I walk outside there'll be girls out there. What's the matter?"
S03E10,GEORGE,"I gave her a twenty, she only gave me change for a ten."
S03E10,JERRY,"Are you sure? Oh boy, here we go."
S03E10,GEORGE,"(to the cashier) Excuse me, I gave you a twenty dollar bill and you only actually gave me change for a ten."
S03E10,CASHIER,You gave me a ten.
S03E10,GEORGE,I'm positive I gave you a twenty.
S03E10,CASHIER,I know what you gave me.
S03E10,GEORGE,You owe me ten dollars.
S03E10,CASHIER,Will you please step aside? Next?
S03E10,GEORGE,"Alright, let's just examine the situation for a second. Who, in this situation, would be more likely to make a mistake? Me, who had access to my wallet, knew exactly what was in there? Or you--"
S03E10,CASHIER,You.
S03E10,GEORGE,"No, no, no, see you're not really listening."
S03E10,SECURITY GUARD,What's the problem here?
S03E10,GEORGE,"No problem. There's no problem. She just owes me ten dollars, that's all."
S03E10,CASHIER,He's claiming short.
S03E10,SECURITY GUARD,"Alright, let's just take it outside."
S03E10,GEORGE,"Oh, so you don't believe me either?"
S03E10,SECURITY GUARD,"Come on, let's go."
S03E10,GEORGE,"You haven't won. You may think you've won, but you haven't won. Do you know why? It's not over. This is not over. I'm not forgetting what's happening here. You have my ten dollars. I will get it back. Alright, don't worry. It's not over. I'm going now. Good bye. I will be back."
S03E10,ELAINE,"Well don't stand here, let's walk in, blend in, blend in."
S03E10,JERRY,"No, let's survey first. Camp here."
S03E10,GEORGE,(waving Eva.
S03E10,JERRY,"What could possess anyone to throw a party? I mean, to have a bunch of strangers treat your house like a hotel room."
S03E10,AVA,"So, guess who just sold 129 West 81st."
S03E10,GEORGE,"Oh no you didn't. Get out, when?"
S03E10,AVA,Yesterday
S03E10,GEORGE,I don't believe it.
S03E10,AVA,Ask Mark.
S03E10,GEORGE,"Mark, is this true?"
S03E10,JERRY,"Yeah, this has got disaster written all over it."
S03E10,ELAINE,"How did I ever let you talk me into this, I must have been out of my mind."
S03E10,JERRY,"Now listen, let's keep an eye on each other tonight. In case one of us gets in a bad conversation, we should have a signal that you're in trouble so the other one can get us out of it."
S03E10,ELAINE,How old are you?
S03E10,JERRY,"Thirty-six. What's the signal? Howbout this? Chicken wing? No, no, no, I got a better one. Head patting."
S03E10,ELAINE,Whatever you want.
S03E10,GUY,You came all the way out from Manhattan for this?
S03E10,JERRY,"Yeah, yeah I did."
S03E10,GUY,So what do you do?
S03E10,JERRY,(Patting his head I'm a comedian.
S03E10,GUY,Are you? Lemme ask you something. Where do you get your material?
S03E10,JERRY,(still Patting) I hear a voice.
S03E10,GUY,What kind of voice?
S03E10,JERRY,"A man's voice, but he speaks in German so I have to get a translator."
S03E10,GUY,How come you keep tapping your head.
S03E10,JERRY,It's a nervous tic. I'm on L-Dopa.
S03E10,GUY,"On the other hand, you take a guy like George Washington Carver. The man devoted his whole life to the peanut. Imagine having so much passion for something."
S03E10,GUY,"Ya know, people tell me I'm a funny guy."
S03E10,GUY,I've often wondered if he ever worked with the pecan.
S03E10,ELAINE,"Yeah, me too."
S03E10,GUY,"Now is that considered a nut, because I know the cashew is a legume."
S03E10,GEORGE,How's it going?
S03E10,JERRY,"Great, how about you?"
S03E10,GEORGE,"I can't believe what's happening here. She hasn't taken her hands off me all night. She was always friendly around the office, but that was it."
S03E10,JERRY,How do you account for this?
S03E10,GEORGE,"I don't know, maybe a safe fell on her head."
S03E10,JERRY,"Well, she obviously liked you all along."
S03E10,GEORGE,"No, I would have picked up on it. I can always tell when a woman likes me, they always somehow let you know. With me, they could torture me, I wouldn't tell them. If anything I'd try to make them think I don't like them, then they think, ""Oh, look at this guy, he's not even looking at me, he must have something going for him."""
S03E10,JERRY,"Anyway, I'm ready to go."
S03E10,GEORGE,Now?
S03E10,JERRY,"If not now, when?"
S03E10,GEORGE,Gimme a half-hour.
S03E10,JERRY,"Okay, half-hour."
S03E10,GUY,"Peanut brittle, peanut butter, peanut oil..."
S03E10,JERRY,(interrupting) Can I talk to you for a second?
S03E10,ELAINE,"Oh, excuse me. (gets up to talk with Jerry) What have you been doing, I've been smacking myself senseless. People think I'm a mental patient."
S03E10,JERRY,"Hey, I was dying over there."
S03E10,ELAINE,This guy's going off on the peanut. Now pay attention.
S03E10,ELLEN,"Yeah, I think I've seen you in a club. You talk about a lot of everyday things, right?"
S03E10,JERRY,Right.
S03E10,ELLEN,"Yeah, I remember you."
S03E10,WOMAN,I wonder what happened to my fianc. I know he's here somewhere. Ellen? Have you seen my fianc?
S03E10,ELLEN,He's upstairs.
S03E10,WOMAN,"Are you going upstairs? Tell my fianc I'm looking for him. I havelost my fianc, the poor baby."
S03E10,ELAINE,Maybe the dingo ate your baby.
S03E10,WOMAN,What?
S03E10,ELAINE,The dingo ate your baby!
S03E10,JERRY,You ready?
S03E10,GEORGE,"Listen, I have a tremendous favor to ask."
S03E10,JERRY,I do favors.
S03E10,GEORGE,I think something's happening here.
S03E10,JERRY,What?
S03E10,GEORGE,I think she wants me to take her home.
S03E10,JERRY,Wow.
S03E10,GEORGE,What should I do?
S03E10,JERRY,Go! What could you do?
S03E10,GEORGE,What about you and Elaine?
S03E10,JERRY,We'll get a ride.
S03E10,GEORGE,Are you sure?
S03E10,JERRY,"We'll be fine, what did she say?"
S03E10,GEORGE,She told me she wants-- (Pauses until a woman coming down the stairs passes) She told me she wants me to make love to her.
S03E10,JERRY,What? She said that?
S03E10,GEORGE,Yeah.
S03E10,JERRY,Get out of here.
S03E10,GEORGE,I swear.
S03E10,JERRY,What did you say?
S03E10,GEORGE,"I, I, I can't."
S03E10,JERRY,What did you say?
S03E10,GEORGE,"Please, it's--"
S03E10,JERRY,What?
S03E10,GEORGE,I... I... I long for you.
S03E10,JERRY,I long for you?
S03E10,GEORGE,I was so shocked I was lucky I said anything.
S03E10,JERRY,"It's okay, that's not bad."
S03E10,GEORGE,"I don't like when a woman says, 'Make love to me', it's intimidating. The last time a woman said that to me, I wound up apologizing to her."
S03E10,JERRY,Really?
S03E10,GEORGE,"That's a lot of pressure. Make love to me. What am I, in the circus? What if I can't deliver?"
S03E10,JERRY,"Oh, come on."
S03E10,GEORGE,"I can't perform under pressure. That's why I never play anything for money, I choke. I could choke tonight. And she works in my office, can you imagine? She goes around telling everyone what happened? Maybe I should cancel, I have a very bad feeling about this."
S03E10,JERRY,"George, you're thinking too much."
S03E10,GEORGE,"I know, I know, I can't stop it!"
S03E10,ELAINE,"Well, right now I'm reading manuscripts for Pendant Publishing."
S03E10,JERRY,(walking up) Pendant? Those bastards.
S03E10,ELAINE,Excuse me.
S03E10,JERRY,"Listen, George is going home with this Ava from his office"
S03E10,ELAINE,Really? Huh. What a world. So we can go now?
S03E10,JERRY,"Uh, no, he's taking the car."
S03E10,ELAINE,"Well, what are we gonna do for a ride?"
S03E10,JERRY,I don't know.
S03E10,ELAINE,You don't know?
S03E10,JERRY,Maybe Kramer can come pick us up.
S03E10,ELAINE,"Oh great, oh, this is great. How could you let him take the car?"
S03E10,JERRY,"There's nothing I could do, it's part of the code."
S03E10,ELAINE,(noticing Ava in a fur) Oh look at that. Look at what she's wearing. You see what she's wearing?
S03E10,JERRY,"Yeah, yeah, alright."
S03E10,ELAINE,I can't believe she's walking around in that.
S03E10,JERRY,Just don't make a scene.
S03E10,ELAINE,"Hey, is that real fur?"
S03E10,JERRY,Oh boy.
S03E10,AVA,It better be or my ex-husband owes me an explanation.
S03E10,GEORGE,"Yeah, good night."
S03E10,ELAINE,You don't care that innocent defenseless animals are being tortured so that you can look good?
S03E10,GEORGE,Could we talk about this some other time?
S03E10,AVA,Are you a vegetarian?
S03E10,JERRY,Here we go.
S03E10,ELAINE,"Yeah, I eat fish occasionally."
S03E10,AVA,So you're a hypocrite.
S03E10,GEORGE,"Hey, I've eaten frogs, so nobody's perfect. Anyway-"
S03E10,AVA,"Well, talk to me when you stop eating fish."
S03E10,ELAINE,Fish don't feel any pain.
S03E10,AVA,How do you know? Do you communicate with fish?
S03E10,ELAINE,"Well, they're not kept in little cages."
S03E10,AVA,Ever seen a goldfish?
S03E10,GEORGE,Goldfish.
S03E10,ELAINE,"Yeah, yeah I've seen goldfish. They're not unhappy."
S03E10,AVA,"Oh yeah, right. Swim around in a bowl for two weeks and get flushed down the toilet, that's a good life. (To George) Let's go."
S03E10,ELAINE,"Oh yeah, that's right. Go ahead, go ahead, maybe you can run over a squirrel!"
S03E10,GEORGE,That's why we're here in America.
S03E10,JERRY,You're beautiful.
S03E10,ELAINE,Call Kramer.
S03E10,JERRY,"Alright. (Approaches host) Excuse me, this is your party, right?"
S03E10,STEVE,"No, I just live here."
S03E10,JERRY,Can I use your phone?
S03E10,STEVE,What's in it for me?
S03E10,JERRY,A bigger bill?
S03E10,STEVE,"He he, go for it."
S03E10,JERRY,"Krame? Sein. What are you doing? Well, I'm stuck out here on Long Island. What are your thoughts about taking a ride? You sure? Okay, but don't leave me hanging here. Okay, great. Let me give you directions."
S03E10,ELAINE,You sure you don't need any help?
S03E10,JENNY,"No, not really."
S03E10,JERRY,I'm sure he'll be here any minute.
S03E10,JENNY,(To Steve) I want them out of here.
S03E10,ELAINE,Call him again.
S03E10,JERRY,"I called, what should I do? (To Jenny) We really appreciate this."
S03E10,JENNY,(To Steve) It's two o'clock in the morning.
S03E10,JERRY,"(noticing a coffee table book) Oh, you got the Civil War book. I saw some of that show, it was wonderful."
S03E10,ELAINE,Six hundred and twenty million people died.
S03E10,JERRY,Thousand.
S03E10,ELAINE,"Thousand. Six hundred and twenty thousand. The horror, the horror. (To Jerry) The wife keeps giving us dirty looks. Are you sure you gave him the right directions?"
S03E10,JERRY,Yes. (To Jenny) You're sure there's nothing we can do?
S03E10,JENNY,"No! (To Steve) I am not going to bed with them in our house, this is ridiculous."
S03E10,JERRY,You know a friend of my father's used to live right around here. Mike Wichter. He sold plastic straws. You know the ones? You could bend them.
S03E10,ELAINE,"Have you noticed, people don't use straws as much as they used to for some reason."
S03E10,JENNY,"You know, it doesn't look as if your friend is coming."
S03E10,JERRY,"Oh, he's coming."
S03E10,JENNY,Maybe you should take a look at a train schedule.
S03E10,JERRY,That's him.
S03E10,JENNY,I'm going to bed!
S03E10,ELAINE,Thanks a lot.
S03E10,JERRY,"Thanks, great party."
S03E10,KRAMER,"Hey, how ya doing?"
S03E10,STEVE,"Ah, look who's here."
S03E10,KRAMER,I'm sorry.
S03E10,JERRY,"Hey, it's okay."
S03E10,KRAMER,"I had the directions on the seat right next to me, they flew out the window."
S03E10,ELAINE,Then how did you find the place?
S03E10,KRAMER,"Well I knew the exit on the Long Island Expressway, and I thought that the address was 8713 Riviera Drive. Uh uh, so I drove around knocking on everybody's doors that had those numbers; 8317, 7813, 3718, 1837, whoo. Finally, I hit it. 8173."
S03E10,JERRY,"Anyway, thanks a lot for letting us stay here, Steve, I really owe you one."
S03E10,STEVE,No problem.
S03E10,JERRY,"And if you're ever in the city, you know, you want to come to a comedy club, whatever."
S03E10,STEVE,"Hey, I might take you up on that."
S03E10,JERRY,"(writing) Here's my address and number. And really, thanks again."
S03E10,KRAMER,(to Elaine) You better zip up. I couldn't get the top on the convertible up.
S03E10,ELAINE,But it's cold out.
S03E10,KRAMER,"Yeah, wait till we get on the Expressway."
S03E10,JERRY,"George, I've been sick all week. Elaine was too. Eighty miles an hour, forty degree temperature for fifty minutes. Do the math. Yeah, maybe I will get out. Hey, let me just stop off at the drug store first. Okay, meet me down there in fifteen minutes then we'll go do something. Yeah, Selwyn's. Okay bye."
S03E10,JERRY,Who is it?
S03E10,VOICE,Mr. Pocatello.
S03E10,JERRY,Who?
S03E10,VOICE,You mean you don't recognize my voice?
S03E10,STEVE,"Jerry, baby!"
S03E10,JERRY,Do I know you?
S03E10,STEVE,Boy this comedy's really frying your brain.
S03E10,JERRY,"I'm sorry, uh-"
S03E10,STEVE,"See, this is the kind of lasting impression I make on people."
S03E10,JERRY,"Oh, okay."
S03E10,STEVE,"You said if I was ever in the city, I'm in the city."
S03E10,JERRY,You certainly are. What's going on?
S03E10,STEVE,"I'm just waiting for a lift back to the island, he won't be ready until eleven, so I figured I'd give you a break. I thought I'd see what it was like to hang out with someone in show business."
S03E10,JERRY,"Listen, I'm really sorry but I'm just on my way out to meet a friend."
S03E10,STEVE,"Oh, come on, you can come up with something better than that."
S03E10,JERRY,"No, really, I just got off the phone with him."
S03E10,STEVE,I understand.
S03E10,JERRY,"Look, you can hang out here if you want."
S03E10,STEVE,Don't be so enthusiastic.
S03E10,JERRY,"No, it's-"
S03E10,STEVE,I'm not gonna steal anything.
S03E10,JERRY,"No, of course not, just close the door when you leave."
S03E10,STEVE,I think I can do that.
S03E10,JERRY,"Really, I'm sorry. Maybe another time."
S03E10,STEVE,Yeah. Let's have lunch.
S03E10,JERRY,"They guy's in my house right now. What a mistake that party was, I never should have gone."
S03E10,GEORGE,"Yeah, me either."
S03E10,JERRY,"Oh, come on."
S03E10,GEORGE,What come on? Have you ever dated a woman that worked in your office?
S03E10,JERRY,I've never had a job.
S03E10,GEORGE,"You know the anxiety you feel on a date? That's what I have every day now. My worst nightmare's come true, every day is a date."
S03E10,JERRY,"That's one of Dante's nine stages of hell, isn't it?"
S03E10,GEORGE,"Ava was one of the reasons I used to like going to work, she was a friend. Now we sleep together and suddenly, I don't know how to talk to her. Every time I go to the bathroom I pass her desk. I have to plan little patter. I spend half my day writing. Then afterwards, I sit in my office and analyze how it went. If it was a good conversation, I don't go to the bathroom for the rest of the day. I see her laughing and talking with other people, they're all so loose and relaxed, I think, 'that used to be me. I want to go back there again.'"
S03E10,JERRY,What are you gonna do?
S03E10,GEORGE,"I have no choice, I'm quitting."
S03E10,KRAMER,"The party, Long Island?"
S03E10,STEVE,"Kramer, right?"
S03E10,KRAMER,"Hey, what are you doing here?"
S03E10,STEVE,I'm waiting for my ride.
S03E10,KRAMER,Where's Jerry?
S03E10,STEVE,"He split. Let me ask you something. Is there anything to drink in here or is that, like, a stupid question?"
S03E10,KRAMER,"Well, Jerry, he doesn't have anything. (Sensing Steve's disappointment) Well, but I might have something."
S03E10,JERRY,"Alright, I'm gonna get this. This looks good."
S03E10,GEORGE,How much is that?
S03E10,JERRY,Nine sixty.
S03E10,GEORGE,Nine sixty? Give it to me.
S03E10,JERRY,Why?
S03E10,GEORGE,"Don't worry, I got it."
S03E10,JERRY,"What do you mean, you got it?"
S03E10,GEORGE,I got it.
S03E10,JERRY,"Since when are you treating me to medicine? What are you doing? You're stealing this, aren't you?"
S03E10,GEORGE,I'm not stealing it. They owe me ten dollars. They stole from me.
S03E10,JERRY,You're a lunatic.
S03E10,GEORGE,"I have to do this, it's a matter of honor."
S03E10,JERRY,What do you say to a person like you?
S03E10,GEORGE,Just walk.
S03E10,JERRY,Oh.
S03E10,SECURITY GUARD,Scuse me. What do you got there?
S03E10,GEORGE,What?
S03E10,SECURITY GUARD,What do you got in your shirt?
S03E10,GEORGE,"Oh, I was gonna pay for this."
S03E10,SECURITY GUARD,(grabbing George by the elbow and walking him to the counter) Come with me.
S03E10,GEORGE,(nervous) Where are you taking me? I was gonna pay for it.
S03E10,CASHIER,um-hmm.
S03E10,SECURITY GUARD,You don't think I remember you?
S03E10,GEORGE,(more nervous) What are you talking about?
S03E10,SECURITY GUARD,"I know who you are, I was watching you."
S03E10,GEORGE,(panicky) What are you gonna do? Are you gonna call the police?
S03E10,JERRY,Can I still buy this or is this evidence now?
S03E10,KRAMER,"So, I'm chasing these doves down the street and she's screaming at the top of her lungs, and then when the magician comes back from Europe, two of them turned brown! Well I followed the instructions!"
S03E10,STEVE,"(hysterical) Ah, they turned brown!! Brown!! (the laughter winds down) So let me ask you something, you know any women we could call?"
S03E10,KRAMER,Not really.
S03E10,STEVE,Maybe we should call one of those escort services. I saw one of them advertised before on the cable station.
S03E10,KRAMER,(handing Steve the phone) 555-LOVE.
S03E10,STEVE,"Hey, you want in on this?"
S03E10,KRAMER,"No, I got a girl in the next building"
S03E10,VOICE,"Now I want my money, mister, and I ain't leaving until I get it. Now I am through playing games with you, I got things to do."
S03E10,STEVE,"(drunk and slurring) Oh Jerry! Jerry! Look who's here, it's Jerry"
S03E10,JERRY,What the hell?
S03E10,STEVE,"Jerry, this is Patti."
S03E10,JERRY,Nice to meet you.
S03E10,PATTI,"It's a pleasure to make your acquaintance, I'm sure."
S03E10,JERRY,What the hell is going on here?
S03E10,STEVE,"I don't know, but I gotta do this more often. (The buzzer goes off) Ooh, there's my ride, finally."
S03E10,PATTI,I'm not gonna go anywhere until I get the rest of my money.
S03E10,STEVE,"See ya, Jerr. And tell Kramer thanks and I'll call him tomorrow."
S03E10,JERRY,"Oh, Kramer huh?"
S03E10,STEVE,"Yeah, he's a hoot. Oh, goodbye, my dear. (trying to kiss Patti's hand as she pulls it away) Ouch. (To Jerry) Weekend of the 26th, come on out, we're having another party."
S03E10,PATTI,I ain't leaving.
S03E10,JERRY,Patti?
S03E10,PATTI,You got anything to drink?
S03E10,JERRY,"Alright, how much does he owe you?"
S03E10,PATTI,Fifty dollars.
S03E10,JERRY,(taking out his wallet and handing over bills grudgingly) Fifty dollars.
S03E10,COP,This your apartment?
S03E10,JERRY,"Yeah, but--"
S03E10,COP,You're under arrest for solicitation of prostitution.
S03E10,JERRY,"Wait a second, I--"
S03E10,ELAINE,I brought you chicken soup. (To Patti) Is that real fur?
S03E10,JERRY & COP,Oh boy.
S03E10,GEORGE,You had Sgt. Chadway? Me too.
S03E10,JERRY,He was a nice guy.
S03E10,GEORGE,"Oh, great guy."
S03E10,JERRY,Was there a red-headed guy there?
S03E10,GEORGE,The one with the long sideburns?
S03E10,JERRY,Yeah.
S03E10,GEORGE,Where does he come off?
S03E10,JERRY,"Yeah, I know. There's no call for that kind of attitude."
S03E10,GEORGE,One of the guys in my cell threw a piece of gum at him.
S03E10,JERRY,"Oh, we all hated him."
S03E11,JERRY,Do you believe this? The car was parked right out front.
S03E11,GEORGE,Was the alarm on?
S03E11,JERRY,"I don't know, I guess it was on. I don't know my alarm sound; I'm not tuned in to it like it's my son."
S03E11,GEORGE,"I don't understand, how do these thieves start the car?"
S03E11,JERRY,They cross the wires or something.
S03E11,GEORGE,Cross the wires? I can't even make a pot of spaghetti.
S03E11,JERRY,They stole my car.
S03E11,KRAMER,Who did?
S03E11,JERRY,They did.
S03E11,KRAMER,Was it more than just one?
S03E11,JERRY,"What should I do, should I call the police?"
S03E11,KRAMER,What are they gonna do?
S03E11,JERRY,"I'd better call the car phone company, cancel my service."
S03E11,GEORGE,Maybe you should call your car phone.
S03E11,JERRY,"Yeah, he's probably driving it right now."
S03E11,GEORGE,"Wait a minute, call the car phone, see what happens."
S03E11,JERRY,Are you serious?
S03E11,GEORGE,"Yeah, go ahead, call."
S03E11,JERRY,I don't even know if I remember the number.
S03E11,JERRY,What do I say if he picks up?
S03E11,CAR THIEF,Hello?
S03E11,JERRY,Hello? Is this 555-8383?
S03E11,CAR THIEF,I have no idea.
S03E11,JERRY,Can I ask you a question?
S03E11,CAR THIEF,Sure.
S03E11,JERRY,Did you steal my car?
S03E11,CAR THIEF,Yes I did.
S03E11,JERRY,You did?!
S03E11,CAR THIEF,I did.
S03E11,JERRY,That's my car!
S03E11,CAR THIEF,I didn't know it was yours.
S03E11,JERRY,What are you gonna do with it?
S03E11,CAR THIEF,"I dunno, drive around."
S03E11,JERRY,Then can I have it back?
S03E11,CAR THIEF,"Mmmm, nah, I'm gonna keep it."
S03E11,KRAMER,Hello?
S03E11,CAR THIEF,"Yeah, who's this?"
S03E11,KRAMER,Kramer.
S03E11,CAR THIEF,"Hello, Kramer."
S03E11,KRAMER,"Listen, there's a pair of gloves in the glove compartment."
S03E11,CAR THIEF,"Wait, hold on... Brown ones?"
S03E11,KRAMER,"Yeah. Listen, could you mail those to me? Or bring them by my building, it's 129 West 81st St."
S03E11,CAR THIEF,"One-two-nine, okay."
S03E11,KRAMER,"Thanks a lot, uh here's Jerry."
S03E11,JERRY,(derisively at Kramer) Gloves. (Into the phone) Hello?
S03E11,CAR THIEF,Jerry?
S03E11,JERRY,"Yeah, let me ask you a question. How do you cross those wires?"
S03E11,CAR THIEF,"I didn't cross any wires, the keys were in it."
S03E11,JERRY,"Sid left the keys in the car. Alright, I gotta go. Drive carefully."
S03E11,CAR THIEF,"Jerry, when's the last time you had a tune-up? Because I can't find the--"
S03E11,JERRY,Sid left the keys in the car.
S03E11,GEORGE,Who's Sid?
S03E11,JERRY,"He's this guy in the neighborhood, parks cars on the block."
S03E11,GEORGE,What do you mean?
S03E11,JERRY,He moves them from one side of the street to the other so you don't get a ticket.
S03E11,GEORGE,"What, do you pay him for that?"
S03E11,JERRY,"Yeah, like fifty bucks a month."
S03E11,GEORGE,How many people does he do that for?
S03E11,JERRY,"The whole block, forty, fifty cars."
S03E11,KRAMER,"He only works three hours a day. He makes a fortune. Course he's been doing that for years, right Jerry?"
S03E11,GEORGE,Could anybody do that?
S03E11,JERRY,"Hey Sid, what happened?"
S03E11,SID,"I'm sorry, Jerry. Maybe I'm getting too old for this stuff."
S03E11,JERRY,You left the keys in the car?
S03E11,SID,"Well, you know they're making that Woody Allen movie in the block, and all those people and trucks everywhere, when I saw him I must have got a little distracted."
S03E11,KRAMER,You know I'm in that movie?
S03E11,GEORGE,You are?
S03E11,KRAMER,"Yeah, I'm an extra."
S03E11,GEORGE,How'd you get that?
S03E11,KRAMER,"Well, I was just watching them film yesterday and some guy just asked me."
S03E11,GEORGE,Right out of the clear blue sky?
S03E11,KRAMER,Clear blue sky!
S03E11,GEORGE,"Well, why didn't they ask me?"
S03E11,KRAMER,I got a quality.
S03E11,SID,"Jerry, you got insurance, right?"
S03E11,JERRY,"Yeah, but no car. I'll have to rent one."
S03E11,SID,"Well I'm going down to visit my sister in Virginia next Wednesday, for a week, so I can't park it."
S03E11,JERRY,This Wednesday?
S03E11,SID,"No, next Wednesday, week after this Wednesday."
S03E11,JERRY,But the Wednesday two days from now is the next Wednesday.
S03E11,SID,"If I meant this Wednesday, I would have said this Wednesday. It's the week after this Wednesday."
S03E11,GEORGE,"Sid, who's gonna move the cars while you're away?"
S03E11,SID,"Whoever wants to move them, why do I care who moves them? They can move themselves if they want."
S03E11,GEORGE,Maybe I could move them until you get back.
S03E11,SID,What's a young man like you want to move cars for? You don't work?
S03E11,GEORGE,I'm in a transition phase right now.
S03E11,SID,"Well if you want to move the cars, move the cars. Just don't forget to take the keys out, that's all."
S03E11,JERRY,"Hello? Yeah, the defroster's the one on the bottom, just slide it all the way over. You're welcome."
S03E11,ELAINE,"I'm in awe of his intellect, when he talks it sounds like he's reading from one of his novels."
S03E11,JERRY,"Owen March, I never heard of him."
S03E11,ELAINE,"Well, he's not a baseball player."
S03E11,JERRY,"Yeah, that's true. Well it sounds like it's going pretty good."
S03E11,ELAINE,"Yeah. Well, there is one little problem."
S03E11,JERRY,What's that?
S03E11,ELAINE,He's sixty-six years old.
S03E11,RENTAL CAR AGENT,Next please.
S03E11,ELAINE,"Well, go, go."
S03E11,RENTAL CAR AGENT,Can I help you? Name please?
S03E11,JERRY,"Seinfeld. I made a reservation for a mid-size, and she's a small. I'm kidding around, of course."
S03E11,RENTAL CAR AGENT,"Okay, let's see here."
S03E11,JERRY,Sixty-six years old?
S03E11,ELAINE,"Yeah, well, he's in perfect health. He works out, he's vibrant. You'd really like him."
S03E11,JERRY,"Why do people always say that? I hate everyone, why would I like him?"
S03E11,ELAINE,"What do you think, would you go out with a sixty-six year old woman?"
S03E11,JERRY,"Well, I'll tell you, she would have to be really vibrant. So vibrant, she'd be spinning."
S03E11,RENTAL CAR AGENT,"I'm sorry, we have no mid-size available at the moment."
S03E11,JERRY,"I don't understand, I made a reservation, do you have my reservation?"
S03E11,RENTAL CAR AGENT,"Yes, we do, unfortunately we ran out of cars."
S03E11,JERRY,But the reservation keeps the car here. That's why you have the reservation.
S03E11,RENTAL CAR AGENT,I know why we have reservations.
S03E11,JERRY,"I don't think you do. If you did, I'd have a car. See, you know how to take the reservation, you just don't know how to *hold* the reservation and that's really the most important part of the reservation, the holding. Anybody can just take them."
S03E11,RENTAL CAR AGENT,"Let me, uh, speak with my supervisor."
S03E11,JERRY,"Uh, here we go. The supervisor. You know what she's saying over there?"
S03E11,ELAINE,What?
S03E11,JERRY,"Hey Marge, you see those two people over there? They think I'm talking to you, so you pretend like you're talking to me, okay now you start talking."
S03E11,ELAINE,"Oh, you mean like this? So it looks like I'm saying something but I'm not really saying anything at all?"
S03E11,JERRY,Now you say something else and they won't yell at me 'cause they thought I was checking with you.
S03E11,ELAINE,"Okay, that's it. I think that's enough, see you later."
S03E11,RENTAL CAR AGENT,"I'm sorry, my supervisor says there's nothing we can do."
S03E11,JERRY,"Yeah, it looked as if you were in a real conversation over there."
S03E11,RENTAL CAR AGENT,But we do have a compact if you would like that.
S03E11,JERRY,Fine.
S03E11,RENTAL CAR AGENT,Alright. We have a blue Ford Escort for you Mr. Seinfeld. Would you like insurance?
S03E11,JERRY,"Yeah, you better give me the insurance, because I am gonna beat the hell out of this car."
S03E11,RENTAL CAR AGENT,Please fill this out.
S03E11,ELAINE,"What do you think, you think I'm making a big mistake?"
S03E11,JERRY,"Hey, if you enjoy being with him, that's what's important."
S03E11,ELAINE,"I love being with him. I mean, I like being with him. It's okay being with him."
S03E11,ELAINE,I just don't enjoy being with him.
S03E11,JERRY,Well that's what's important.
S03E11,ELAINE,"I'm meeting him for lunch at Chadway's around the corner, do I have to break up with him face to face or can I just wait and do it over the phone?"
S03E11,JERRY,How many times you been out with him?
S03E11,ELAINE,Seven?
S03E11,JERRY,Face to face.
S03E11,ELAINE,Seven dates is a face-to-face break up?
S03E11,JERRY,"If it was six I could have let you go, but seven, I'm afraid, is over the limit. Unless, of course, there was no sex."
S03E11,ELAINE,Hmm... How's the pasta over there?
S03E11,KRAMER,"Whoa, whoa!!"
S03E11,JERRY,What is going on out there?
S03E11,GEORGE,"I need like a bucket of water! I got a car overheating, I got an alarm that won't go off, I'm pressing 'one', I'm pressing 'two', nothing! What do I do?! Help me! Help me!"
S03E11,KRAMER,"Hey, you know they were supposed to do my scene today?"
S03E11,ELAINE,Today?!
S03E11,KRAMER,You know they told me that they wanted me to walk down the block carrying this bag of groceries.
S03E11,ELAINE,Yeah.
S03E11,KRAMER,"So I start to walk, and I trip, and the grocery bag goes flying, and Woody, Woody starts laughing."
S03E11,ELAINE,He was laughing?!
S03E11,KRAMER,"Oh yeah, he was drinking something, it started to come out of his nose."
S03E11,JERRY,So then what?
S03E11,KRAMER,I got a line in the movie!
S03E11,ELAINE,Get out!
S03E11,JERRY,That's great!
S03E11,GEORGE,You got a line in the Woody Allen movie?
S03E11,KRAMER,"Pretty good, huh?"
S03E11,GEORGE,You're in the movie? Is he in the scene?
S03E11,KRAMER,"Oh yeah, yeah, it's me and him. I might have a whole new career on my hands, huh?"
S03E11,JERRY,You mean *a* career.
S03E11,ELAINE,So was Mia Farrow there?
S03E11,KRAMER,"Uh, I didn't see him."
S03E11,ELAINE,What's your line?
S03E11,KRAMER,"Oh, well uh, okay I'm there with, uh, Woody, you know, I'm at this bar and, uh, I'm sit-- you know it's Woody Allen, did I mention that?"
S03E11,KRAMER,"So I'm sitting there with Woody and I say, I turn to him and I go, ""Boy, these pretzels are making me thirsty."""
S03E11,GEORGE,Is that how you're gonna say it?
S03E11,KRAMER,"No, no, I'm working on it."
S03E11,ELAINE,"Do it like this. ""These pretzels are making me thirsty."""
S03E11,JERRY,"No. ""These pretzels are making me thirsty."""
S03E11,KRAMER,"No, no. See, that's no good. See, you don't know how to act."
S03E11,GEORGE,"""These pretzels are making me thirsty!!"""
S03E11,GEORGE,That was no good?
S03E11,KRAMER,I didn't say anything.
S03E11,ELAINE,I'm gonna go break up with Owen.
S03E11,GEORGE,What was wrong with that? I had a different interpretation! Do you know anything about this pretzel guy?! Maybe he's been in the bar a really long time and he's really depressed because he has no job and no woman and he's parking cars for a living! (out the window to honking cars) Alright! Alright! Shut up! Shut up! I hear you! I'm coming down! These pretzels are making me thirsty!
S03E11,JERRY,Oh my god.
S03E11,ELAINE,Call an ambulance.
S03E11,JERRY,"Boy, he took it hard."
S03E11,ELAINE,We were walking down the block right by your house and I was just about to break up with him then all of a sudden he started to twitch.
S03E11,JERRY,"(on the phone) Hello? Yes, I need an ambulance at one twenty nine west Eighty-first Street, apartment five-A."
S03E11,ELAINE,Tell then to hurry! Hurry!
S03E11,JERRY,(To Elaine) It's an ambulance. (To the operator) I don't know but he's unconscious.
S03E11,KRAMER,"These pretzels are making me thirsty. (He bites into a pretzel.) Boy, these pretzels are making me thirsty."
S03E11,JERRY,Kramer.
S03E11,KRAMER,What happened here?
S03E11,ELAINE,"I don't know, I don't know, what should we do? We called an ambulance, does anyone know first aid?"
S03E11,JERRY,Shouldn't you do something with the extremities?
S03E11,ELAINE,What extremities?
S03E11,KRAMER,What's an extremity?
S03E11,JERRY,"You raise the feet, get blood to the head."
S03E11,KRAMER,"You raise the head, you get blood to the feet."
S03E11,ELAINE,"Okay, what about a cold compress? They always do that."
S03E11,JERRY,I don't have a washcloth.
S03E11,ELAINE,Well use a paper towel.
S03E11,JERRY,You can't put a paper towel on his head.
S03E11,KRAMER,What about a big sponge?
S03E11,JERRY,How you gonna hold it on there?
S03E11,KRAMER,Use a belt.
S03E11,ELAINE,"No no no no no, that'll, it'll drip all over him."
S03E11,JERRY,Should we walk him around?
S03E11,ELAINE and KRAMER,"(at the same time) Yes, yes."
S03E11,KRAMER,"Yeah, I've seen them do that."
S03E11,JERRY,"No, no that's for a drug overdose."
S03E11,KRAMER,Maybe that's what he's got.
S03E11,ELAINE,"No no no no, Kramer, I just had lunch with him, he didn't leave the table."
S03E11,KRAMER,Well he could have dropped acid when you weren't looking.
S03E11,ELAINE,He is not a drug addict!
S03E11,JERRY,"Hey, you know what? Maybe he's a diabetic, he might just need a cookie or something."
S03E11,ELAINE,A cookie!
S03E11,KRAMER,Can you give him a cookie?
S03E11,ELAINE,How's he gonna chew it?
S03E11,JERRY,"We'll move his teeth, it happened to my uncle, the sugar revived him."
S03E11,ELAINE,"Careful, you're getting crumbs all over him."
S03E11,KRAMER,I got him chewing but I don't think he's gonna swallow.
S03E11,ELAINE,"You know what, let's put a few cookies in a blender and he could drink it."
S03E11,JERRY,Cookies don't liquefy.
S03E11,ELAINE,"Yes they do, you can liquefy a cookie."
S03E11,KRAMER,Alright I'll get a blender.
S03E11,JERRY,What blender? I don't have a blender.
S03E11,KRAMER,You got a blender.
S03E11,JERRY,I would know if I had a blender.
S03E11,ELAINE,Where is the ambulance?!
S03E11,JERRY,"(on phone) Hello, yes, I called for an ambulance like thirty-five minutes ago."
S03E11,ELAINE,I can't believe what's going on out here.
S03E11,JERRY,"This is an emergency, what's taking so long? (the door buzzer buzzes) Wait a second, maybe that's them. (presses button) Hello?"
S03E11,VOICE,Paramedics.
S03E11,JERRY,"Come on up. Okay, they're here."
S03E11,ELAINE,He seems to be breathing.
S03E11,JERRY,"Ya know, I gotta tell you, he's a pretty good-looking guy."
S03E11,ELAINE,I know.
S03E11,JERRY,"Those eyebrows could use a trimming, you ever mention that to him?"
S03E11,ELAINE,Almost.
S03E11,JERRY,"Hey, look at this, c'mon, running wild there."
S03E11,ELAINE,It's not an easy thing to bring up.
S03E11,JERRY,"Yeah, that's true."
S03E11,ELAINE,"Aw, you should see his bathrobe, man, it's all silk."
S03E11,JERRY,Yeah? Does he wear slippers? I bet he wears slippers.
S03E11,ELAINE,"He does, how'd you know that?"
S03E11,JERRY,I could tell.
S03E11,ELAINE,"What happened, what took you so long?!"
S03E11,PARAMEDIC,"We got here twenty minutes ago but we couldn't move, the whole intersection is gridlocked, I've never seen anything like it. So finally we make the turn and this guy who's running around triple-parking cars slammed into us with a blue Escort."
S03E11,JERRY,Blue Escort? That's my rent-a-car!
S03E11,GEORGE,Oh man.
S03E11,JERRY,What happened to the car?
S03E11,GEORGE,"Sorry, you don't know what's going on out there! (looks at Owen) Who's he?"
S03E11,ELAINE,This guy I'm seeing.
S03E11,GEORGE,What happened?
S03E11,JERRY,We don't know!
S03E11,PARAMEDIC,Who put cookies in his mouth?
S03E11,JERRY and ELAINE,Cookies?
S03E11,PARAMEDIC,You're not supposed to do that.
S03E11,JERRY,So how'd you hit the car?
S03E11,GEORGE,"I was moving it across the street, I looked up and I saw Woody Allen and I got all distracted."
S03E11,JERRY,"It's not even my car, it's a rental."
S03E11,KRAMER,"What are you doing out there?! You're holding up the production of the movie! We can't shoot and Woody, he's really mad at you."
S03E11,GEORGE,Woody mentioned me? What did he say?
S03E11,KRAMER,"He said, 'Who's the moron in the blue jacket who's got the street all screwed up?'"
S03E11,GEORGE,Should I apologize to Woody?
S03E11,KRAMER,"Alright, I'll tell you what. Next time I talk to him, maybe I'll bring it up. I'll feel him out."
S03E11,SID,Now you didn't tell me you didn't know how to drive. You should have mentioned that.
S03E11,GEORGE,Well I know how to drive.
S03E11,SID,Then how'd all those cars get damaged? Why are people calling me up screaming on the phone? Most of them cancelled out on me.
S03E11,JERRY,Can I get anybody anything?
S03E11,SID,Moving cars from one side of the street to the other don't take no more sense than putting on a pair of pants. My question to you is who's putting your pants on?
S03E11,GEORGE,"I put my pants on, Sid."
S03E11,SID,"I don't believe you. If you can put your pants on, you can move those cars."
S03E11,GEORGE,Well I don't want to get into a big dispute about the pants.
S03E11,SID,Who's gonna send money to my sister in Virginia? Her little boy needs surgery on his foot. Now he'll be walking around with a limp because you can't park a few cars.
S03E11,GEORGE,Maybe I could call my father.
S03E11,KRAMER,"Hey, you seen the paper yet?"
S03E11,JERRY,"Interestingly enough, no, inasmuch as it is my paper."
S03E11,KRAMER,Yeah. There's an article in there about that writer.
S03E11,JERRY,"(reading) Owen March, prominent author and essayist suffered a stroke yesterday in the upper West Side apartment of a friend."
S03E11,KRAMER,"Uh huh, that's the guy that was here. You're the friend."
S03E11,JERRY,(continuing) The extent of the damage would have been far less severe had paramedics been able to reach him sooner.
S03E11,SID,Oh lord.
S03E11,JERRY,(finishing) The commotion also delayed production of a Woody Allen movie that was shooting up the block. A spokeswoman for the legendary filmmaker said that Mr. Allen was extremely agitated and wondered if his days of shooting movies in New York were over.
S03E11,ELAINE,"Five seconds. Jerry, I was five seconds away from breaking up with him. Five seconds. The next words out of my mouth were, 'Owen, it's over.'"
S03E11,JERRY,Can he communicate?
S03E11,ELAINE,"Yeah, well, he nods. And I think he understands me, he seems to enjoy it when I read to him."
S03E11,JERRY,"Alright, she's free. (Steps up to the counter) Hi, I called before, uh, my car got smashed."
S03E11,ELAINE,"So listen, what should I do? I mean if I break up with him now it'll look like I'm abandoning him because of his condition, I'll be ostracized from the community."
S03E11,JERRY,What community? There's a community?
S03E11,ELAINE,Of course there's a community.
S03E11,JERRY,"All these years I'm living in a community, I had no idea."
S03E11,RENTAL CAR AGENT,Sir the estimate on the damage to your car is two thousand eight hundred and sixty-six dollars.
S03E11,JERRY,"Hmm, well, I got the insurance and everything so..."
S03E11,RENTAL CAR AGENT,"Yes, now, uh, in your report you said that you were not the driver of the car at the time of the accident."
S03E11,JERRY,"That is right, somebody else was driving."
S03E11,RENTAL CAR AGENT,"Alright, well, sir, you're only covered for when you're driving the car."
S03E11,JERRY,"Uh huh, what's that?"
S03E11,RENTAL CAR AGENT,You're not covered for other drivers.
S03E11,JERRY,Other drivers?
S03E11,RENTAL CAR AGENT,Um hm.
S03E11,JERRY,"Your whole business is based on other drivers. It's a rented car. That's who's driving it, other drivers. Doesn't my credit card cover me or something?"
S03E11,RENTAL CAR AGENT,Not that particular one.
S03E11,JERRY,"Well I got a hundred cards, here, pick a card, take a card, any card you want, go ahead, whichever one, I don't care."
S03E11,RENTAL CAR AGENT,"Sir, if you had read the rental agreement--"
S03E11,JERRY,"Did you see the size of that document? It's like the Declaration of Independence, who's gonna read that?"
S03E11,RENTAL CAR AGENT,"Mr. Seinfeld, as it stands right now, you are not covered for that damage and there is absolutely nothing that can be done about that."
S03E11,JERRY,These pretzels are making me thirsty.
S03E11,ELAINE,"Ahh, it's good, isn't it? Yankee Bean. Why Yankee Bean, huh? Don't they have beans in the south? I mean if you order Yankee Bean in the south, are they offended? Huh? (singing) Yankee Bean, Yankee Bean, I like my Yankee Bean. (she puts the bowl down and wipes Owen's mouth with a napkin) Owen, I think we have to talk. I mean, uh, *I* have to talk. It would be nice if *we* could, but, uh, whatever. Um, don't get me wrong, I like coming here, and uh, feeding you and cleaning a little, and paying your bills, that's good stuff. Good stuff! I have a wonderful time when I'm with you, wonderful! But at this point in my life, I'm not really sure that I'm ready to make a commitment to one person. I'm just not really sure that we have enough in common. For example, I like running in the park, bicycling, roller skating, tennis and skiing, and um, well, I'm gonna be brutally honest with you now, Owen, it's a bitch to get here. It's two subways. I have to transfer at Forty-second Street to take the double-R. Anyway, I mean, this doesn't mean we can't be friends. These pretzels are making me thirsty."
S03E11,ELAINE,"Can you die from an odor? I mean, like if you were locked in a vomitorium for two weeks, could you actually die from the odor?"
S03E11,JERRY,An overdose of odor? Good question.
S03E11,GEORGE,Do I smell?
S03E11,ELAINE,"No no no no, I was just down on the forty-second street subway today, it is disgusting. Guess who I bumped into. Owen."
S03E11,JERRY,Ahh.
S03E11,GEORGE,He's alright?
S03E11,ELAINE,"Yeah, he's almost fully recovered. He told me he was just using me for sex."
S03E11,JERRY,Let me get that.
S03E11,GEORGE,"No no no, I got it."
S03E11,JERRY,Please.
S03E11,GEORGE,"No come on, let me, let me. I smashed your car, it cost you over two thousand dollars,"
S03E11,JERRY,"(sarcastically) Yeah, a cup of coffee should cover it."
S03E11,JERRY,What are you doing here?
S03E11,KRAMER,I got fired from the movie.
S03E11,GEORGE,"Get out of here, why?"
S03E11,KRAMER,"Well, you know they were gonna shoot it today, and uh, we rehearsed it twice, then Woody yells 'Action!' and I turn to him and I say, 'These pretzels are making me thirsty' and I took a swig of beer, ya know, and I slammed the glass down on the bar and it shattered."
S03E11,ELAINE,Aww.
S03E11,KRAMER,"Well, one of the pieces must have hit Woody. He started crying. And he yells out, 'I'm bleeding' and he runs off. Anyway, this woman, she came up to me and she says, 'You're fired.' Boy I really nailed that scene."
S03E11,JERRY,"Aw, wait a--. Oh. Oh, for crying out loud."
S03E12,JERRY,"I'm sorry it's gotta be a little bit of a scary place to work. I don't know how you feel about it. You want to be standing there having people comming in all day going ""I need knives. I need more knives. Do you have any bigger knives? I'd like a bigger knife, a big, long, sharp knife, that's what I'm in the market for. I like them really sharp. Do you have one with hooks and gouges like blades and kind of serrated? That's the kind of knife I'm looking for. I need one I can throw. I need another one I can just hack away with. Do you have anything like that?"
S03E12,JERRY,"Oh yeah, like you know what you're talking about."
S03E12,GEORGE,Like you do.
S03E12,JERRY,Well what do you think? They put the statue on a giant raft and a tugboat pulled it all the way from France?
S03E12,GEORGE,What do you think? The brought it over in pieces and screwed it together like a coffee table?
S03E12,JERRY,I don't know. It's too early for a Christmas party isn't it?
S03E12,GEORGE,Why did France give that to us anyway?
S03E12,JERRY,It was a gift.
S03E12,GEORGE,So countries just exchange gifts like that?
S03E12,JERRY,If they like each other.
S03E12,GEORGE,There's Elaine.
S03E12,JERRY,See that guy he's talking with? That's her new boyfriend.
S03E12,GEORGE,Really? They work here in the office?
S03E12,JERRY,Yeah. They're having a little fling so don't say anything.
S03E12,GEORGE,Who am I going to tell? My mother? Like I've got nothing better to talk about.
S03E12,JERRY,You don't. He's a recovering alcoholic.
S03E12,GEORGE,Really?
S03E12,JERRY,Yeah. He's been off the wagon for two years.
S03E12,GEORGE,"""Off the wagon""?"
S03E12,JERRY,I think it's off the wagon.
S03E12,GEORGE,"I think it's ""on the wagon""."
S03E12,ELAINE,"Jerry, George, what are you doing here?"
S03E12,JERRY,What am I doing here? Ba-boom (holding out a present)
S03E12,ELAINE,*gasp* My god! My watch! You found my watch! (pushing Jerry)
S03E12,JERRY,Hey keep your hands to yourself if you know what's good for you.
S03E12,ELAINE,Where did you find it?
S03E12,JERRY,Under the sofa cushion.
S03E12,ELAINE,And you stopped by just to give it to me?
S03E12,JERRY,It's your Christmas present.
S03E12,ELAINE,I though I'd never find it.
S03E12,GEORGE,Well today's your lucky day.
S03E12,ELAINE,No. Today's *your* lucky day.
S03E12,GEORGE,It will be my first one.
S03E12,ELAINE,You want to work here?
S03E12,GEORGE,Huh?
S03E12,ELAINE,"Yeah one of the readers left and there's a job opening. Dick, this is Jerry and this is George."
S03E12,DICK,Hi nice to meet you. Is this the guy?
S03E12,JERRY,"""The guy?"""
S03E12,ELAINE,(softly to Dick) Dick.
S03E12,GEORGE,How can you just get it?
S03E12,ELAINE,"My boss told me to find someone. I'm in charge of it. All you have to do is meet him. Come on. Come on, come on, here hold my drink."
S03E12,JERRY,Cranberry juice?
S03E12,ELAINE,And vodka.
S03E12,DICK,I got the cranberry juice.
S03E12,DICK,So... you're Jerry.
S03E12,JERRY,So... I'm Jerry. (he puts down the drink)
S03E12,MR. LIPPMAN,(What is his name?) So have you ever done this kind of work before?
S03E12,GEORGE,"Well, you know, book reports. That kind of stuff."
S03E12,MR. LIPPMAN,How do you read?
S03E12,GEORGE,I like Mike Lubika.
S03E12,MR. LIPPMAN,Mike Lubika?
S03E12,GEORGE,He's a sports writer for the daily news. I find him very insightful...
S03E12,MR. LIPPMAN,"No, no, no. I mean authors."
S03E12,GEORGE,Lot of good ones. I don't even want to mention anyone because I'm afraid I'm going to leave somebody out.
S03E12,MR. LIPPMAN,Name a couple.
S03E12,GEORGE,"Who do I like? I, like, uh, Art, Vandelay."
S03E12,MR. LIPPMAN,Art Vandelay?
S03E12,GEORGE,"He's an obscure writer. Betnik, on the village."
S03E12,MR. LIPPMAN,What has he written?
S03E12,GEORGE,Venetian Blinds.
S03E12,DICK,(picking up the drink) I've got new for you. I'm funnier than you are.
S03E12,JERRY,Why don't get we together New Years day and watch some football.
S03E12,ELAINE,Where's my drink?
S03E12,JERRY,"There. (turns to George) So, how did it go?"
S03E12,GEORGE,I think he was impressed.
S03E12,ELAINE,"No, no, no, this is just cranberry juice."
S03E12,JERRY,"Oh, uh, I think maybe Dick picked up yours."
S03E12,ELAINE,Dick? He can't drink. He's an alcoholic. I told you to hold it.
S03E12,JERRY,"I didn't know you meant *hold* it, I thought you meant hold it."
S03E12,ELAINE,One drink like that and he could fall right off the wagon.
S03E12,GEORGE,Told you.
S03E12,JERRY,I never feel comfortable in the women's department. I feel like I'm just a *little* too close to trying on a dress.
S03E12,GEORGE,Do I really have to buy her something?
S03E12,JERRY,Hey the woman got you a job. The least you could do is buy her a gift. How about this?
S03E12,GEORGE,What is that? Is that cashmere?
S03E12,JERRY,Yeah. She would love cashmere.
S03E12,GEORGE,Who doesn't like cashmere? Find me one person in the world that doesn't like cashmere. It's too expensive.
S03E12,JERRY,Look at this. It's 85 dollars marked down from 600.
S03E12,GEORGE,"Wow. Excuse me, Miss?"
S03E12,SALES WOMAN,Yes?
S03E12,GEORGE,How come this sweater is only 85 dollars?
S03E12,SALES WOMAN,"(showing the dot) Oh, here. This is why."
S03E12,GEORGE,What? I don't see anything.
S03E12,SALES WOMAN,See this red dot?
S03E12,GEORGE,Oh yeah.
S03E12,JERRY,Oh it's damaged. (grabbing the sweater)
S03E12,GEORGE,(grabbing the sweater back) Well it's not really damaged. 85 dollars huh?
S03E12,SALES WOMAN,There's no exchanges on this.
S03E12,GEORGE,You think she would care about the red dot?
S03E12,JERRY,It's hard to say.
S03E12,GEORGE,I don't even think she'd notice it. Can you see it?
S03E12,JERRY,Well I can see it.
S03E12,GEORGE,"Yeah, but you know where it is."
S03E12,JERRY,Well what do you want me to do? Not look at it?
S03E12,GEORGE,Pretend you didn't know it was there. Can you see it?
S03E12,JERRY,It's hard to pretend because I know where it is.
S03E12,GEORGE,Well just take an overview. Can't you just take an overview?
S03E12,JERRY,You want me to take an overview?
S03E12,GEORGE,Please.
S03E12,JERRY,I see a very cheap man holding a sweater trying to get away with something. That's my overview.
S03E12,JERRY,Yeah so?
S03E12,ELAINE,He's acting very strangely. I think he started drinking again.
S03E12,JERRY,"Oh boy, can you smell it?"
S03E12,ELAINE,No. I can't smell it.
S03E12,JERRY,Well if you can't smell it then he hasn't been drinking.
S03E12,ELAINE,You don't always smell someone from a drink.
S03E12,JERRY,Yes you do.
S03E12,ELAINE,What about one drink? Would you smell it from one drink?
S03E12,JERRY,Yes you would.
S03E12,JERRY,I'll prove it. Would you do me a favor?
S03E12,KRAMER,Okay.
S03E12,JERRY,Would you take a drink and let us smell you?
S03E12,KRAMER,You can smell me without the drink.
S03E12,ELAINE,I suspect that this guy I'm seeing might be drinking but I can't smell it.
S03E12,KRAMER,"Okay, well what am I drinking? What do you got?"
S03E12,JERRY,I got a bottle of scotch my uncle gave me. It's Hennigans. It's been here for two years. I've been using it as a paint thinner.
S03E12,KRAMER,All right.
S03E12,JERRY,I don't smell anything.
S03E12,ELAINE,Maybe we're too close to the bottle.
S03E12,JERRY,Yeah.
S03E12,GEORGE,(over the speaker) It's George.
S03E12,JERRY,Come on up.
S03E12,KRAMER,"That is *damn* good scotch. I could do a commercial for this stuff. Mmmmm, boy that Hennigans goes down smooth. And afterwords you don't even smell. That's right folks. I just had three shots of Hennigans and I don't smell. Imagine, you can walk around drunk all day. That's Hennigans, the no-smell, no-tell scotch."
S03E12,GEORGE,Hello everybody.
S03E12,KRAMER,"Hey. (snuggling really close to George) I'm going to tell you what I think. I know you don't care what I think, but I'm going to tell you. I think that you are terrific."
S03E12,GEORGE,(uncomfortablly) Thank you.
S03E12,ELAINE,Hey what's that?
S03E12,GEORGE,It's an early Christmas present.
S03E12,ELAINE,Christmas present? For who?
S03E12,GEORGE,For you.
S03E12,ELAINE,*gasp* (pushing George) Get out of here.
S03E12,KRAMER,"Say you got a big job interview, and you're a little nervous. Well throw back a couple shots of Hennigans and you'll be as loose as a goose and ready to roll in no time. And because it's odorless, why, it will be our little secret. (singing) h-e-double n..."
S03E12,JERRY,Kramer. Yeah that'll do.
S03E12,ELAINE,"(opening the present) Oh George, this is beautiful. Is this cashmere?"
S03E12,GEORGE,Of course it's cashmere.
S03E12,ELAINE,"Oh, I love cashmere."
S03E12,GEORGE,Well who doesn't.
S03E12,ELAINE,"My, George this must have cost a fortune."
S03E12,GEORGE,"Ahh, money."
S03E12,ELAINE,"Jerry, how could you let him spend so much money?"
S03E12,JERRY,I tried to stop him. I couldn't. He just wants to make people happy.
S03E12,ELAINE,"George, this is one of the nicest things anyone has ever given me."
S03E12,GEORGE,"Well good, good. Take it off you're going to wear it out already. It's for special occasions this thing."
S03E12,KRAMER,What's that red dot on your sweater?
S03E12,ELAINE,What?
S03E12,GEORGE,Just take it off. I'm getting hot just looking at it.
S03E12,ELAINE,Uhh. This. It's like a red dot.
S03E12,GEORGE,What red dot? What are you talking about? Jerry come here for a second. Do you see anything here?
S03E12,JERRY,"(uncomfortable) Uh, I don't know. Uh, I don't know."
S03E12,ELAINE,What don't you know?
S03E12,JERRY,I don't know.
S03E12,ELAINE,Well do you see it or don't you?
S03E12,JERRY,Ahem. Say that again?
S03E12,ELAINE,Do you see it or don't you?
S03E12,JERRY,Do I see it... or don't I? That's the question.
S03E12,JERRY,Now what did you ask me again.
S03E12,ELAINE,You're still here. You're a dynamo.
S03E12,GEORGE,I can't believe I get paid for this.
S03E12,ELAINE,I'll see you tomorrow.
S03E12,GEORGE,How you doing?
S03E12,CLEANING WOMAN,Hello.
S03E12,JERRY,"You had sex with the cleaning woman on your desk? Who are you, how did you do that?"
S03E12,GEORGE,"Hennigans. I was there sitting in the office and the cleaning woman comes in. I've always been attracted to cleaning women. Cleaning women, chambermaids."
S03E12,JERRY,"Yeah chambermaids, I'm attracted to them too."
S03E12,GEORGE,Why is that?
S03E12,JERRY,It's a woman in your room. So go ahead.
S03E12,GEORGE,"So she starts vaccuming, back and forth, back and forth, her hips swivelling, her breasts, uh... (trying to think of a word)"
S03E12,JERRY,Convulsing?
S03E12,GEORGE,Convulsing?
S03E12,JERRY,"I don't know, I'm trying to help you."
S03E12,GEORGE,Then I asked her if she wanted a drink.
S03E12,JERRY,You don't drink.
S03E12,GEORGE,I know but I couldn't think of anything else to say to her.
S03E12,JERRY,So you started drinking.
S03E12,GEORGE,"So we started drinking, and I'll tell you I don't know if it was the alcohol or the ammonia, but the next think I knew she was mopping the floor with me."
S03E12,JERRY,So how was it?
S03E12,GEORGE,"Well the sex was okay, but I threw up from the Hennigans."
S03E12,JERRY,Good thing the cleaning lady was there.
S03E12,ELAINE,Dick was fired.
S03E12,JERRY,"You mean to tell me if I had put that drink six inches over to the right, and none of this would have happened."
S03E12,ELAINE,You knew he was an alcoholic. Why'd you put the drink down at all?
S03E12,JERRY,What are you saying?
S03E12,ELAINE,I'm not saying anything.
S03E12,JERRY,You're saying something.
S03E12,ELAINE,What could I be saying?
S03E12,JERRY,Well you're not saying nothing you must be saying something.
S03E12,ELAINE,If I was saying something I would have said it.
S03E12,JERRY,Well why don't you say it?
S03E12,ELAINE,I said it.
S03E12,JERRY,What did you say?
S03E12,ELAINE,Nothing. It's exhausting being with you.
S03E12,JERRY,Yeah?
S03E12,GEORGE,(over the speaker) It's George.
S03E12,JERRY,Come on up.
S03E12,ELAINE,"Hey, let me ask you something something. Did George buy that sweater knowing the red dot was on it because it was cheaper? (Jerry is unconfortable) Ooookay, you just gave me the answer."
S03E12,JERRY,No I didn't.
S03E12,ELAINE,"Yes you did, yes you did. I saw your expression."
S03E12,JERRY,I didn't have an expression. I have a deviated septum. I have to open my mouth sometimes to breathe.
S03E12,ELAINE,How much did he save?
S03E12,JERRY,"Frankly I am shocked that you would ask such a question (Elaine sticking out her tongue like she isn't buying a word of it) of me, that you would think - the only surprise is how you could even think of that. That's what you were seeing."
S03E12,GEORGE,"I have to talk to Elaine. This cleaing lady is turning the screws on me. She's pushing for this whole relationship thing. She keeps calling me, threatening to go to the boss with this thing, I could lose my job, I gotta do something to keep her quiet."
S03E12,JERRY,Elaine is in the bathroom. She's wise to whole red dot thing. She's asking me all kinds of questions.
S03E12,GEORGE,Did you tell her anything?
S03E12,JERRY,No.
S03E12,GEORGE,Do you swear?
S03E12,JERRY,I'm not swearing. I don't want to swear.
S03E12,GEORGE,Oh you told her didn't you.
S03E12,JERRY,No.
S03E12,ELAINE,"Hey George, did you buy that sweater knowing that red dot was on it because you could get it at a discount?"
S03E12,GEORGE,What? Did I what?
S03E12,ELAINE,You did didn't you.
S03E12,GEORGE,"Elaine, I'm, I'm shocked. I'm shocked. Here I go out in the spirit of the season (Elaine looking like she's not buying a word of it) and spend all my savings to buy you the most beautiful Christmas sweater I have ever seen to show my appreciation to you at Christmas and this is the thanks that I get at Christmas."
S03E12,ELAINE,Well Jerry told me that you did.
S03E12,GEORGE,You told her? How could you tell her? I told you not to say anything.
S03E12,JERRY,I didn't tell her you stupid idiot. She tricked you.
S03E12,GEORGE,"Elaine you don't understand. I had 103 temperature when I bought that sweater. I was so dizzy I was seeing red dots everywhere. I thought everything in the store had a red dot on it. I couldn't distinguish one red dot from another. I couldn't afford anything. I have nothing. I haven't worked for a really long time. (Jerry is standing right behind George. Jerry takes out a hankerchief and starts fake-crying in it.) I mean look, I have no clothes, look at what I'm wearing. It's just a little red dot."
S03E12,GEORGE,This is for you.
S03E12,CLEANING WOMAN,"Oh, Georgie, you bought this for me? Oh I knew you cared for me."
S03E12,GEORGE,"As you care for me. Which is why it is very important that you never breathe a word of this to anyone about the... you know. What, with Clarence Thomas and everything."
S03E12,CLEANING WOMAN,"Okay, okay, can I open it now?"
S03E12,GEORGE,Yes of course go ahead. My guess is you're going to like this very much.
S03E12,CLEANING WOMAN,Oh! Is that cashmere?
S03E12,GEORGE,Of course it's cashemere.
S03E12,CLEANING WOMAN,A cashmere sweater. Oh Georgie Porgie!
S03E12,GEORGE,Just a little something for Christmas.
S03E12,CLEANING WOMAN,"When I was a little girl in Panama, a rich American came to our town and he was wearing the softest most beautiful sweater. I said to him, ""what do you call this most beautiful fabric?"", and he said ""they call it cashmere"". I repeated the words ""cashmere, cashmere"". I asked if I could have it, and he said ""No. Get away from me."" Then he started walk away. But I grabbed onto his leg screaming for him to give me the sweater and he dragged me through the street. And then he kicked at me with the other foot and threw some change at me. Oh, but I didn't want the change Georgie. I wanted the cashmere."
S03E12,GEORGE,"I had a feeling you would like it. No, don't try it on now, try it on later."
S03E12,CLEANING WOMAN,"Wow, look at this. It feels so beautiful."
S03E12,GEORGE,Take it off. You're going to ruin it.
S03E12,CLEANING WOMAN,(noticing the dot) What's this?
S03E12,JERRY,"I was in the men's room the other day and they had the hand blower, instead of the paper towels, you know this thing. I like the hand blower I have to say. It takes a little bit longer, but I feel when you're in a room with a revolting stench you want to spend as much time as you can."
S03E12,DICK,The only stench is comming from you.
S03E12,AUDIENCE,Oooooh.
S03E12,JERRY,"Oh, wait a second, I believe we have a heckler ladies and gentlemen. Hey Dick I don't know what your problem is. It's not my fault you're back on the wagon."
S03E12,DICK,It's off the wagon.
S03E12,JERRY,In the old days how do you think they got the alcohol from town to town?
S03E12,DICK,I don't know.
S03E12,JERRY,On the wagon. Don't you think they broke into a couple of those bottles along the way?
S03E12,DICK,You can't drink on a wagon it would be too bumpy.
S03E12,JERRY,They had smooth trails. What about the Cumberland Gap?
S03E12,DICK,What the hell do you know about wagons?
S03E12,JERRY,I know enough not to get on them.
S03E12,MR. LIPPMAN,I'm going to get right to the point. It has come to my attention that you and the cleaning woman have engaged in sexual intercourse on the desk in your office. Is that correct?
S03E12,GEORGE,Who said that?
S03E12,MR. LIPPMAN,She did.
S03E12,GEORGE,"Was that wrong? Should I have not done that? I tell you I gotta plead ignorance on this thing because if anyone had said anything to me at all when I first started here that that sort of thing was frouned upon, you know, cause I've worked in a lot of offices and I tell you peope do that all the time."
S03E12,MR. LIPPMAN,You're fired.
S03E12,GEORGE,Well you didn't have to say it like that.
S03E12,MR. LIPPMAN,I want you out of here by the end of the day.
S03E12,GEORGE,What about the whole Christmas spirit thing? Any flexability there?
S03E12,MR. LIPPMAN,"Nah. Wait, wait, she wanted me to give you this."
S03E12,ELAINE,You had sex on your desk with the cleaning woman.
S03E12,GEORGE,You never had sex in the office before?
S03E12,ELAINE,No. I once made out with someone but that was it.
S03E12,GEORGE,Alright so you made out with someone.
S03E12,ELAINE,Well that's not sex.
S03E12,GEORGE,Kissing is sex.
S03E12,ELAINE,Kissing is not sex.
S03E12,JERRY,George?
S03E12,GEORGE,Jerry.
S03E12,ELAINE,"Hey, did Jerry leave that drink next to Dick's on purpose?"
S03E12,GEORGE,No.
S03E12,JERRY,George?
S03E12,GEORGE,Over here.
S03E12,ELAINE,What are you doing here?
S03E12,JERRY,I'm taking the kid out to dinner to chear him up.
S03E12,ELAINE,Hey Jerry when do you consider that sex has taken place?
S03E12,JERRY,I would say when the nipple makes its first appearance.
S03E12,ELAINE,"So, George told me that you left the drink next to Dick's on purpose."
S03E12,JERRY,Nice try. So guess who heckled me at the club last night.
S03E12,DICK,Merry Christmas.
S03E12,ELAINE,Oh my god that's Dick. It's Cape Fear.
S03E12,GEORGE,"Hide, hide under the desk."
S03E12,ELAINE,"Ow, ow move over."
S03E12,JERRY,Get off of me.
S03E12,ELAINE,I've got no room.
S03E12,DICK,Is that cashmere?
S03E12,GEORGE,Of course it's cashmere.
S03E12,DICK,(noticing the dot) What's this?
S03E12,JERRY,"But in a way, I think I inadvertantly turned this guy into an alcoholic. I hate being around alcoholics because they're either telling you how much they love you or how much they hate you. And those are the two statements that scare me the most. But I think he's okay now because I have no idea how he feels about me. He's finally off the wagon."
S03E12,DICK,You mean on the wagon.
S03E12,JERRY,Don't get smart.
S03E13,KRAMER,"All right, Coney Island. Ok, you can take the B or the F and switch for the N at Broadway Lafayette, or you can go over the bridge to DeKalb and catch the Q to Atlantic Avenue, then switch to the IRT 2, 3, 4 or 5, but don't get on the G. See that's very tempting, but you wind up on Smith and 9th street, then you got to get on the R."
S03E13,ELAINE,Couldn't he just take the D straight to Coney Island?
S03E13,KRAMER,"Well, yeah..."
S03E13,ELAINE,"Ok, what time is your job interview George?"
S03E13,GEORGE,945
S03E13,JERRY,"Remember, don't whistle on the elevator."
S03E13,GEORGE,Why not?
S03E13,JERRY,"That's what Willie Loman told Biff before his interview, in 'Death of a salesman'."
S03E13,GEORGE,"What, you are comparing me to Biff Loman, very encouraging. The biggest loser in history of American literature."
S03E13,ELAINE,"All right, I'm gonna go."
S03E13,JERRY,What time is the lesbian wedding?
S03E13,ELAINE,930
S03E13,GEORGE,"Lesbian wedding. How do they work bride and groom out, what do they flip a coin?"
S03E13,ELAINE,"Yeah, they flip a coin."
S03E13,GEORGE,"What, was that not politically correct? It's a legitimate question."
S03E13,JERRY,I'm so tired. I'll fall asleep on that train (yawns)
S03E13,GEORGE,"I get the feeling when lesbians are looking at me, they're thinking ""That's why I'm not heterosexual""."
S03E13,KRAMER,"Jerry, come on let's go, pick up the check so we can go."
S03E13,JERRY,"Oh, I'm paying for breakfast?"
S03E13,KRAMER,Yeah.
S03E13,ELAINE,Yeah.
S03E13,GEORGE,Yeah.
S03E13,JERRY,Why do I always pay? What am I made of money? You bunch of deadbeats.
S03E13,GEORGE,How many tickets are you paying today?
S03E13,KRAMER,"Well, let's see speeding, running a red light, no license, no registration, no plates, no brake lights, no rear view mirror...yeah. (gives George a ticket)"
S03E13,GEORGE,No doors?
S03E13,KRAMER,"I'm fighting that one. You know, this is gonna cost me over six hundred bucks."
S03E13,GEORGE,"I can't carry any changes in these pants, it falls out."
S03E13,VIOLIN PLAYER,Thank you.
S03E13,GEORGE,That guy is not blind.
S03E13,JERRY,"So, can I convince anybody to come down to Coney Island with me? I got to pick up my car at the pound. George?"
S03E13,GEORGE,I can't believe they actually found your stolen car.
S03E13,JERRY,Not only that they found it. It was simonized and the front end was aligned.
S03E13,GEORGE,That's amazing.
S03E13,JERRY,So what do you say? Run in the cyclone. Hotdogs on Nathan's is on me.
S03E13,GEORGE,What are you? Satan? I'm close to a job here. It's my second interview with them.
S03E13,JERRY,"All right, biff. Elaine, merry-go-round?"
S03E13,ELAINE,I can't. I'm the best man.
S03E13,JERRY,"Kramer, bumper-cars?"
S03E13,KRAMER,"I've gotta go to court, I'll get in trouble. What's the matter with you?"
S03E13,JERRY,Could be years before I get back to Coney Island. I can't go to rides alone.
S03E13,SUBWAY ANNOUNCEMENT,"42th street. Change to D,N,RR,2,3,4,5,7,C,E,F train."
S03E13,ELAINE,See'ya.
S03E13,WOMAN,You looking for a job?
S03E13,GEORGE,"Me, why?"
S03E13,WOMAN,"Well, you're reading the classifieds."
S03E13,GEORGE,"Oh, no no no. I was just looking for stock-pages. Here it is. Looking for the quotes. Gotta check to quotes. Love a good quote. Oh, IBM up a quarter."
S03E13,WOMAN,You didn't look like someone who needed a job.
S03E13,GEORGE,"Me? No, no, I don't, I don't. Doing very well, very well, yep."
S03E13,WOMAN,"So, you're in 'the market'?"
S03E13,GEORGE,"Yeah I'm, eh, in 'the market'."
S03E13,WOMAN,Which market?
S03E13,GEORGE,"Which market, the, eh, big one, the big market, the big board. Bull market, bear market, you name the market, I'm there."
S03E13,WOMAN,"So, do you work for one of those big broker-houses?"
S03E13,GEORGE,They wish. I hate the big broker-houses. Hate them with a passion. Big broker-houses killed my father.
S03E13,WOMAN,Really?
S03E13,GEORGE,"Well, they hurt him bad. Really hurt his feelings. It's a long story. I- I don't like to talk about it, but I swore then that I would never work for big broker-houses. See, all they care about is money. I'm about more than money, I'm about people, always gone my own way and I've never looked back."
S03E13,WOMAN,I started riding these trains in the forties. Those days a man would give up their seat for a woman. Now we're liberated and we have to stand.
S03E13,ELAINE,It's ironic.
S03E13,Women,What's ironic?
S03E13,ELAINE,"This, that we've come all this way, we have made all this progress, but you know we've lost the little things, the niceties."
S03E13,WOMAN,"No, I mean what does 'ironic' mean?"
S03E13,ELAINE,Oh...
S03E13,WOMAN,"Where are you up to, with such a nice present, birthday party?"
S03E13,ELAINE,A wedding.
S03E13,Women,A wedding?
S03E13,ELAINE,Yeah
S03E13,WOMAN,"Hah, I didn't know people still get married. It's hard today with men and women."
S03E13,ELAINE,You're telling me.
S03E13,WOMAN,"So, are they a nice couple?"
S03E13,ELAINE,"Oh, very nice."
S03E13,WOMAN,"What does he do, if you don't mind me asking?"
S03E13,ELAINE,She.
S03E13,Women,"She? She works, he doesn't. He sounds like my son."
S03E13,ELAINE,There is no he.
S03E13,Women,"There is no he. So, who's getting married?"
S03E13,ELAINE,"Em, two women. It's, eh...lesbian wedding."
S03E13,Women,Lesbian wedding.
S03E13,ELAINE,"Aha, yep. I'm the...eh...bes tman."
S03E13,Women (talks to man next to her),My luck. I don't talk to a soul in the subway for 35 years. I get a best man at a lesbian wedding. (leaves)
S03E13,ELAINE,"No, no, no, you don't understand! I'm not a lesbian! I hate men, but I'm not a lesbian!"
S03E13,ELAINE'S VOICE,"I'm really looking forward to this. I love weddings. Maybe I'll meet somebody, umm maybe not."
S03E13,ELAINE'S VOICE,"Oh, man. We're stopping?"
S03E13,WOMAN,"Well, this is where I get off."
S03E13,GEORGE,"Oh, you do?"
S03E13,WOMAN,"Eh, hey why don't you...oh nothing."
S03E13,GEORGE,"No, no, what, what?"
S03E13,WOMAN,"Well, I was going to say why don't you get off with me, but you're obviously very busy on your way to some important meeting or something."
S03E13,GEORGE,"Yeah, well...."
S03E13,WOMAN,Yeah I knew it was a bad idea.
S03E13,GEORGE,"Hey, what's another million, give or take. I get off where and when I wanna get off."
S03E13,GEORGE,"I'm stuck. Pull a little, just a second. Don't start the train! Don't start the train!!"
S03E13,MAN1,"This, it's the fourth horse of the first race, Pappanick."
S03E13,MAN2,How do you know it's going to win?
S03E13,MAN1,"My UPS-guy tells. Guys who own the horses are regular customers. Every horse he has ever given me has won. See, they've been sandbagging and looking for a good spot. He's been getting it light cause they've been using bug boy and the workout hasn't been published. Now they are ready to run with it. They are gonna break his maiden. It's going to go to great price, maybe 301. I'm telling you, it's a lock."
S03E13,MAN2,But it rained last night.
S03E13,MAN1,"Exactly, this horse loves the slop. It's in his bloodlines. His father was a mudda', his mother was a mudda'."
S03E13,MAN2,His mudda' was a mudda'?
S03E13,MAN1,"What did I just say? Come on, let's go to the office, I'm going to call my bookie. (looks around to see if anyone is listening) Hey, don't tell anybody."
S03E13,JERRY,"O-K. You realize of course, you're naked?"
S03E13,NAKED MAN,"Naked, dressed. I don't see any difference."
S03E13,JERRY,You oughta' sit here. There is a difference.
S03E13,NAKED MAN,You got something against naked body?
S03E13,JERRY,"I got something against yours. How about a couple of deep knee bends, maybe a squat thrust?"
S03E13,NAKED MAN,Who's got time for squat thrusts?
S03E13,JERRY,"All right, how about skipping breakfast. I'm guessing you're not a 'half-grapefruit and black coffee' guy."
S03E13,NAKED MAN,I like a good breakfast.
S03E13,JERRY,"I understand, I like good breakfast. Long as you don't wind up trapped in a room with bib overalls and pigtails, been counseled by Dick Gregory."
S03E13,NAKED MAN,I'm not ashamed of my body.
S03E13,JERRY,"That's your problem, you should be."
S03E13,JERRY,"Don't get up, please, allow me."
S03E13,ELAINE'S VOICE,"Oh, this is great. This is what I need, just what I need. Ok, take it easy I'm sure it's nothing. Probably rats on the track, we're stopping for rats. God, it's so crowded. How can there be so many people? This guy really smells, doesn't anyone use deodorant in the city? What is so hard, you take the cap off, you roll it on. What's that? I feel something rubbing against me. Disgusting animals, these people should be in a gage. We are in a gage. What if I miss the wedding? I got the ring. What'll they do? You can't get married without the ring. Oh, I can't breath, I feel faint. Take it easy, it'll start moving soon. Think about the people on the concentration camps, what they went through. And hostages, what would you do if you were a hostage? Think about that. This is nothing. No, it's not nothing, it's something. It's a nightmare! Help me! Move it! Com'on move this fu(beep) thing!! Why isn't it moving?!? What can go wrong with a train!?! It's on tracks, there's no traffic! How can a train get stuck. Step on the gas!! What could it be? You'de think the conductor would explain it to us? 'I'm sorry there's a delay we'll be moving in 5 minutes'!! I wanna hear a voice. What's that on my leg?!!"
S03E13,GEORGE,"Are you often on business trip? Nice...oh, hey nice ice-bucket."
S03E13,WOMAN,Make your-self comfortable.
S03E13,GEORGE'S VOICE,"Make myself comfortable. What does that mean? Does she want me to take my clothes off? Is she taking her clothes off? What if I take my clothes off and she still has hers' on? Then I really look like an idiot. She could get offended and leave. So maybe I should leave them on, but what then if she takes her off? Then she'll feel humiliated. 'Make yourself comfortable'. I got this unbelievable woman and this 'comfortable'-thing can ruin me. I got it! I take my shoes off and sit on the bed. There, that's comfortable. She can't accuse me being unconvertible."
S03E13,GEORGE,Gotta tell you I'm pretty comfortable.
S03E13,KRAMER,"Oh yeah, it's all set. They got the bug boy on him."
S03E13,GUY,The bug boy.
S03E13,KRAMER,"Yeah, the little father has run his hard out. They're gonna break his maiden."
S03E13,GUY,"Really? But, it's a little bit slow out there it rained last night."
S03E13,KRAMER,"Oh, this baby loves the slob, loves it, eats it up. Eats the slob. Born in the slob. His father was a mudda'."
S03E13,GUY,His father was a mudda'?
S03E13,KRAMER,His mudda' was a mudda'.
S03E13,GUY,His mudda' was a mudda'?
S03E13,KRAMER,What did I just say?
S03E13,KRAMER,"Hey, all right, 600 Pappanick to win."
S03E13,NAKED MAN,They still have no pitching. Goodin's a question mahk. ...You don't recover from those rotator cuffs so fast.
S03E13,JERRY,I'm not worried about their best pitching. They got pitching. ...They got no hitting.
S03E13,NAKED MAN,"No hitting? They got hitting! Bonilla, Murry. ...They got no defence."
S03E13,JERRY,Defence? Please. ...They need speed.
S03E13,NAKED MAN,Speed? They got Coleman. ...They need a bullpen.
S03E13,JERRY,Franco's no good? ...They got no team leaders.
S03E13,NAKED MAN,They got Franco! ...What they need is a front office.
S03E13,JERRY,But you gotta like their chances.
S03E13,NAKED MAN,I LUV their chances.
S03E13,JERRY,Tell you what. If they win the penant I'll sit naked with you at the World Series.
S03E13,NAKED MAN,It's a deal!
S03E13,ELAINE'S VOICE,"Why couldn't I take a cab. For 6 dollars my whole life could've changed. What is that on my leg? I'll never get out of here. What if I'm here for the rest of my life? Maybe I'll get out in 5 seconds. 1 banana, 2 banana, 3 banana, 4 banana, 5 banana...no, I'm still here! Still here! Why don't they start moving? Move! Move!! Move!!! *Train starts moving, lights get back on* It's moving! It's moving! Yes! Yes!! *Train stops again and lights go off* Motherf(beep-beep)!!!"
S03E13,GEORGE,"Eh, gee, I hope you have the key for these things."
S03E13,WOMAN,"Oh, don't worry. I do."
S03E13,GEORGE,"You know, my mother used to walk around on our apartment just in her bra and panties. She didn't look anything like you, she was really disgusting, really bad body. If you could imagine uglier and fatter version of Shirley Booth. Remember Shirley Booth from Hazel. Really embarrassing, cause you know I had only mother in the whole neighborhood who was worse looking than Hazel. Imagine the taunts I would hear."
S03E13,WOMAN,Like what?
S03E13,GEORGE,"Like a ""Hey your mother is uglier than Hazel. Hazel really puts your mother to shame"""
S03E13,GEORGE,What's going on?
S03E13,WOMAN,"It was a pleasure doing business with you George, but I'm afraid I have to get going."
S03E13,GEORGE,"Get going? But we haven't really, you know...."
S03E13,WOMAN,Eight dollars? Eight dollars?
S03E13,GEORGE,What are you doing? You're robbing me?
S03E13,WOMAN,I wasted my whole morning with you for eight dollars?
S03E13,GEORGE,"Wait, wait a second, what are you doing?"
S03E13,WOMAN,I'm taking your clothes.
S03E13,GEORGE,"No, that's my only suit. It cost me 350 dollars. I got it at Moe Ginsburg."
S03E13,WOMAN,Bye George.
S03E13,GEORGE,"No wait, you can't just leave me here! Will I see you again?"
S03E13,(The race is on and Pappanick is slowly making ground. Kramer is pounding himself imitating the jockey and shouts,"Yes, yes, yes... The winner is Pappanick)"
S03E13,KRAMER,"Yes! Yes! I won, hey (shouts to cashier)"
S03E13,NAKED MAN,I haven't had a hotdog at Nathan's for 20 years.
S03E13,JERRY,First we ride the cyclone.
S03E13,NAKED MAN,Chilly out.
S03E13,JERRY,"Aah, French fries."
S03E13,THUG,Give me the money. Give me the money!
S03E13,BLIND VIOLIN PLAYER,"(puts a gun to the thug's head) Freeze, Police!"
S03E13,JERRY,"No, I never got the car. We were having such a good time, by the time I got to the police garage, it was closed."
S03E13,ELAINE,Too bad.
S03E13,JERRY,You wouldn't believe what this guy put away at Nathan's. Look at what we won!
S03E13,JERRY,You want him?
S03E13,ELAINE,Get that out of my face.
S03E13,JERRY,"So, you missed the wedding. You'll catch the bris!"
S03E13,MAN AT THE COUNTER,"(yelling) Hare Krishna, Hare Krishna!"
S03E13,GEORGE,"How would you like a 'Hare Krishna' fist on your throat, you little punk?"
S03E13,ELAINE,George?
S03E13,JERRY,"Biff, what did you whistle on the elevator?"
S03E13,GEORGE,"You have my spare-key in your apartment, right?"
S03E13,JERRY,"Yeah, it's in the kitchen drawer."
S03E13,GEORGE,"Give me your key, I gotta get it."
S03E13,KRAMER,What happened?
S03E13,GEORGE,"Never mind what happened, just give me the key."
S03E13,JERRY,"Come on, I'll go with you."
S03E13,ELAINE,"Here, pay. (Gives the check to Jerry)"
S03E13,KRAMER,"Wait, wait, wait..."
S03E14,GEORGE,...pianist. A *classical* pianist. She *plays* the piano. She's a *brilliant* woman. I-I-I sat in her living room... She played the *Waldstein Sonata*! The *Waldstein*!
S03E14,GEORGE,"We did a crossword puzzle together, *in bed*. It was the most fun I ever had in my entire life. Did you hear me? in my *life*! Y'know?"
S03E14,JERRY,Were you talking? I couldn't hear anything.
S03E14,GEORGE,I was telling you about Noel.
S03E14,JERRY,"Oh, Noel! Yeah, the one who plays bongos..."
S03E14,GEORGE,[sarcastically] Heh heh heh... So side-splittingly funny...
S03E14,JERRY,"All right, I'm sorry. What about her?"
S03E14,GEORGE,"What, you think I'm going to repeat the whole thing now?"
S03E14,JERRY,"I know, you told me you like her, everything is going good."
S03E14,GEORGE,"No everything is *not* going good. I'm very uncomfortable. I have no power. I mean, why should she have the upper hand. *Once* in my life I would like the upper hand. I have no hand-- no hand at all. She has the hand; I have *no* hand..."
S03E14,GEORGE,How do I get the hand?
S03E14,JERRY,We all want the hand. Hand is tough to get. You gotta get the hand right from the opening.
S03E14,GEORGE,"She's playing a recital this week at the McBierney School. You wanna hear her play? I got two extra tickets, you and Elaine could go..."
S03E14,JERRY,"Yeah, that sounds like somethin'..."
S03E14,GEORGE,"Then afterwards maybe we could all go out together. Y'know she'll see me with my friends, she'll observe me as I really am, as myself. Maybe I can get some hand that way."
S03E14,KRAMER,"Hey, smell my arm... Smell it!"
S03E14,GEORGE,"With all due respect, I don't think so..."
S03E14,JERRY,"That smells good, what is that?"
S03E14,KRAMER,The *beach*!
S03E14,JERRY,The *beach*?
S03E14,GEORGE,"What, did you go swimmin'? It's 29 degrees out!"
S03E14,KRAMER,I just joined the Polar Bear Club.
S03E14,JERRY,You joined the *Polar Bears*?!
S03E14,GEORGE,"What the Hell is a ""Polar Bear""?"
S03E14,KRAMER,"Well, it's these people-- they go swimmin' in the winter. They're terrific, I just took my first swim today. Brrrrrrr! It's invigorating...."
S03E14,JERRY,Yeah... So's shock therapy.
S03E14,JERRY,"[with glee] What is that, a Pez dispenser?!"
S03E14,KRAMER,"Want one? Yeah, I just bought it at the Flea Market."
S03E14,GEORGE,"Hey, what goes on there, exactly?"
S03E14,JERRY,You don't know?
S03E14,GEORGE,"No, I-I-I know... [retreats back to his Chinese take out] I know..."
S03E14,JERRY,"You think they have fleas there, don't you?"
S03E14,GEORGE,*No*...
S03E14,JERRY,"Yes you do, Biff. You've never been to a Flea Market, and you think they have fleas there."
S03E14,GEORGE,"All right, I think they have fleas there. So what..."
S03E14,ELAINE,I don't know how anyone does this. It must be *so* nerve racking... How do they warm up their fingers?
S03E14,JERRY,They have a piano backstage they warm up on.
S03E14,ELAINE,"*No*, we would have heard it."
S03E14,JERRY,"What, do you think they just crack their knuckles and come out?"
S03E14,GEORGE,"I told her we'd all go out afterwards, okay? And don't applaud when she stops playing the first time. It's not over yet."
S03E14,JERRY,"[quickly whispering] I resent that you said that! That's directed at *me*, isn't it?!"
S03E14,JERRY,Is this okay? Can I do this? (he claps)
S03E14,STEVE,Something I said? [no response] It's John... Mollika.
S03E14,ELAINE,"Oh, oh, *John*... Oh, hi John... Hi..."
S03E14,STEVE,What're you doing down here?
S03E14,ELAINE,"Oh, I was just at this recital and Jerry put a Pez dispenser on my leg and I started laughing."
S03E14,MOLLIKA,Jerry's in there? I heard you guys broke up.
S03E14,ELAINE,We did. We're just hanging out.
S03E14,MOLLIKA,REally. ... You really look great.
S03E14,ELAINE,"Oh, uh, thank you. Are you still friends with Richie Appel?"
S03E14,MOLLIKA,"Oh, Richie, he's been doing comedy in L. A. for a few years. He just got back a month ago. He's kind of messed up. On drugs. I don't know what to do for the guy."
S03E14,ELAINE,Have you thought about an intervention?
S03E14,MOLLIKA,What's that?
S03E14,ELAINE,"You get all his friends in a room, They confront himm to try to get him into rehab. It's a very popular thing now."
S03E14,MOLLIKA,He'd never listen to anyone. ... Except of course Jerry. He'd listen to Jerry. Jerry would have to be involved. He really respects Jerry.
S03E14,ElainELAINE,"I'm sorry. George, I'm sorry!"
S03E14,GEORGE,What did you put the Pez dispenser on her leg for in the first place?
S03E14,JERRY,"I dunno, it was an impulse."
S03E14,GEORGE,What kind of a sick impulse does that??
S03E14,JERRY,How could I know she would start to laugh?
S03E14,ELAINE,I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I *am*!
S03E14,JERRY,Can we just go in already?
S03E14,GEORGE,What are we gonna tell her?
S03E14,ELAINE,I'll tell her I was the one who laughed.
S03E14,GEORGE,"No, don't say a word. If she thinks my friends are jerks, then I'm a *jerk*..."
S03E14,ELAINE,"[To Jerry] Oh, remind me to talk to you about something later."
S03E14,JERRY,What about?
S03E14,GEORGE,"Hey, hey! We're discussing something!"
S03E14,JERRY,"I know, but I'm distracted now."
S03E14,GEORGE,What are you? A *baby*!? All right. Tell her.
S03E14,ELAINE,When I was outside I ran into John Mollika.
S03E14,JERRY,"Really John Mollika, they guy that used to bartend at the Comedy Club. How's he doing?"
S03E14,ELAINE,He's good.
S03E14,GEORGE,"Uh, can we cut to the chase?"
S03E14,JERRY,"""Cut to the chase""?"
S03E14,GEORGE,Yeah...
S03E14,JERRY,"What're you, ""Joe Hollywood""?"
S03E14,GEORGE,A lot of people say it.
S03E14,JERRY,I would lose that.
S03E14,GEORGE,[Accusingly] What's *that*?
S03E14,JERRY,"""Lose that""? That's not a Hollywood expression!"
S03E14,GEORGE,[Realizing full well it isn't] ...Yes it is.
S03E14,ELAINE,Anyway ... So John told me that Richie is in town from Los Angeles and he's really messed up on drugs. So I told him that he should do an intervention.
S03E14,JERRY,"Really, an intervention ..."
S03E14,GEORGE,"Y'know people, we got a situation over here!"
S03E14,ELAINE,"Yeah, but he want's you to be a part of it."
S03E14,JERRY,Me? Why me?
S03E14,ELAINE,'Cause Richie really respects you and he would listen to you.
S03E14,JERRY,Y'know these things are *really* hard to load...
S03E14,GEORGE,"All right, OK, I'm goin' in."
S03E14,JERRY,We've got to talk about this (to Elaine)
S03E14,ELAINE,All right.
S03E14,GEORGE,"Hi, hi, hi, You were wonderful."
S03E14,NOEL,No..
S03E14,GEORGE,"Oh, these are my friends, Elaine and Jerry, ... Noel"
S03E14,JERRY,You play a *Hell* of a piano.
S03E14,ELAINE,"Yeah, I was really moved, *really* moved."
S03E14,NOEL,Well didn't you hear that person laughing? I couldn't play. I was *humiliated...
S03E14,ELAINE,"Well, I'm sure it wasn't *at* you."
S03E14,NOEL,"Well then, what was she laughing at?"
S03E14,JERRY,Pez?
S03E14,NOEL,"Uh, no, No thank you. Did you see her?"
S03E14,GEORGE,"Me, uh, uh, no, ..."
S03E14,JERRY,Anyone who would laugh at a recital is probably some sort of lunatic anyway. I mean only a sick twisted mind could be that rude and ignorant.
S03E14,ELAINE,Maybe some mental defective put something stupid on her leg.
S03E14,JERRY,Even if this so called mental defective did put something on her leg she's still the one who laughed.
S03E14,NOEL,I'll never forget that laugh for the rest of my life. [exits]
S03E14,ELAINE,I'm sure she would apologize if she could. Probably somebody is holding her back against every fibre in her being.
S03E14,GEORGE,If she want's to continue to have a fibre of her being she'll be very careful (hitting each other)
S03E14,GEORGE,"All right, so are you ready, so we'll go out and get something to eat."
S03E14,NOEL,I don't feel like it tonight.
S03E14,JERRY,We'll be outside
S03E14,ELAINE,Yeah
S03E14,JERRY,"It was nice meeting you By the way, How do you warm up your fingers before you play?"
S03E14,NOEL,I just crack my knuckles.
S03E14,GEORGE,We'll have a good time
S03E14,NOEL,I don't feel like it
S03E14,GEORGE,"Ah, come on"
S03E14,NOEL,I said I DON'T FEEL LIKE IT!
S03E14,GEORGE,"Um, all right, um, uh, I'll call 'ya. I'll call you and we'll talk on the phone. A telephone communiqu. Every thing is fine ok, uh, fine, .. [exits]"
S03E14,JERRY,You know I thing Kramer might have been responsible for getting Richie involved with drugs in the first place.
S03E14,ELAINE,What? How?
S03E14,JERRY,A few years ago the comedy club had a softball team. Kramer was our first baseman You couldn't get anything by him It was unbelievable. Anyway this one game we came back to win from like 8 runs behind. So Kramer says to Richie why don't you dump the bucket of Gatorade on Marty Benson's head? The club owner. So Richie goes ahead and does it.
S03E14,ELAINE,So? What happened?
S03E14,JERRY,"What happened? The guy was like 67 years old, it was freezing out, he caught a cold, got pneumonia, and a month later he was dead."
S03E14,ELAINE,Shut up!
S03E14,JERRY,All the comedians were happy. He was one of these club owners nobodu liked anyway. But Richie was never the same.
S03E14,ELAINE,Whar about Kramer?
S03E14,JERRY,He's the same!
S03E14,JERRY,"Are you sure you want me John. I have spoken to Richie in two years. I don't have a good apartment for an intervention. The furniture, it's very non-confrontational. All right All right. Goodbye. [to Kramer] Remember Ricie Appel?"
S03E14,KRAMER,"(looks shocked) Oh sure, the guy I told to pour the Gatorade that killed Marty Benson?"
S03E14,JERRY,"Right, we'll John Mollika is organizing some kind of intervention for him. We're having it here."
S03E14,KRAMER,Can I get in on that?
S03E14,JERRY,What do you think? It's like a poker game?
S03E14,KRAMER,Is Elaine going?
S03E14,JERRY,Yeah
S03E14,KRAMER,"Well, I knew him as well as she did."
S03E14,JERRY,"Yeah, but John invited her."
S03E14,KRAMER,"So what are you saying, you don't want me to intervene?"
S03E14,JERRY,"No, intervene, go intervene all you want. I am just afraid you might be interfering while we're intervening."
S03E14,GEORGE,It's George
S03E14,JERRY,Stop smelling your arm.
S03E14,KRAMER,You know I got a great idea for a cologne. The Beach. You spray it on and you smell like you just came home from the beach
S03E14,JERRY,"Hum, a cologne that smells like the beach. I can't believe I'm saying this, ""That's not a bad idea."""
S03E14,KRAMER,Tell me about it!
S03E14,JERRY,"Why don't you call Steve D'Jiff, he works in the marketing department at Calvin Klein. In fact he's a good friend of John Mollika and Richie also."
S03E14,GEORGE,Well it's over. It's definitely over.
S03E14,JERRY,She broke up with you?
S03E14,GEORGE,"No, but I can tell she's going to. I can sense it. We had this terrible phone conversation. I was so nervous before I called I made up this whole list of things to talk about."
S03E14,JERRY,What was on the list?
S03E14,GEORGE,"Let's see, How I'm very good at going in reverse in my car, why isn't Postum a more popular drink,"
S03E14,JERRY,"Yeah, Postum is under-ratted,"
S03E14,GEORGE,"Anyway there was all this tension. I asked her if she wanted to go out to dinner and she said ""no, maybe we could get together for lunch."" You know what that means."
S03E14,JERRY,What's wrong with lunch?
S03E14,GEORGE,Lunch is fine at the beginning then you move on to dinner. you don't move back to lunch. It's like being demoted. I'll never do another crossword puzzle with her again. I know it.
S03E14,KRAMER,I like the Jumble You ever do the Jumble?
S03E14,GEORGE,I have no power Do you understand? I need hand. I have no hand.
S03E14,KRAMER,Break up with her
S03E14,GEORGE,What?
S03E14,KRAMER,You break up with her. You reverse everything that way.
S03E14,JERRY,A preemptive breakup.
S03E14,GEORGE,A preemptive breakup. This is an incredible idea. I got nothing to lose. We either break up which she would do anyway but at least I go out with some Dignity. Completely turn the tables. It's absolutely brilliant.
S03E14,GEORGE,"So, I am have to going to break up with you."
S03E14,NOEL,You're breaking up with me?
S03E14,GEORGE,"I, ... am breaking up with, ... you."
S03E14,NOEL,Wow.
S03E14,GEORGE,Shocked?
S03E14,NOEL,I really am.
S03E14,GEORGE,Never expected this did you?
S03E14,NOEL,I thought everything was fine.
S03E14,GEORGE,"Well, live and learn."
S03E14,NOEL,I don't understand. You're breaking up with me. Didn't we have fun doing the crossword puzzles?
S03E14,GEORGE,Kind of.
S03E14,NOEL,I'm very confused.
S03E14,GEORGE,"Well, I didn't mean to hurt you kid."
S03E14,NOEL,"I thought,..."
S03E14,GEORGE,"Now, stop it ..."
S03E14,NOEL,"What do you want, I can make you happy."
S03E14,GEORGE,When you're playing the piano do you think about me?
S03E14,NOEL,I don't know.
S03E14,GEORGE,This is what I'm talking about.
S03E14,NOEL,"OK, I'll think about you."
S03E14,GEORGE,All the time.
S03E14,NOEL,"All the time? ... OK, All the time."
S03E14,GEORGE,I can't hear you.
S03E14,NOEL,All the time. ALL THE TIME.
S03E14,GEORGE,"See, It's not so hard."
S03E14,KRAMER,"Go ahead smell, smell"
S03E14,STEVE,"Yeah, so?"
S03E14,KRAMER,Do you recognize it? ... The beach.
S03E14,STEVE,What are you talking about?
S03E14,KRAMER,"Oh, I'm talking about the beach."
S03E14,STEVE,What about it?
S03E14,KRAMER,"You know the way you smell when you first come home from the beach? Well, I want to make a cologne that captures the essence of that smell. Oh yeah."
S03E14,STEVE,That is the dumbest idea I have ever heard.
S03E14,KRAMER,"Oh, wait, Did you here what I just said?"
S03E14,STEVE,Do you think people are going to pay $80 a bottle to smell like dead fish and sea weed? That's why people take showers when the come home from the beach. It's an objectionable offensive odour.
S03E14,KRAMER,So you don't think it's a good idea?
S03E14,[The Intervention [NOTE,DOUBLE CHECK THIS PART FOR SURE!!!!]
S03E14,GUY,The membranes get dried and it just starts bleeding. Since I was a kid so I have to stick tissue up there
S03E14,ELAINE,"(very uninterested) Uh, you have to work like that?"
S03E14,GUY,Nobody minds Nobody has ever said anything to me.
S03E14,OTHER GUY,Are there any ice cubes?
S03E14,JERRY,In the freezer.
S03E14,OTHER GUY,I looked. There aren't any ice cubes.
S03E14,JERRY,Well I guess there aren't any ice cubes.
S03E14,OTHER GUY,I can't drink this. It's warm! (walks away)
S03E14,GUY,Shouldn't we rehearse this a little bit before Richie comes?
S03E14,STEVE,What's the plan?
S03E14,JERRY,Do I have to talk? I don't feel like talking.
S03E14,OTHER GUY,"Well, if he's not going to talk I'm not going to talk either."
S03E14,GUY,"No, we all have to talk."
S03E14,ELAINE,What's the order?
S03E14,GUY,We'll go in alphabetical order. First Roberta.
S03E14,ROBERTA,Why am I first?
S03E14,ELAINE,Albano is your last name.
S03E14,ROBERTA,That's not my name any more. I'm divorced.
S03E14,STEVE,I'll go first.
S03E14,KRAMER,Hey.
S03E14,JERRY,Hey.
S03E14,KRAMER,Is this the interference?
S03E14,JERRY,Intervention.
S03E14,OTHER GUY,What are you doing here?
S03E14,KRAMER,"Uh, is it all right if I stay for the intervention?"
S03E14,STEVE,"Hey, this is for close friends only."
S03E14,KRAMER,I'm a friend. Who do you think told him to pour the Gatorade over Marty Benson's head?
S03E14,OTHER GUY,Let him stay.
S03E14,KRAMER,"Hey, you know I got someone to make up that cologne for me, big mouth."
S03E14,STEVE,Somebody's going to make that crap?
S03E14,OLD GUY,Kramer!
S03E14,KRAMER,"Hey, come on, these are some of my polar bear buddies."
S03E14,OTHER GUY,They can't stay.
S03E14,OLD GUY,We're having a party here?
S03E14,JERRY,"No, we're having an intervention"
S03E14,OLD GUY,An intervention? Who's intervening?
S03E14,JERRY,There's a friend of ours on drugs and we're going to confront him.
S03E14,OLD GUY,"Sure, we used to do that when one of our polar bears stopped coming. We would go to his house and say, ""What you don't want to be a polar bear anymore? It's too cold for you?"""
S03E14,GUY,It's him.
S03E14,ROBERTA,What should we do?
S03E14,ELAINE,Hide!
S03E14,JERRY,It's NOT a surprise party! Yeah (to intercom)
S03E14,GEORGE,It's George
S03E14,JERRY,"Yeah, come on up. ... It's not him."
S03E14,GUY,If you don't go out with me it's because I'm a bar tender.
S03E14,ELAINE,"Look, I don't think this is appropriate right now."
S03E14,GUY,Is it because I have a tissue in my nose?
S03E14,ELAINE,You're getting warm.
S03E14,GEORGE,We just came from Chadway's(?) What's going on.
S03E14,JERRY,We're having the intervention for Richie.
S03E14,GEORGE,"Oh, right, right, the intervention. Should we leave?"
S03E14,JERRY,"Well, uh.."
S03E14,NOEL,"(happily) Elaine, hi."
S03E14,ELAINE,"Oh, hi Noel"
S03E14,JERRY,"Well, you're looking well."
S03E14,GEORGE,"Jerry, let me tell you something, ""A man without hand is not a man."" I got so much hand I'm coming out of my gloves. I got to thank Kramer."
S03E14,STEVE,Even if I were dragged through manure I still wouldn't put that stuff on.
S03E14,GEORGE,(to Kramer) This man is a genius. Genius!
S03E14,STEVE,You think so?
S03E14,GEORGE,"I don't think so I know so, Kramer, come here I got to talk to you"
S03E14,OLD MAN,The male kangaroo doesn't have a pouch only the female has it. The male has pouch envy.
S03E14,ELAINE,(Chuckles)
S03E14,ELAINE,(laughs)
S03E14,NOEL,That laugh. That's the laugh. That's it. You're the one.
S03E14,ELAINE,"No, no. It was an accident. It really wasn't my fault. It was Jerry."
S03E14,NOEL,You put a Pez dispenser on her leg during my recital?.
S03E14,JERRY,I didn't know she would laugh.
S03E14,NOEL,"You lied to me George, you lied to me."
S03E14,GEORGE,"No, I, uh, um, wa, wa, What did I do? ... Where are you going?"
S03E14,NOEL,I ... am breaking up ... with you!
S03E14,GEORGE,You can't break up with me. I've got hand.
S03E14,NOEL,And you're going to need it.
S03E14,JERRY,Hey Richie
S03E14,RICHIE,So what's going on?
S03E14,JERRY,"It was pretty ugly from the get go. he's not listening, He's hostile, he's talking back."
S03E14,GEORGE,I can't do these puzzles.
S03E14,JERRY,So he starts to get up He spots the Pez dispenser on the coffee table
S03E14,GEORGE,Ah ah Pez dispenser.
S03E14,JERRY,"He picks it up - he stares at it - It's like he's hypnotized by it. Then he's telling us this story about how when he was a kid he was in the car with his father, and his father was trying to load one of them"
S03E14,GEORGE,Well they're hard to load.
S03E14,JERRY,Tell me something I don't know. So as the father's trying to load it he loses control of the car and it crashes into a high school cafeteria. Nobody's hurt but Pez is all over the car. And the dispenser was destroyed virtually beyond recognition.
S03E14,GEORGE,Poor kid.
S03E14,JERRY,So as he's telling the story he starts crying.
S03E14,GEORGE,What did you do?
S03E14,JERRY,What do you think? I gave him my Pez dispenser.
S03E14,GEORGE,Wow
S03E14,JERRY,Two hours later he checks into Smither's clinic. I talked to the doctor yesterday. He's doing great on the rehab. He's hooked on Pez. He's eating them like there's no tomorrow.
S03E14,GEORGE,What's a three letter word for candy?
S03E14,JERRY,I can't do those things.
S03E15,JERRY,Let me ask you a question. If you named a kid Rasputin do you think that would have a negative effect on his life?
S03E15,ELAINE,Na.
S03E15,JERRY,What are you doing? Were going out for dinner in ten minutes.
S03E15,ELAINE,Do you realize this is the last meal I am going to have for three days?
S03E15,JERRY,Yeah.
S03E15,GEORGE,Its George.
S03E15,JERRY,Come on up. . . . I never heard of this. Youve got to fast for three days to take an ulcer test. How you gonna do that?
S03E15,ELAINE,I dont know. How could I possibly have ulcers? Who could have given me ulcers?
S03E15,JERRY,I think Ill take out the garbage.
S03E15,ELAINE,"Hey, have you ever fasted?"
S03E15,JERRY,"Well, once I didnt have dinner until, like 900 oclock, that was pretty rough. (exits to hall with garbage  meets George) Hey, do me a favour will ya? Throw out my garbage for me."
S03E15,GEORGE,"Yeah, right."
S03E15,JERRY,"Come on, its just down the hall."
S03E15,GEORGE,Give me two bucks. Ill do it for two bucks.
S03E15,JERRY,Ill give you 50 cents.
S03E15,GEORGE,Theres no way I touch that bag for less than two dollars.
S03E15,JERRY,Come on. Fifty cents. (??) a piece of Drakes coffee cake
S03E15,GEORGE,"Youre not getting no Drakes Coffee Cake for fifty cents. Yae, Hey, Im all set. I got the ticket. Im going to the Cayman Islands this Friday."
S03E15,JERRY,I dont get you. Who goes on vacation without a job? What do you need a break from getting up at eleven?
S03E15,GEORGE,Its an incredible deal. I dont know why you dont come with me.
S03E15,JERRY,"Nah, I dont go for these non-refundable deals. I cant commit to a woman. Im not going to commit to an airline."
S03E15,GINA,Hi.
S03E15,JERRY,Hi.
S03E15,GINA,How are you?
S03E15,JERRY,"Gina, do you know what a Drakes Coffee Cake is?"
S03E15,GINA,"Of course, the plane cake with the sweet brown crumbs on the top."
S03E15,JERRY,How much do they cost?
S03E15,GINA,The junior?
S03E15,GEORGE,"No, no the full size."
S03E15,JERRY,"No, no the junior."
S03E15,GEORGE,"You didnt say ""junior""."
S03E15,GINA,I havent had one of those since I was a little girl.
S03E15,JERRY,Really? You should be ashamed of yourself. I want you out of here! (MARTIN enters the hall) How ya doing?
S03E15,MARTIN,Good enough.
S03E15,JERRY,Boy shes sexy isnt she?
S03E15,JERRY,Do you believe that guy?
S03E15,ELAINE,What guy?
S03E15,JERRY,My neighbour
S03E15,ELAINE,"Oh, that creepy guy?"
S03E15,JERRY,"Yeah, did he think I was flirting with her?"
S03E15,GEORGE,He didnt seem too pleased.
S03E15,ELAINE,Maybe Ill get a steak with french fried onion wings.
S03E15,GEORGE,"hey, you know what? I just remembered something. I had a dream about that guy last night. This is amazing."
S03E15,JERRY,Whats so amazing? Youve seen him before.
S03E15,GEORGE,I havent seen him for months.
S03E15,JERRY,What was the dream?
S03E15,GEORGE,I was doing standup comedy in Kennebunkport Maine. ??? night club. The stage was on a cliff and the audience was throwing all the comics off.
S03E15,JERRY,I think Ive played there.
S03E15,GEORGE,Ive had a lot of other paranormal stuff happen to me.
S03E15,JERRY,Youre a little paranormal
S03E15,ELAINE,"Hey, George, you know my friend goes to a psychic."
S03E15,GEORGE,Really?
S03E15,ELAINE,"Uh uh, you should go some time."
S03E15,GEORGE,Id love to go. Make an appointment.
S03E15,JERRY,"Psychics, vacations. How about getting a job?"
S03E15,GEORGE,I just got fired.
S03E15,JERRY,"Alright, come on, lets get out of here."
S03E15,ELAINE,I wonder what Ghandi ate before his fast.
S03E15,JERRY,I heard he used to polish off a box of Triscuits.
S03E15,ELAINE,Really?
S03E15,JERRY,"Oh, yeah. Ghandi loved Triscuits."
S03E15,JERRY,Who is it? Who is it?
S03E15,GINA,Its Gina.
S03E15,JERRY,Who?
S03E15,GINA,Martines girl friend.
S03E15,JERRY,Martine?
S03E15,GINA,You next door neighbour.
S03E15,JERRY,"Oh, Martin!"
S03E15,GEORGE,Its Martine. I think hes dying. He tried to kill himself with pills.
S03E15,JERRY,What?
S03E15,GINA,Come on.
S03E15,JERRY,In my pajamas? I better get my robe.
S03E15,GINA,We dont have enough time.
S03E15,JERRY,Itll take two seconds.
S03E15,GINA,There is no time.
S03E15,JERRY,We dont have two seconds?
S03E15,GINA,All right. Go ahead.
S03E15,JERRY,"Nah, forget it."
S03E15,GINA,"No, go ahead."
S03E15,JERRY,Nah. Ill just wear the pajamas.
S03E15,GINA,Will you just get it.
S03E15,JERRY,Are you sure?
S03E15,GINA,Forget it. Come on.
S03E15,JERRY,"Nah, Ill go get the robe."
S03E15,JERRY,Thats not too bad. Its not like a Sunny von Bulow comma. The doctor said he should snap out of it anytime.
S03E15,GINA,You know why he did this? Because I told him it was over. I did not want to see him anymore.
S03E15,JERRY,Really? Its over?
S03E15,GINA,"I could not stand it another minute. Yesterday he turned over a mans hot dog stand because he thought the man was looking at me. And then after he saw you in the hall. Ach, he was crazy with jealousy."
S03E15,JERRY,"Oh boy, did he say anything about me?"
S03E15,GINA,He does not like you. And all indications are he does not like Drakes Coffee Cake.
S03E15,JERRY,He said that?
S03E15,GINA,He was screaming about it all night. How its too sweet and it falls apart when you eat it.
S03E15,JERRY,Im sorry if I caused any trouble. I was just being friendly.
S03E15,GINA,I wasnt.
S03E15,JERRY,You werent?
S03E15,GINA,"No, I have thought about you many times. Have you thought about me?"
S03E15,JERRY,Of course.
S03E15,GINA,Tell me everything.
S03E15,JERRY,"Are you sure he cant hear anything? . . .MARTIN, MARTIN."
S03E15,GINA,I wish he was not in a coma. I wish he was dead. I wish I could pull the plug out from him.
S03E15,JERRY,"I, would, I would wait on that. I know how you feel but. Juries today, you never know how theyre going to look at a thing like this."
S03E15,GINA,I saw you looking at your watch. You want to leave? Go ahead.
S03E15,JERRY,"No, I just wanted to see what time it was."
S03E15,GINA,Are you afraid of him?
S03E15,JERRY,No.
S03E15,GINA,Then kiss me.
S03E15,JERRY,Here?
S03E15,GINA,"Yes, right here."
S03E15,JERRY,Is this the proper venue?
S03E15,GINA,You dont want to?
S03E15,JERRY,"No, no, I want to. I, I very much want to. I, I desire to. I, I pine to."
S03E15,GINA,Then kiss me right in front of him.
S03E15,JERRY,I cant. What if he wakes up?
S03E15,GINA,A man is lying here unconscious and youre afraid of him? What kind of a man are you?
S03E15,JERRY,"A man who respects a good comma. If it was one of those in and out comas, maybe. But when a guys got a coma going like this  you dont want to mess with it."
S03E15,KRAMER,Hey.
S03E15,JERRY,Hey.
S03E15,KRAMER,Did you hear about Martin?
S03E15,JERRY,"Yeah, I heard."
S03E15,KRAMER,I cant believe hes in a coma.
S03E15,KRAMER,Hes got my vacuum cleaner. You know I loaned it to him. He never returned it. The carpets are filthy. What am I going to do?
S03E15,JERRY,Who told you about Martin?
S03E15,KRAMER,Newman! Hes good friends with him.
S03E15,JERR,"Oh, big mouth Newman. I should have guessed."
S03E15,KRAMER,"Hes got all of my attachments, you know."
S03E15,JERRY,"Hey, let me ask you something. How long do you have to wait for a guy to come out of a coma before you can ask his ex-girlfriend out?"
S03E15,KRAMER,"What, Gina? Why wait? Why not just call Doctor Kavorkian?"
S03E15,JERRY,You know I dont get that whole suicide machine. Theres no tall buildings where these people live? They cant wrap their lips around a revolver like a normal person?
S03E15,KRAMER,So whats going on between you and Gina?
S03E15,JERRY,"Well, I went with her to the hospital last night."
S03E15,KRAMER,"Uh, uh."
S03E15,JERRY,So were in the room and shes trying to get me to kiss her right in front of him.
S03E15,KRAMER,"Uh, uh, you see thats the great thing about Mediterranean women. All right, so what did you do?"
S03E15,JERRY,Nothing.
S03E15,KRAMER,"Ah, what kind of a man are you? The guy is unconscious in a coma and you dont have the guts to kiss his girlfriend?"
S03E15,JERRY,I didnt know what the coma etiquette was.
S03E15,KRAMER,"There is no coma etiquette. You see thats the beauty of the coma, man. It doesnt matter what you do around it."
S03E15,JERRY,"So youre saying, his girl, his car, his clothes, its all up for grabs. You can just loot the coma victim."
S03E15,KRAMER,"Id give him 24 hours to get out of it. They cant get out of it in 24 hours, its a land rush."
S03E15,JERRY,"So if the coma victim wakes up in a month, hes thrilled, he got out of the coma. He goes home, theres nothing left?"
S03E15,KRAMER,NOTHING LEFT! Thats why Im trying to get that vacuum cleaner. Because somebodys going to grab it.
S03E15,RULA,Martins spirit came to you as a warning.
S03E15,ELAINE,Why would he come to George?
S03E15,RULA,Because George has heightened extra sensory perception. FAYGY GET YOUR FINGER OUT OF YOUR NOSE.
S03E15,GEORGE,I knew it. I always felt different.
S03E15,RULA,You are. Some coffee cake?
S03E15,GEORGE,Drakes?
S03E15,RULA,Yes.
S03E15,GEORGE,Did you buy this for me?
S03E15,RULA,"No, why?"
S03E15,GEORGE,"Ha, because I love Drakes Coffee Cake."
S03E15,RULA,Maybe I did.
S03E15,ELAINE,Take it away.
S03E15,GEORGE,She hasnt eaten in two days.
S03E15,RULA,Whos Pauline?
S03E15,GEORGE,Pauline? . . . Wait a minute. I got it. My brother once impregnated a woman named Pauline.
S03E15,RULA,Do you think about her?
S03E15,GEORGE,When I hear her name mentioned.
S03E15,RULA,Cut these with your left hand.
S03E15,GEORGE,"There was a woman, Audrey. She had a very big nose."
S03E15,RULA,"I see an Audrey, but with a small nose."
S03E15,GEORGE,"Yes, yes, she had a nose job. I loved her very deeply. Will she ever speak to me again?"
S03E15,RULA,Not in this life.
S03E15,ELAINE,Should you be smoking?
S03E15,RULA,Does it bother you?
S03E15,ELAINE,Youre pregnant.
S03E15,GEORGE,Elaine.
S03E15,RULA,I smoked when I had Faisy.
S03E15,RULA,Ah oh.
S03E15,GEORGE,Ah oh? What? What Ah oh?
S03E15,RULA,I dont know about this trip George.
S03E15,GEORGE,You can see the Cayman Islands in there? Is something going to happen to me? What?
S03E15,ELAINE,Its really bad for the fetus. Do you know that.
S03E15,GEORGE,"Elaine, shes a psychic. She knows how the kids going to be."
S03E15,GEORGE,Should I not go on this trip?
S03E15,RULA,"George, I am going to tell you something and I want you to really hear me."
S03E15,ELAINE,"Now listen. I just dont know how a person, with everything we now know about pre-natal care can put a cigarette in her mouth."
S03E15,GEORGE,"Elaine, what are you doing?"
S03E15,ELAINE,Its disgusting.
S03E15,RULA,I DONT BELIVE IT. I would like you both to leave.
S03E15,ELAINE,"Oh fine, I dont like to be around people who are just so irresponsible."
S03E15,RULA,Get the hell out.
S03E15,GEORGE,A plane crash? A Heart attack? Lupus? Is it Lupus?
S03E15,RULA,Do you want me to call the super? He was an Israeli commando.
S03E15,GEORGE,If you dont say anything I will assume its a plane crash.
S03E15,RULA,Get out.
S03E15,GEORGE,Not a plane crash. (leaving) Is it a plane crash?
S03E15,GINA,I do not like your toothbrush. There are no bristles.
S03E15,JERRY,You can say what you want about me but Ill be damned if Im going to stand here while you insult my toothbrush.
S03E15,GINA,It is too small for someone with such a big mouth (kisses Kerry). Let me ask you. What will you do if Martine wakes up? Run away like a mouse?
S03E15,JERRY,"No, more like the Three Stooges at the end of every movie."
S03E15,GINA,Who are these Stooges you speak of?
S03E15,JERRY,Theyre a comedy team.
S03E15,GINA,Tell me about them. Everything.
S03E15,JERRY,"Well, theyre three kind of funny looking guys and they hit each other a lot."
S03E15,GINA,You will show me The Stooges?
S03E15,JERRY,I will show you The Stooges.
S03E15,GINA,When?
S03E15,JERRY,"Well, I dont really know where The Stooges are right now but if I locate them you will be the first to know."
S03E15,GINA,"Come, you walk me to a cab."
S03E15,JERRY,"Well, uh, I uh, I dont want you to get upset or anything but uh, with Martin and all, well maybe its not such a good idea for us to be seen together in the building, because, you know, he had a lot of friends here."
S03E15,GINA,Youre still afraid. You are not a man.
S03E15,JERRY,Well then what are all those ties and sport jackets doing in my closet?
S03E15,GINA,Are you going to walk me to a cab or not?
S03E15,JERRY,"Yeah, all right. All right."
S03E15,KRAMER,You should just eat fruit.
S03E15,NEWMAN,I cant eat fruit. It makes me incontinent.
S03E15,KRAMER,???
S03E15,NEWMAN,Hello Gina. Hello Jerry.
S03E15,JERRY,Hello Newman.
S03E15,JERRY,Do you think Newman would tell Martin if he wakes up? What kind of sicko would do that? He could kill me.
S03E15,GEORGE,"People smoke, Elaine. My mother smoked. It didnt hurt me."
S03E15,ELAINE,(jumps with fear to Jerry) Did you see that wall move?
S03E15,JERRY,"Boy, its a good thing we came."
S03E15,GEORGE,Could there be a native p0roblem in the Caymans? Maybe theres native unrest.
S03E15,ELAINE,"Hi, I havent eaten in three days. I was wondering how much longer it would be until I get my X-ray."
S03E15,NURSE,Well call you.
S03E15,JERRY,"George, I want you to promise me something. If Im ever in a comma. In the first 24 hours get everything out of my apartment and put it in storage."
S03E15,GEORGE,How come?
S03E15,JERRY,Looters.
S03E15,ELAINE,How do we know that dog food is any good? Who tastes it?
S03E15,JERRY,Shes really hungry.
S03E15,KRAMER,Hey.
S03E15,ELAINE,Kramer
S03E15,KRAMER,"Well, Newmans upstairs visiting Martin."
S03E15,GEORGE,Would you buy my Cayman Island ticket?
S03E15,KRAMER,Youre not going?
S03E15,GEORGE,No.
S03E15,KRAMER,Why not?
S03E15,GEORGE,The psychic said something terrible will happen.
S03E15,KRAMER,I dig.
S03E15,KRAMER,"I want my vacuum cleaner! I know you can hear me. Look my mother, shes going to come and visit me. She sees that rug, shes going to kill me."
S03E15,NEWMAN,"He cant hear you, you idiot. Why dont you just buy another one."
S03E15,KRAMER,Why would I buy another one when I spent a hundred bucks on this one?
S03E15,NEWMAN,I have a carpet sweeper you can use.
S03E15,KRAMER,I dont want a carpet sweeper. They dont do anything.
S03E15,NEWMAN,It gets my rug clean.
S03E15,KRAMER,The carpet sweeper is the biggest scam perpetrated on the American public since One Hour Martinizing.
S03E15,NEWMAN,"Well, you should take a look at my rug then."
S03E15,KRAMER,I wouldnt set foot in your house.
S03E15,JERRY,Hello.
S03E15,NEWMAN,Hello Jerry.
S03E15,JERRY,Hows he doing?
S03E15,KRAMER,He looks happy to me.
S03E15,NEWMAN,I hope he stays this happy when he wakes up.
S03E15,JERRY,Why wouldnt he?
S03E15,NEWMAN,No reason.
S03E15,JERRY,"Hell have a lot of catching up to do, I guess."
S03E15,NEWMAN,Ill bring him up to date.
S03E15,JERRY,How up to date?
S03E15,NEWMAN,"Oh, all the way up."
S03E15,JERRY,And nothing could change your mind?
S03E15,NEWMAN,"Well, it would take a hell of a lot. Because a friend is something you earn."
S03E15,KRAMER,"Okay, Jerry has a friend who has free tickets to the Cayman Islands for this weekend. Hes not going."
S03E15,NEWMAN,"I dont care much for the beach. I freckle. . . . Is that a,.."
S03E15,JERRY,Drakes Coffee Cake
S03E15,NEWMAN,"Wow, where did you get that?"
S03E15,JERRY,From my house. I got a whole box of them.
S03E15,NEWMAN,"Boy, thats the full size."
S03E15,JERRY,Thats your big boy.
S03E15,NEWMAN,Can I have a bite?
S03E15,JERRY,I dont give out bites. I got another one. But Im saving it for later.
S03E15,NEWMAN,Just one bite?
S03E15,JERRY,"I dont think so. You know they, theyre so fragile."
S03E15,NEWMAN,All right! All right. I wont say anything.
S03E15,JERRY,You swear?
S03E15,NEWMAN,I swear.
S03E15,JERRY,On your mothers life?
S03E15,NEWMAN,On my mothers life.
S03E15,KRAMER,oh oh oh oh oh
S03E15,NEWMAN,"Oooh,"
S03E15,ELAINE,"And there it was, mountains of duck. And not fatty duck either, but juicy tender breasts of duck."
S03E15,GEORGE,"sweetheart, no come here,  sweetheart"
S03E15,RULA,"pew, pew, pew, pew (breathing)"
S03E15,GEORGE,how did I know you were here? Something drew me here. This is phenomenal.
S03E15,RULA,The nurse said she would be right back. Theyre supposed to take me into the delivery room.
S03E15,GEORGE,"Oh, thats great. Thats great. By the way I have to apologize for my friend the other day. Friend? Uh, uh I dont even know that woman. I met her on the bus on the way over. I couldnt get rid of her. Uh, My psychic instincts were a little off .."
S03E15,RULA,"Oh, wheres the nurse"
S03E15,GEORGE,I dont know where the nurse is. Sweetheart why dont you get a nurse for mommy?  Anyway I was just curious. Remember the other day you were saying something about my trip.
S03E15,RULA,Dont take that trip.
S03E15,GEORGE,"Yeah, why? Why?"
S03E15,RULA,"(screams) EEEY, beegit, beegit beegit."
S03E15,Dx,"All right, Rula, its time to go."
S03E15,GEORGE,Because? Because?
S03E15,ELAINE,Assassins! How dare they keep a person waiting like this!  Drakes Coffee Cake?  Give me that.
S03E15,NEWMAN,"Jerry, you better stop her or Ill tell."
S03E15,JERRY,Elaine! No! No!
S03E15,MARTIN,"Ooooh, ahhhh,"
S03E15,GEORGE,Are there terrorists on the plane? A hotel fire. Is that it? Malaria? Yellow fever? Lupus? Is it Lupus?
S03E15,NEWMAN,"He did it right in this bed, Martin. Right in front of you."
S03E15,KRAMER,I want my vacuum cleaner!
S03E15,JERRY,Hey!
S03E15,NEWMAN,It was disgusting.
S03E15,JERRY,What are you doing? Were going out to dinner in ten minutes.
S03E15,GEORGE,I never assisted in a birth before. Its really quite disgusting.
S03E15,JERRY,What did she name the kid?
S03E15,GEORGE,You wouldnt believe it. Rasputin.
S03E15,KRAMER,Heey!
S03E15,GEORGE,Hey.
S03E15,JERRY,Hey.
S03E15,GEORGE,when did you get back?
S03E15,KRAMER,A couple of hours ago.
S03E15,GEORGE,So how was it?
S03E15,KRAMER,"George, I would like to thank you for the greatest four days I ever spent in my life."
S03E15,JERRY,osh.
S03E15,KRAMER,They were shooting the Sports Illustrated swim suit issue right in the hotel pool.
S03E15,JERRY,Woah. (hitting George)
S03E15,KRAMER,Not only that but at the hotel they opened up this area on the beach for nude bathing and all of the Sports Illustrated models went down there.
S03E15,JERRY,Wow! (hitting George)
S03E15,KRAMER,I was on the next blanket from Elle McPherson
S03E15,JERRY,Oh! (hitting George)
S03E15,KRAMER,We played Backgammon in the nude.
S03E15,JERRY,Oh! (hitting George)
S03E15,KRAMER,Shes a sweet kid.
S03E15,JERRY,Nude backgammon with swimsuit models!
S03E15,KRAMER,"Oh, you know what? The second day I was there I stepped on a jellyfish. Now it kind of stung my foot. Thats probably what Rula was trying to warn you about."
S03E15,GEORGE,"Yeah, you gotta watch for the jellyfish."
S03E15,KRAMER,Yeah.
S03E15,KRAMER,Whats this?
S03E15,JERRY,"Oh, its an invitation to a house warming from Martin and Gina."
S03E15,KRAMER,They moved in together?
S03E15,JERRY,"Yeah, its some place down in the village."
S03E15,KRAMER,Phew.
S03E15,JERRY,Yeah.
S03E15,ELAINE,Its Elaine.
S03E15,JERRY,All right were coming down.
S03E15,KRAMER,"Hey, where ya going?"
S03E15,JERRY,"Were taking Elaine to dinner. Shes got to start the fast again. Um, you want to go?"
S03E15,KRAMER,"Um, Id like to but a bunch of us from the islands, well be getting together."
S03E15,GEORGE,Elle McPherson going to be there?
S03E15,KRAMER,OH! I got to call her back.
S03E16,GEORGE,"Why even try anymore? There's no sense to it. I'm never gonna meet anybody, I should just accept it."
S03E16,JERRY,"Oh, yes you will."
S03E16,GEORGE,"No, I won't."
S03E16,JERRY,"Yeah, maybe you won't."
S03E16,GEORGE,"I mean it's hard enough to meet a woman you dislike, much less like."
S03E16,JERRY,Are my nostrils getting bigger?
S03E16,GEORGE,"No. Why must it be so difficult? Why is there all this tension and hostility? Why can't I just walk up to a woman on the street and say, ""Hi. I'm"
S03E16,CYNTHIA,"There's just no men out there, you know?"
S03E16,ELAINE,I know.
S03E16,CYNTHIA,I mean the problem is that the good ones know they're good. And they know they're in such demand they're just not interested in confining themselves to one person.
S03E16,ELAINE,I hate the good ones.
S03E16,CYNTHIA,Is Jerry one of the good ones?
S03E16,ELAINE,"That's a good question, I think he thinks he is."
S03E16,CYNTHIA,"Well, the mediocre ones are available, but they're so insecure about not being one of the good ones that they're always going, ""Well I'm not good enough for you, what are you doing with me?"" and eventually I just go, ""You're right."""
S03E16,ELAINE,"You know, maybe you need somebody between good and mediocre."
S03E16,CYNTHIA,"No, maybe I need somebody who has nothing, somebody who just has to appreciate being with me because he's so desperate."
S03E16,GEORGE,I mean it's gotten to the point where I'm flirting with operators on the phone. I almost made a date with one.
S03E16,JERRY,"Oh, so there's still hope."
S03E16,GEORGE,"I don't want hope. Hope is killing me. My dream is to become hopeless. When you're hopeless, you don't care, and when you don't care, that indifference makes you attractive."
S03E16,JERRY,"Oh, so hopelessness is the key."
S03E16,GEORGE,It's my only hope.
S03E16,CYNTHIA,"See, I wouldn't really mind so much, but I feel badly for my mother. I mean, if my mother weren't around, it wouldn't be so bad. But, I'm telling you, if I'm not married by the time I'm forty, I'm gonna have to kill her because it's the only fair thing to do. I just couldn't put her through that."
S03E16,ELAINE,"Well, at least you're not bitter."
S03E16,CYNTHIA,Who says I'm not bitter?
S03E16,ELAINE,Aren't you too young to be bitter?
S03E16,CYNTHIA,"No, you can be young and bitter, just maybe not as bitter as I'm gonna be ten years from now, but I'm bitter. Anyway, don't tell anyone."
S03E16,ELAINE,"Don't worry, your bitterness is safe with me."
S03E16,CYNTHIA,"Um, order me a piece of cake. I'm gonna go throw up."
S03E16,JERRY,"Look at my hands. Look. Filthy from the paper. You know, they should give you a Wet-nap when you buy one, like at those rib joints."
S03E16,ELAINE,So what'd you do last night?
S03E16,JERRY,"Went out with George, you?"
S03E16,ELAINE,Went out with Cynthia.
S03E16,JERRY,How was it? What'd you talk about?
S03E16,ELAINE,"Well, you know, the usual; The Federal Reserve, the rainforest. Cynthia thought we should nuke the rainforest, you know, get rid of it in one fell swoop so we can at least eliminate it as a subject of conversation. What about you?"
S03E16,JERRY,"We brushed on that. Actually, George was in rare form. He just can't find anybody."
S03E16,ELAINE,"I know, Cynthia too. She's really given up."
S03E16,JERRY,George too.
S03E16,JERRY AND ELAINE (together),"Yeah, right."
S03E16,JERRY,I've never fixed anybody up.
S03E16,ELAINE,"Uh, me neither and I am not about to start with George."
S03E16,JERRY,Well why wouldn't you start with George? You think she's too good for George?
S03E16,ELAINE,"I didn't say 'too good', did I say 'too good'?"
S03E16,JERRY,Well you implied it.
S03E16,ELAINE,I didn't say it.
S03E16,JERRY,"Because if you think she's too good for George, you are dead wrong. Dead wrong. Who is she?"
S03E16,ELAINE,Who is he?
S03E16,JERRY,He's George!
S03E16,ELAINE,She's Cynthia!
S03E16,JERRY,So what?
S03E16,ELAINE,"What, you don't think she's beautiful?"
S03E16,JERRY,"I don't know, what's with the eyebrows?"
S03E16,ELAINE,You know what your problem is? Your standards are too high.
S03E16,JERRY,I went out with you.
S03E16,ELAINE,"That's because my standards are too low. And by the way, you know, women kill for eyebrows like that. Do you know that? I mean women pluck their real eyebrows out of their head, one by one, until they're bald, Jerry. Bald above the eyes! And then they paint in these eyebrows to look like that."
S03E16,JERRY,"Well let me tell you something about George. He is fast. He can run like the wind. And he's strong. I've seen him lift a hundred pounds over his head without even knowing it. And you wouldn't know it to look at him, but George can bait a hook."
S03E16,ELAINE,He can really do that?
S03E16,JERRY,"Come on, let's do it, I think they'll really get along."
S03E16,ELAINE,"What, are you into this?"
S03E16,JERRY,"Yeah, come on, it's a good match."
S03E16,ELAINE,"No, wait a minute, wait a minute. They're gonna be telling us how their dates went. Are we gonna share that information?"
S03E16,JERRY,Naturally.
S03E16,ELAINE,"Well, wait a minute, we're gonna tell each other everything, I mean every secret?"
S03E16,JERRY,Everything.
S03E16,ELAINE,What if it worked out?
S03E16,JERRY (dialing),Yeah right.
S03E16,GEORGE,Out of the question. Out of the question!
S03E16,JERRY,Why?
S03E16,GEORGE,"No! I'm not gonna do that! That's one step away from personal ads! And prostitutes! No! No, I am not going down that road! What does she look like?"
S03E16,JERRY,She's good looking.
S03E16,GEORGE,How good looking?
S03E16,JERRY,Very good looking.
S03E16,GEORGE,Really good looking?
S03E16,JERRY,Really very good looking.
S03E16,GEORGE,Would you take her out?
S03E16,JERRY,"Yes, I would take her out."
S03E16,GEORGE,"Oh, you hesitated."
S03E16,JERRY,What hesitate? I didn't hesitate!
S03E16,GEORGE,"No, something's off here, you hesitated."
S03E16,JERRY,"I'm telling you, she's good looking."
S03E16,GEORGE,"What about the body, what kind of body?"
S03E16,JERRY,"Good body, nice body."
S03E16,GEORGE,How nice?
S03E16,JERRY,Nice.
S03E16,GEORGE,Just nice?
S03E16,JERRY,Pretty nice.
S03E16,GEORGE,Really good?
S03E16,JERRY,Really very nice and good.
S03E16,GEORGE,What about personality?
S03E16,JERRY,Good personality. Funny. Bright.
S03E16,GEORGE,Smarter than me? I don't want anyone smarter than me.
S03E16,JERRY,How could she be smarter than you?
S03E16,GEORGE,"Alright, let's see, let's see. What else. What else. Oh yeah, what does she do?"
S03E16,CYNTHIA,"First of all, what does he do?"
S03E16,ELAINE,"He was in real estate, um, now, he's not working right now-"
S03E16,CYNTHIA,He's not working?! How come he's not working?
S03E16,ELAINE,"Well, um, he, he got fired."
S03E16,CYNTHIA,Why did he get fired?
S03E16,ELAINE,"Uh. Why? Oh, right. Um, well, he tried to poison his boss."
S03E16,CYNTHIA,Excuse me?
S03E16,ELAINE,"Such a long story, Cynthia, seriously, I mean he just had some problems at work."
S03E16,CYNTHIA,Is he nuts?
S03E16,ELAINE,"No, no, no, he's a really really funny guy."
S03E16,CYNTHIA,What does he look like?
S03E16,ELAINE,Pardon?
S03E16,CYNTHIA,What does he look like?
S03E16,ELAINE,"Um, well, he's got a lot of character in his face. Um, he's short. Um, he's stocky."
S03E16,CYNTHIA,"Fat. Is that what you're saying, that he's fat?"
S03E16,ELAINE,"Powerful. He is so powerful, he can lift a hundred pounds right up over his head. And um, what else. What else. Oh, right. Um, well, he's kind of, just kind of losing his hair."
S03E16,CYNTHIA,He's bald?
S03E16,ELAINE,"No! No, no, no, he's not bald. He's balding."
S03E16,CYNTHIA,So he will be bald.
S03E16,ELAINE,Yup.
S03E16,GEORGE,What kind of hair?
S03E16,JERRY,"You know, long dark hair."
S03E16,GEORGE,Flowing?
S03E16,JERRY,Flowing?
S03E16,GEORGE,"Is it flowing? I like flowing, cascading hair. Thick lustrous hair is very important to me."
S03E16,JERRY,"'Thick lustrous hair is very important to me,' is that what you said?"
S03E16,GEORGE,"Yeah, that's right."
S03E16,JERRY,Just clarifying.
S03E16,GEORGE,Let me ask you this. If you stick your hand in the hair is it easy to get it out?
S03E16,JERRY,Do you want to be able to get it out or do you want to not be able to get it out?
S03E16,GEORGE,I'd like to be able to get it out.
S03E16,JERRY,I think you'll get it out.
S03E16,GEORGE,"What about the skin? I need a good cheek, I like a good cheek."
S03E16,JERRY,She's got a fine cheek.
S03E16,GEORGE,Is there a pinkish hue?
S03E16,JERRY,A pinkish hue?
S03E16,GEORGE,"Yes, a rosy glow."
S03E16,JERRY,"There's a hue. She's got great eyebrows, women kill to have her eyebrows."
S03E16,GEORGE,"Who cares about eyebrows? Is she sweet? I like sweet. But not too sweet, you could throw up from that."
S03E16,JERRY,I don't think you'll throw up. *She* likes to throw up.
S03E16,CYNTHIA,Has he ever been married?
S03E16,ELAINE,No.
S03E16,CYNTHIA,Has he been close?
S03E16,ELAINE,He once spent a weekend with a woman.
S03E16,CYNTHIA,He didn't really try to poison his boss?
S03E16,ELAINE,"Yeah, he did."
S03E16,GEORGE,"We had an incredible phone conversation. We talked for like twenty minutes. I threw away my notes in the middle of the call. You know, I thought she had a great voice timbre. Is it timbre or tamber?"
S03E16,JERRY,I think it's tamber.
S03E16,GEORGE,"Why'd I think it was timbre? Yeah, she could do voiceover commercials, why didn't you tell me about her voice?"
S03E16,JERRY,I didn't notice the voice.
S03E16,GEORGE,It's mellifluous!
S03E16,JERRY,"So, Saturday night."
S03E16,GEORGE,"She had to be impressed by that conversation, had to! It was a great performance. I am unbelievable on the phone. On the date they should just have two phones on the table at the restaurant, done."
S03E16,ELAINE,Hi.
S03E16,GEORGE,Hey! Saturday night!
S03E16,ELAINE,I know!
S03E16,GEORGE,"So, what did she say?"
S03E16,ELAINE,She said you're getting together Saturday night!
S03E16,GEORGE,That's it?
S03E16,ELAINE,Yeah!
S03E16,GEORGE,She didn't mention anything about the conversation?
S03E16,ELAINE,No.
S03E16,GEORGE,"Now, you see, I don't get that. We had a relaxed stimulating, great conversation, she doesn't mention it? Why doesn't she mention it?"
S03E16,ELAINE,What?
S03E16,JERRY,She could have mentioned the conversation.
S03E16,GEORGE,"Alright, alright, I'll go on the date, but that's that."
S03E16,KRAMER,Hey.
S03E16,JERRY,Hey.
S03E16,KRAMER,"You know my friend, Bob Sacamano?"
S03E16,JERRY,"Oh, the guy from Jersey?"
S03E16,KRAMER,"Yeah. He just got a job at a condom factory in Edison. Look at this, he gave me a gross."
S03E16,GEORGE,What are you gonna do with all of them?
S03E16,KRAMER,"Oh, well... Come on, take some, Jerry. Grab 'em."
S03E16,JERRY,"No thanks, they look like they came out of a cereal box."
S03E16,KRAMER,"Come on, Elaine, here, take half a bag."
S03E16,ELAINE,"Half a bag? What am I, a hooker? Anyway, they look kind of cheap."
S03E16,GEORGE,I'll take one. It's possible.
S03E16,JERRY,"So where are they already, it's a quarter to twelve, they should be back by now, what did they do?"
S03E16,ELAINE,I think they went out to dinner.
S03E16,JERRY,"Wait, I got another call. That must be him. [clicks over] Hello?"
S03E16,GEORGE,"Yeah, it's me, I just got home."
S03E16,JERRY,"Oh, hold on. [clicks back] It's George, he just got home."
S03E16,ELAINE,"Yeah, yeah, I got Cynthia on the other line."
S03E16,JERRY,"Alright, I'll call you back as soon as I'm done."
S03E16,ELAINE,Remember our pact. Full disclosure.
S03E16,JERRY,"Of course. [clicks back to George] Yeah, go ahead."
S03E16,GEORGE,"Alright look, I'm gonna tell you, but I made a pact with Cynthia, we swore we were not going to tell you and Elaine."
S03E16,JERRY,"You can tell me, I'll vault it."
S03E16,GEORGE,It's in the vault?
S03E16,JERRY,I'm locking the vault. What?
S03E16,GEORGE,We had sex.
S03E16,JERRY,"Oh my god, you had sex, how did that happen?"
S03E16,GEORGE,I don't know. I closed my eyes and made a move.
S03E16,JERRY,At your apartment?
S03E16,GEORGE,Yeah.
S03E16,JERRY,She didn't stay over?
S03E16,GEORGE,"No, she left. Listen, you can't mention any of this to Elaine. Cynthia will kill me, we made a deal."
S03E16,ELAINE,Oh my god.
S03E16,CYNTHIA,He was uncomfortable because it was our first time so he felt he would perform better if we did it in the kitchen. He said the kitchen is always the most sociable room in the house. And he was serious.
S03E16,ELAINE,So? How was it?
S03E16,CYNTHIA,How good could it be? My head was on a hot plate.
S03E16,ELAINE,"Wait, I got another call, that must be Jerry."
S03E16,CYNTHIA,"Oh wait, don't you tell him any of this."
S03E16,ELAINE,"Yeah, ok. [clicks over] Hello?"
S03E16,JERRY,"So, what did she have to say?"
S03E16,ELAINE,What did he have to say?
S03E16,JERRY,He said they had a good time.
S03E16,ELAINE,Her too.
S03E16,JERRY,"Oh, good."
S03E16,ELAINE,Anything else?
S03E16,JERRY,Nope. You?
S03E16,ELAINE,Nope.
S03E16,JERRY,You sure?
S03E16,ELAINE,Yup. You?
S03E16,JERRY,Yeah.
S03E16,ELAINE,"Alright. Well uh, guess everything is under control."
S03E16,JERRY,Yeah. Okay then.
S03E16,ELAINE,Alright. Goodnight.
S03E16,JERRY,Goodnight.
S03E16,GEORGE,"I left three messages. I can't believe this woman. She has sex with me, leaves ten minutes later then I never hear from her again. What kind of a person does this? I mean, she used me. I feel cheap and violated."
S03E16,JERRY,"Well, I'm gonna do something about this."
S03E16,GEORGE,What are you gonna do?
S03E16,JERRY,"Nevermind. Disgraceful. Leaves you sitting there on the kitchen floor like some kind of roach trap. Wham, bam, thank you ma'am. Sir, whatever. She's not going to get away with this."
S03E16,GEORGE,"I keep wracking my brain to try and figure out what I did. I was smart, I was funny, I made great small talk with the waitress so she could see I could relate to the commoners, you know, I'm a man of the people."
S03E16,JERRY,I'm gonna call her.
S03E16,GEORGE,"No, don't call her."
S03E16,JERRY,"No, I'm calling her."
S03E16,GEORGE,"No, Jerry, don't call."
S03E16,JERRY,"No, forget it, I'm gonna call."
S03E16,GEORGE,I don't want you to call.
S03E16,JERRY,"Get away from me, I'm gonna call her."
S03E16,GEORGE,Give me the phone!
S03E16,JERRY,"George, do you wanna fight? Do you wanna fight?"
S03E16,GEORGE,"Jerry, I'm gonna kill you!"
S03E16,KRAMER,"Hey hey hey!! Come on! Jerry, George, now stop it!"
S03E16,JERRY,I'll just call her when you leave!
S03E16,GEORGE,"You can't do that, it's none of your business!"
S03E16,JERRY,It is so my business!
S03E16,KRAMER,Hey hey hey! I don't want to hear another word out of either one of you!
S03E16,GEORGE,But tell him to give me the--
S03E16,KRAMER,"Ay ay ay! The next one of you that opens up your mouth, says something, you're gonna have to deal with me. You know, I bet I know what this is about. It's about a woman, isn't it?"
S03E16,GEORGE,No.
S03E16,JERRY,"Yeah, but--"
S03E16,KRAMER,"Yeah yeah! You see, this is exactly what they want to do to you. They play one against the other. You can't let them manipulate you like that."
S03E16,JERRY,But Kramer--
S03E16,KRAMER,"Noh noh noh! I want you guys to shake hands. Come on, there are plenty of women out there for all of us, let's go."
S03E16,KRAMER,"Yes. You see? Isn't that better than fighting? Animosity? I mean, you wanna fight with somebody, you fight with me. Oh, by the way George, you know those condoms I gave you? They're defective, don't use them."
S03E16,GEORGE,What?
S03E16,KRAMER,Right.
S03E16,GEORGE,Defective?!
S03E16,KRAMER,Defective.
S03E16,GEORGE,(attacking Kramer) How could you give me a defective condom?!
S03E16,KRAMER,I didn't even know they were defective.
S03E16,KRAMER,Didn't even thin you were gonna use them.
S03E16,GEORGE,What do you mean you didn't think I wasn't gonna use them?!
S03E16,JERRY,"Take it easy, you guys, just spread out! Don't worry about it, if anything was wrong she would have called you already!"
S03E16,CYNTHIA,I missed my period.
S03E16,ELAINE,Oh my god.
S03E16,CYNTHIA,"I am very worried, I am never late."
S03E16,ELAINE,"But he used a condom, right?"
S03E16,CYNTHIA,"I know, but these things aren't always foolproof."
S03E16,ELAINE,Oh no.
S03E16,CYNTHIA,What?
S03E16,ELAINE,Was it blue?
S03E16,CYNTHIA,Yeah. How'd you know?
S03E16,ELAINE,Just a hunch.
S03E16,JERRY,Ow! Ow! Twist off! Twist off! Twist off!
S03E16,JERRY,"Oh, hi. Soda?"
S03E16,ELAINE,No thanks.
S03E16,JERRY,So tell me. What's the problem with your little flaky friend? She doesn't return calls?
S03E16,ELAINE,Who are you to talk about her like that? She'll call him when she's good and ready. You don't even know her.
S03E16,JERRY,"Oh, I know her. I know her type."
S03E16,ELAINE,Her type? What type?
S03E16,JERRY,"The type that doesn't return phone calls. I knew we shouldn't have done this, it was a bad idea in the first place, I told you!"
S03E16,ELAINE,"You told me? You pushed this whole thing on me, it was your idea!"
S03E16,JERRY,"I was just trying to help your bitter, twisted friend."
S03E16,ELAINE,She's not bitter!
S03E16,JERRY,"Well, bitter's a judgement call, but she's twisted!"
S03E16,ELAINE,"Twisted? God, I did you a favor."
S03E16,JERRY,"I thought you said they had a good time, is there anything else you're keeping from me?"
S03E16,ELAINE,Are you calling me a liar?
S03E16,JERRY,"I'm calling you one if you are one, are you a liar?"
S03E16,ELAINE,Are you?
S03E16,JERRY,Get your finger out of my face.
S03E16,ELAINE,"You get yours out, I was here first!"
S03E16,JERRY,I don't care.
S03E16,ELAINE,Get it out!
S03E16,KRAMER,"Hey hey, alright, hey hey, stop it! Come on, break it up! What's the matter with you? Now don't you two see that you're in love with each other? I mean, why can't you face that already? You're running around out there looking for something that's not even there, when everything that you dream of is right here, right here in front of you. Now why can't you admit that? By the way, when you see George give him these, these'll work."
S03E16,ELAINE,I knew those condoms were defective!
S03E16,JERRY,How did you know they were defective?!
S03E16,ELAINE,Because! Because she missed her period!
S03E16,GEORGE,She missed her period? Oh my god. I can't believe it! I'm a father! I did it! My boys can swim! I can do it! I can do it!
S03E16,CYNTHIA,"So he shows up. He's all out of breath. He's disheveled. And he tells me that no matter what happens, whatever I decide is fine with him and that I could depend on him, and that he would be there to support me in whatever way I need. Elaine, I was speechless."
S03E16,ELAINE,Wow. Wow. You see? You think you know somebody.
S03E16,CYNTHIA,"I said to him, ""I really appreciate this, but I just got my period."" And so, I asked him to come in, he came in--"
S03E16,ELAINE,Hi!
S03E16,GEORGE,"Sorry, we're a little late. We got so hung up in traffic."
S03E16,ELAINE,What happened?
S03E16,JERRY,Acting.
S03E16,ELAINE,Very mature.
S03E16,JERRY,Thank you. Hi Cynthia.
S03E16,CYNTHIA,Hi.
S03E16,JERRY,Well this is a great place to sit you got here.
S03E16,CYNTHIA,Best seat in the house. (Looking at George) right next to the kitchen.
S03E16,GEORGE,"(hitting Cynthia playfully with a napkin) Stop it, stop it."
S03E16,JERRY,So what are these?
S03E16,ELAINE,"Oh, we ordered some appetizers. Start eating."
S03E16,GEORGE,"(with a mouth full of food) This is good. Oh, this is good."
S03E17,KRAMER,"Wide open, I was wide open underneath! I had three inches on that guy. You two were hogging the ball."
S03E17,GEORGE,Me? It wasn't me I never even saw the ball. All you do is dribble.
S03E17,JERRY,"I have to dribble, if I give it to you, you just shoot. You're a chucker."
S03E17,GEORGE,Oh I'm a chucker.
S03E17,JERRY,"That's right, everytime you get the ball you shoot."
S03E17,GEORGE,"I can't believe you called me a chucker. No way I'm a chucker, I do not chuck, never chucked, never have chucked, never will chuck, no chuck!"
S03E17,JERRY,You chuck.
S03E17,GEROGE,Kramer am I a chucker?
S03E17,KRAMER,You're a chucker.
S03E17,GEORGE,All these years I've been chuckin' and you've never told me?
S03E17,JERRY,Well it's not an easy thing to bring up.
S03E17,KRAMER,Hey you know this is the first time we've ever seen each other naked.
S03E17,JERRY,Believe me I didn't see anything.
S03E17,KRAMER,"Oh, you didn't sneak a peak?"
S03E17,JERRY,"No, did you?"
S03E17,KRAMER,"Yeah, I snuck a peak."
S03E17,JERRY,Why?
S03E17,KRAMER,Why not? hey what about you George?
S03E17,GEORGE,"yeah, I ... I snuck a peak. ... But it was so fast I didn't see anything. It was just a blur."
S03E17,JERRY,I made a conscious effort not to look. There's certain information I just don't want to have.
S03E17,KRAMER,"Uh, I gotta go meet Newman. All right. I'll see you later."
S03E17,JERRY,All right
S03E17,KRAMER,Have a good one.
S03E17,JERRY,All right
S03E17,GEORGE,See ya.
S03E17,GEORGE,look at this guy. Does he have to stretch in here?
S03E17,JERRY,You know who that is? That's
S03E17,GEORGE,Keith Hernandez? The baseball player?
S03E17,JERRY,"Yeah, that's him."
S03E17,GEORGE,Are you sure?
S03E17,JERRY,Positive.
S03E17,GEORGE,"Wow, Keith Hernandez. He's such a great player."
S03E17,JERRY,"Yeah, he's a real smart guy too. He's a Civil War buff."
S03E17,GEORGE,I'd love to be a Civil War buff. ... What do you have to do to be a buff
S03E17,JERRY,So Biff wants to be a buff? ... Well sleeping less than 18 hours a day would be a start.
S03E17,GEORGE,ho ho ho ho. You know I only got two weeks left of unemployment. I got to prove I've been looking for a job to get an extension
S03E17,JERRY,"Hey, should we say something to him?"
S03E17,GEORGE,"Oh, yeah I'm sure he loves to hear from fans in the locker room."
S03E17,JERRY,well he could say hello to me. I wouldn't mind.
S03E17,GEORGE,He's Keith Hernandez. You're Jerry Seinfeld.
S03E17,JERRY,So?
S03E17,GEORGE,"What are you comparing yourself to Keith Hernandez. The guys a baseball player Jerry, Baseball!"
S03E17,JERRY,I know what he is. I recognized him. You didn't even notice him.
S03E17,GEORGE,"What, ... you are making some wisecracks in a night club... wo wo wo. The guy was in game SIX two runs down two outs facing elimination."
S03E17,KEITH,"Excuse me. I don't want to disturb you, I'm Keith Hernandez and I just want to tell you what a big fan I am. I love your comedy."
S03E17,JERRY,Really?
S03E17,KEITH,I've always wanted to do what you do.
S03E17,JERRY,What I do? You are one of my favorite ball players of all time
S03E17,GEORGE,Mine too.
S03E17,KEITH,I love that bit about Jimmy Olson
S03E17,JERRY,Thank you.
S03E17,GEORGE,"You know Keith, what I've always wondered, with all these ball clubs flying around all season don't you think there would be a plane crash? ..."
S03E17,KEITH,(to Jerry) Do you perform anywhere in new York right now?
S03E17,JERRY,I'm performing in this club on the east Side. You should come in.
S03E17,GEORGE,"But if you think about it...26 teams, 162 games a season, you'd think eventually an entire team would get wiped out."
S03E17,KEITH,"You know, I live on the East Side."
S03E17,JERRY,"I'll tell you what, I'll give you my number and uh, just give me a call, tell me whenever you want to go."
S03E17,KEITH,or maybe just to get together for a cup of coffee
S03E17,JERRY,Oh. that would be great.
S03E17,GEORGE,"Uh, it's only a matter of time."
S03E17,KEITH,Who's this chucker?
S03E17,JERRY,It's been three days and he hasn't called.
S03E17,ELAINE,Well maybe you should call him.
S03E17,JERRY,I can't ... I can't
S03E17,ELAINE,Why not?
S03E17,JERRY,I don't know. I just feel he should call me.
S03E17,ELAINE,What's the difference?
S03E17,JERRY,"You don't understand, Elaine. I don't want to be overanxious. If he wants to see me he has my number, he should call."
S03E17,ELAINE,"Yech, look at this ashtray. I hate cigarettes."
S03E17,JERRY,I can't stand these guys. You give your number to them and then they don't call. Why do they do that?
S03E17,ELAINE,I'm sorry honey.
S03E17,JERRY,"I mean, I thought he liked me. I really thought he liked me. we were getting along. He came over to me I didn't go over to him."
S03E17,ELAINE,"No,"
S03E17,JERRY,Why did he come over to me if he didn't want to see me?
S03E17,ELAINE,I know.
S03E17,JERRY,"What did he come over to me if he didn't want to see me? I mean here I meet this guy this great guy, a baseball player, best guy I ever met in my life. .. Well that's it. I'm never giving my number out to another guy again."
S03E17,ELAINE,Sometimes I've given my number out to guys and it takes them a month to call.
S03E17,JERRY,"Hu, good, good,... well if he's calling in a month he's got a prayer!"
S03E17,ELAINE,You know maybe he's been busy. Maybe he's been out of town?
S03E17,JERRY,"Oh, they don't have phones out of town? Why do(?) people say they're too busy. Too busy. Pick up a phone!! It takes two minutes. How can you be too busy?"
S03E17,ELAINE,Why don't you just go ahead and call him?
S03E17,JERRY,"I can't call here, it's a coffee shop. I mean what am I going to say to him?"
S03E17,ELAINE,Just ask him if he wants a to get together.
S03E17,JERRY,For what dinner?
S03E17,ELAINE,Dinner's good.
S03E17,JERRY,Don't you think that's coming on a little too strong? .. Isn't that like a turn off?
S03E17,ELAINE,"Jerry, He's A GUY!"
S03E17,JERRY,... this is all .. very confusing.
S03E17,MRS. SOKOL,You know you only have two more weeks before your benefits run out.
S03E17,GEORGE,Yes and I was hoping ... to get a thirteen week extension.
S03E17,MRS. SOKOL,So where have you been looking for work?
S03E17,GEORGE,"Well you know what I've discovered Mrs. Sokol. It's not so much the looking as the listening. I listen for work. And as I'm looking and listening I am also looking. You can't discount looking. It's sort of a combination. It's looking, and listening, listening and looking. But you must look."
S03E17,MRS. SOKOL,Can you be specific about any of these companies?
S03E17,GEORGE,"Specific, Ah, lets see. I've walked in and out of so many buildings they all .. blend in together, I uh, .."

S03E17,MRS. SOKOL,"I'm going to need an address and a phone number for this uh, Vandelay company..."

S03E17,KRAMER,Let me tell it ..
S03E17,NEWMAN,"No, you can't tell it .."
S03E17,KRAMER,You always tell it ..
S03E17,NEWMAN,"All right, tell it."
S03E17,KRAMER,Ja ja ja - just tell it
S03E17,NEWMAN,"June 14, 1987.... Mets Phillies. We're enjoying a beautiful afternoon in the right field stands when a crucial Hernandez error to a five run Phillies ninth. Cost the Mets the game."
S03E17,KRAMER,"Our day was ruined. There was a lot of people, you know, they were waiting by the player's parking lot. Now we're coming down the ramp ... [cut to film of the day - like the Zabruter film - with the Umbrella man and everything - Oh so brilliant parody!!!] ... Newman was in front of me. Keith was coming toward us, as he passes Newman turns and says, "" Nice game pretty boy."". Keith continued past us up the ramp."
S03E17,NEWMAN,"A second later, something happened that changed us in a deep and profound way front that day forward."
S03E17,ELAINE,What was it?
S03E17,KRAMER,"He spit on us.... and I screamed out, ""I'm hit!"""
S03E17,NEWMAN,Then I turned and the spit ricochet of him and it hit me.
S03E17,ELAINE,Wow! What a story.
S03E17,JERRY,Unfortunately the immutable laws of physics contradict the whole premise of your account. Allow me to reconstruct this if I may for Miss Benes as I've heard this story a number of times.
S03E17,JERRY,"Newman, Kramer, if you'll indulge me. According to your story Keith passes you and starts walking up the ramp then you say you were struck on the right temple. The spit then proceeds to ricochet off the temple striking Newman between the third and forth rib. The spit then cam off the rib turned and hit Newman in the right wrist causing him to drop his baseball cap. The spit then splashed off the wrist, Pauses In mid air mind you- makes a left turn and lands on Newman's left thigh. That is one magic luggie."
S03E17,NEWMAN,Well that's the way it happened.
S03E17,JERRY,What happened to your head when you got hit?
S03E17,KRAMER,"Well. uh, well my head went back and to the left"
S03E17,JERRY,Again
S03E17,KRAMER,Back and to the left
S03E17,JERRY,Back and to the left Back and to the left
S03E17,ELAINE,"So, what are you saying?"
S03E17,JERRY,I am saying that the spit could not have come from behind ... that there had to have been a second spitter behind the bushes on the gravelly road. If the spitter was behind you as you claimed that would have caused your head to pitch forward.
S03E17,ELAINE,So the spit could have only come from the front and to the right.
S03E17,JERRY,But that is not what they would have you believe.
S03E17,NEWMAN,I'm leavin'. Jerry's a nut. (Exits)
S03E17,KRAMER,"Wait, wait, (Exits)"
S03E17,JERRY,The sad thing is we may never know the real truth.
S03E17,GEORGE,(Frantically) Did anybody call here asking for Vandelay industries?
S03E17,JERRY,No. What happened to you?
S03E17,GEORGE,"Now, listen closely. I was at the unemployment office and I told them that I was very close to getting a job with Vandelay Industries and I gave them your phone number. So, when now when the phone rings you've got to answer ""Vandelay Industries""."
S03E17,JERRY,I'm Vandelay Industries?
S03E17,GEORGE,Right.
S03E17,JERRY,And what is that?
S03E17,GEORGE,You're in latex
S03E17,JERRY,Latex? And what do I do with latex?
S03E17,GEORGE,Ya manufacture it.
S03E17,ELAINE,Here in this little apartment?
S03E17,JERRY,And what do I say about you?
S03E17,GEORGE,You're considering hiring me for your latex salesman.
S03E17,JERRY,I'm going to hire you as my latex salesman?
S03E17,GEORGE,Right.
S03E17,JERRY,I don't think so. Why would I do that?
S03E17,GEORGE,Because I asked you to.
S03E17,JERRY,"If you think I'm looking for someone to just sit at a desk pushing papers around, you can forget it. I have enough headaches just trying to manufacture the stuff."
S03E17,JERRY,Yeah.
S03E17,KRAMER,It's Keith.
S03E17,JERRY,All right we're coming down.
S03E17,GEORGE,KEITH HERNANDEZ?
S03E17,JERRY,"Yeah, come on Elaine, lets go."
S03E17,GEORGE,Where are you goin?
S03E17,ELAINE,He's giving me a ride You know there had to have been a second spitter. But who was it? Who had the motive?
S03E17,JERRY,That's what I've been trying to figure out the past five years.
S03E17,GEORGE,What the hell are you two talking about? (All exit)
S03E17,JERRY,"Well that was really fun, thanks."
S03E17,KEITH,"Yeah, it really was."
S03E17,JERRY(MIND),Should I shake his hand?
S03E17,JERRY,"Well, ..."

S03E17,JERRY,"No, I haven't."
S03E17,JERRY(MIND),This weekend. WOW!
S03E17,JERRY,"Sure, that would be great."
S03E17,JERRY(MIND),"Damn, I was too overanxious, he must have noticed that."
S03E17,JERRY,"I mean, ... if you want to."
S03E17,KEITH,"Well, how about this Friday?"
S03E17,JERRY,"Yeah, Friday's okay."

S03E17,GEORGE,"So, uh, you gonna see him again?"

S03E18,KRAMER,The way I figure it I've already been there and I plan on rounding second tonight at around eleven o'clock.
S03E18,ELAINE,"Well, uh, I'd watch the third base coach if I were you 'cause I don't think he's waving you in. You know I hate to say this but I think we're really hitting it off. Get it? Get it?"

S03E18,JERRY,"You know I know this sounds a little arrogant but I never thought she would find anyone she would like better than me. Ya know, I guess I had my chance and that's that."

S03E18,GEORGE,I can produce Keith Hernandez right here within the hour.
S03E18,MRS. SOKOL,All right. You got ONE hour.
S03E18,GEORGE,All right Mrs. S. I and my good pal Keith Hernandez will be right back.
S03E18,GEORGE,129 west 81st street and hurry.
S03E18,GEORGE,Goodbye (exits cab)
S03E18,KEITH,"Better bring your gloves, it's freezing out there. It shouldn't take too long. I'd say maybe, oh, four hours. Really though, Jerry, there's not that much. First we got the bedroom, we got two dressers and the bed."
S03E18,JERRY,Is there a box spring?
S03E18,KEITH,What's that?
S03E18,JERRY,Is there a box spring?
S03E18,KEITH,Yeah there's a box spring but it's attached to the headboard and we'll have to take that apart. Then we got the couch.
S03E18,JERRY,Is that a sectional?
S03E18,KEITH,Yeah. Twelve pieces. <not clear> coffee table.
S03E18,JERRY,Is that a thick marble?
S03E18,KEITH,Three inches thick. Got it in Italy. But the BIG problem is going to be the convertible sofa. You see when you move it it tends to open up so it's going to be real difficult getting it down the stairs.
S03E18,JERRY,STAIRS??? There's no elevator?
S03E18,KEITH,"Nah, it's a brownstone. Three floors."
S03E18,JERRY,"I'm sorry I can't do this. I can't do it. I can't. It, it's too soon. I don't know you. I can't help you move. I'm sorry. I can't. I just can't."
S03E18,KRAMER,Hello.
S03E18,KEITH,Hello.
S03E18,KRAMER,"Oh, you don't remember me."
S03E18,KEITH,No should I [continuity error in fact he SHOULD from the basketball game]
S03E18,KRAMER,"Yeah, you should. I certainly remember you. Let me refresh your memory."
S03E18,NEWMAN,"June 14th, 1987. Mets Phillies. You made a big error. Cost the Mets the game. Then you're coming up the parking lot ramp."
S03E18,KEITH,"YOU said, ""Nice game, pretty boy."""
S03E18,KRAMER,"Ah, you remember."
S03E18,NEWMAN,And then you spit on us.
S03E18,KEITH,"Hey, I didn't spit at you."
S03E18,NEWMAN,"Oh, yeah, right."
S03E18,KRAMER,"No no no, well, then who was it?"
S03E18,KEITH,"Well lookit, the way I remember it (back to the grainy 8mm film parody) I was walking up the ramp. I was upset about the game. That's when you called me pretty boy. It ticked me off. I started to turn around to say something and as I turned around I saw Roger McDowell behind the bushes over by that gravely road.  Anyway he was talking to someone and they were talking to you. I tried to scream out but it was too late. It was already on its way."
S03E18,JERRY,I told you!
S03E18,NEWMAN,"Wow, it was McDowell."
S03E18,JERRY,But why? Why McDowell?
S03E18,KRAMER,"Well, maybe because we were sitting in the right field stands cursing at him in the bullpen all game."
S03E18,NEWMAN,He must have caught a glimpse of us when I poured that beer on his head.
S03E18,NEWMAN,It was McDowell.
S03E18,KRAMER,"Oh boy. Uh, look uh, Keith, uh, we're sorry."
S03E18,NEWMAN,"Yeah, I couldn't be sorrier. I uh."
S03E18,KEITH,"look guys, don't worry about it, I uh, Well I guess I better get going."
S03E18,KRAMER,"Wait, uh what are ya' doing?"
S03E18,KEITH,I gotta move.
S03E18,KRAMER,Want any help?
S03E18,KEITH,I'd love some.
S03E18,KRAMER,I'd love to help you move.
S03E18,NEWMAN,Me too.
S03E18,KEITH,"Ok guys, we gotta be careful of one thing. Some of the stuff's very fragile We're going to have to handle it like a baby."
S03E18,KRAMER,No sweat.
S03E18,JERRY,"Hello,  oh hi Elaine .. what's going on  no he just left  you broke up with him?  ME TOO .. what happened?  oh smoking you know you're like going out with C. Everet Coope  me  nah  I couldn't go through with it  I just didn't feel ready  so what are you doing now?  Oh, great idea, I'll meet you there in like thirty minutes. Okay bye."
S03E18,GEORGE,"Keith, Keith Wa What happened? Where's Keith?"
S03E18,JERRY,You just missed him. he just left. What do you need him for?
S03E18,GEORGE,"(out the window) Keith, Keith, up here. Can you do me a favor? I need you to go to the unemployment office with me. I, I'm Jerry's friend  the guy from the locker room,  I'm the chucker. It'll take five minutes. Wait. Wait."
S03E18,JERRY,Well Biff/ What's next?
S03E18,GEORGE,I don't know.
S03E18,TALL GIRL,Excuse me. I was walking behind you and you dropped your wallet.
S03E19,GEORGE,It's all departures. I see nothing but departures. (to the woman beside him) Do you know where the arrivals are?
S03E19,GEORGE,"Excuse me, sir, do you have the time?"
S03E19,MAN,There's a clock over there.
S03E19,GEORGE,Where?
S03E19,MAN,(pointing) There.
S03E19,GEORGE,But you have a watch on.
S03E19,MAN,It's right by the escalator.
S03E19,GEORGE,Why don't you just look at your watch?
S03E19,MAN,"I told you, it's right over there."
S03E19,GEORGE,Let me see the watch.
S03E19,MAN,"Hey! What are you, some kind of nut?!"
S03E19,GEORGE,You know we're living in a society!
S03E19,JERRY,George.
S03E19,GEORGE,Jerry. Jerry.
S03E19,JERRY,"Sorry, the flight was delayed, how long've you been waiting?"
S03E19,GEORGE,I just got here. My car broke down on the Belt Parkway.
S03E19,JERRY,Oh I can't believe-- why don't you get rid of that piece of junk.
S03E19,GEORGE,"One mile from the exit it starts shaking, really violently shaking, like it's having a nervous breakdown. It completely stopped dead."
S03E19,JERRY,So you have no car?
S03E19,GEORGE,No.
S03E19,JERRY,So what good are you?
S03E19,JERRY,"I'll tell you one thing, this chauffeur's gonna be waiting a while, O'Brien's not showing up."
S03E19,GEORGE,How do you know?
S03E19,JERRY,"He was in Chicago, the flight was overbooked, wouldn't let him on the plane. He kept screaming how he had to get to Madison Square Garden."
S03E19,GEORGE,We should take his limo.
S03E19,JERRY,"Yeah, right."
S03E19,GEORGE,"Wait a second. Think about it. He's not showing up. Wait till you see the line of cabs, its like forty-five minutes long. You said he's in Chicago."
S03E19,JERRY,He's definitely in Chicago.
S03E19,GEORGE,Well the guy's just standing there.
S03E19,JERRY,How would we do it?
S03E19,GEORGE,"We just go up to him, we say, ""We're O'Brien."""
S03E19,JERRY,Maybe he knows O'Brien?
S03E19,GEORGE,"No, he doesn't know O'Brien, if he knew O'Brien he wouldn't have a sign. Let's just do it."
S03E19,JERRY,What if we get caught?
S03E19,GEORGE,What's gonna happen? They can't kill us.
S03E19,JERRY,Who's gonna be O'Brien?
S03E19,GEORGE,I'll be O'Brien.
S03E19,JERRY,Who am I?
S03E19,GEORGE,You're you.
S03E19,JERRY,Just me?
S03E19,GEORGE,Yeah.
S03E19,JERRY,Okay.
S03E19,GEORGE,"What, you don't want to be you?"
S03E19,JERRY,"Well if you're gonna be O'Brien, why can't I be somebody?"
S03E19,GEORGE,Like who?
S03E19,JERRY,Dylan Murphy.
S03E19,JERRY,"What, now you wanna be Dylan Murphy?"
S03E19,GEORGE,Well I like Dylan.
S03E19,JERRY,You could be Colin.
S03E19,GEORGE,Colin O'Brien.
S03E19,JERRY,I'm Dylan Murphy.
S03E19,GEORGE,I'm Colin O'Brien.
S03E19,GEORGE,Are we really doing this?
S03E19,JERRY,"Come on,"
S03E19,MAN,"(to George) Hey, do you have the time?"
S03E19,GEORGE,Clock over there. (to chauffer) O'Brien.
S03E19,CHAUFFEUR,Yes sir.
S03E19,GEORGE,Sorry we're late.
S03E19,CHAUFFEUR,Here let me take that for you.
S03E19,GEORGE,Oh thank you.
S03E19,CHAUFFEUR,I'll get the car and I'll bring it around front.
S03E19,GEORGE,Thank you very much. Dylan?
S03E19,JERRY,Colin?
S03E19,GEORGE,This is incredible! This is one of the greatest things I've ever done in my life! I'm gonna call my mother.
S03E19,JERRY,What for?
S03E19,GEORGE,"I dunno, I'm in a limo. (dials) Hello ma? It's me. Guess where I am. In the back of a limo. No, nobody died. It's a long story, I can't tell you now. Because I can't. I said I can't. If I could, I would. Would you stop it? Alright, look, I'm getting off. No, I'm not telling you! How's this? I'm *never* telling you! I don't care! No! Fine! Never!!"
S03E19,JERRY,She happy for you?
S03E19,GEORGE,Can he hear us?
S03E19,JERRY,No. Why?
S03E19,GEORGE,I thought I saw him look in the mirror suspiciously.
S03E19,JERRY,He can't hear us.
S03E19,GEORGE,"Let's test him. Hey, driver. What do you say we stop off, pick up your sister, have a little fun back here? No, he can't hear us."
S03E19,JERRY,Where's he dropping us? Maybe we can get him to drop us right at my house?
S03E19,GEORGE,"We'll ask him. (opens partition) My dear fellow, where are you dropping us?"
S03E19,CHAUFFEUR,"Madison Square Garden, of course. I have the four passes."
S03E19,GEORGE,"Of course, the uh, the four passes. (closes partition) Four passes to Madison Square Garden? Wait a minute. Wait a minute! Of course! Chicago! The Knicks are playing the Bulls tonight!"
S03E19,JERRY,What?
S03E19,GEORGE,We are going to the Knick game! Michael Jordan!
S03E19,JERRY,We're going to the Knick game!
S03E19,GEORGE,Did I tell you?! Did I tell you?!
S03E19,JERRY,I can't believe it! You may have hit with this one!
S03E19,GEORGE,"You see, you see? I see things as they are and I say, 'no!' Uh, wait, you see things as they are not and you s- Wait, uh, you see things, do you see things as they are? What do you say when you see things?"
S03E19,JERRY,Lemme call Elaine and Kramer.
S03E19,GEORGE,"If I see things as they are, I would ask 'why' or 'why not?'"
S03E19,JERRY,"Elaine? It's me. What are you doing tonight? Great. George and I have tickets, four free passes to the Knicks-Bulls game, Madison Square Garden. Can you go? Great, listen, call Kramer, tell him to meet us on the corner at seven o'clock. Alright. We're gonna pick you up in a limo. That's right baby-doll. Hey listen, when we pick you up, I'm Murphy and George is O'Brien. I can't tell you now, it's a long story. I am serious. Okay. Okay bye. (opens partition) 'Scuse me, driver, we have to make a little stop first."
S03E19,CHAUFFEUR,I know.
S03E19,Jerry and GEORGE,He knows?
S03E19,GEORGE,Where are we going? Why are we pulling off here?
S03E19,JERRY,Maybe it's a shortcut.
S03E19,GEORGE,"We're on the Grand Central, there's no traffic."
S03E19,JERRY,"(opens partition) 'Scuse me, driver, why are we getting off this exit?"
S03E19,CHAUFFEUR,Pick up the other members of your party.
S03E19,GEORGE,"Right. The other members of our party. (closes partition) Other members of our party? What other members of our party? I didn't even know we were in a party. Oh, I'm telling you, the jig is up."
S03E19,JERRY,"It was a bad jig to begin with, we never should have started this jig."
S03E19,GEORGE,It was a good jig.
S03E19,JERRY,"It was a bad jig, a terrible terrible jig. What are we gonna do now? They're gonna know you're not O'Brien."
S03E19,GEORGE,There could be more than one O'Brien on a plane who ordered a limo.
S03E19,JERRY,"First of all, you don't look like any O'Brien, period."
S03E19,GEORGE,Well you should have been O'Brien.
S03E19,JERRY,I don't want to be Murphy anymore; do I still have to be Murphy?
S03E19,GEORGE,"Yes, you have to be Murphy."
S03E19,JERRY,"It makes no sense now, me being Murphy."
S03E19,GEORGE,You're Murphy!
S03E19,JERRY,I'm Seinfeld!
S03E19,GEORGE,"You're Murphy!! Look, let's just jump out of the car."
S03E19,JERRY,We're doing sixty miles an hour!
S03E19,GEORGE,"So we jump and roll, you won't get hurt."
S03E19,JERRY,"Who are you, Mannix?"
S03E19,GEORGE,We're slowing down. Are those the people?
S03E19,JERRY,"Alright put your hands up over your face, pretend you're sleeping."
S03E19,WOMAN,(reaches out to Jerry) Mr. O'Brien?
S03E19,JERRY,"No, I'm, uh, Dylan Murphy. Mr. O'Brien had a long trip, he's sleeping."
S03E19,EVA,"(whispering) Oh, well I don't want to disturb him. We're just rather excited to meet him face to face, finally. We're faithful readers of his newsletter."
S03E19,JERRY,Newsletter?
S03E19,TIM,"And of course, his great book, ""The Game""."
S03E19,JERRY,"Oh, yes, he's very proud of his work in the big game. So you've never uh, met him before?"
S03E19,EVA,No.
S03E19,JERRY,Never seen a picture of him?
S03E19,EVA,Never.
S03E19,JERRY,Not even on the book jacket?
S03E19,EVA,There was no picture on the book jacket.
S03E19,JERRY,"(nudging George) Hey O'Brien, wake up, c'mon, we got company. Wake up."
S03E19,GEORGE,Hello. I'm O'Brien.
S03E19,KRAMER,Hey!
S03E19,ELAINE,Hey!
S03E19,KRAMER,"What, you took a cab?"
S03E19,ELAINE,Yeah? So?
S03E19,KRAMER,How much do you make?
S03E19,ELAINE,I'm not telling you.
S03E19,KRAMER,C'mon.
S03E19,ELAINE,No!
S03E19,KRAMER,I'll tell you how much I make.
S03E19,ELAINE,"I know how much you make. I don't even know why I'm doing this, I don't even like basketball."
S03E19,KRAMER,You ever seen Michael Jordan?
S03E19,ELAINE,Just in those commercials.
S03E19,KRAMER,Maybe you'll see him do one of those three-sixty dunks.
S03E19,ELAINE,What's that?
S03E19,KRAMER,"Oh, it's like this, here, you guard me."
S03E19,ELAINE,Huh?
S03E19,KRAMER,Yeah.
S03E19,JERRY,(checking his watch) I don't think we're gonna make the tip off.
S03E19,TIM,You think someone's been tipped off?
S03E19,GEORGE,"So, um, you've read ""The Big Game"", have you?"
S03E19,EVA,(fawning) Yes I've read it and I've memorized it.
S03E19,GEORGE,"Tell me your impressions, I would love to hear what a young woman thinks of ""The Big Game""."
S03E19,EVA,"Well, this is sort of embarrassing, but it's changed my life. The way you analyzed the game? The way you identify the major players? Well it left me breathless. You're a brilliant, brilliant man."
S03E19,GEORGE,"Well, it's just a game. Remember that, kids."
S03E19,TIM,"Just a game. He's so humble. Don't forget what you wrote in the epilogue, the fate of the world depends on the outcome of this game."
S03E19,GEORGE,"Well, I was exaggerating a bit, just for effect."
S03E19,JERRY,He tends to exaggerate.
S03E19,GEORGE,"Okay, I mean it's serious but--"
S03E19,EVA,We are really looking forward to your speech tonight.
S03E19,GEORGE,"Uh, my speech?"
S03E19,EVA,"Yes, your secretary faxed me the copy. Would you like to look it over?"
S03E19,JERRY,Well you might as well look it over.
S03E19,KRAMER,"So what's going on, how did all this happen?"
S03E19,ELAINE,Jerry and George called me from this limo and they said we're all going to the Knicks-Bulls game.
S03E19,KRAMER,Limo? I thought that George went to pick him up.
S03E19,ELAINE,He did.
S03E19,KRAMER,Well then why would they take a limo from the airport?
S03E19,ELAINE,I don't know.
S03E19,KRAMER,That's pretty strange. Did he say anything else?
S03E19,ELAINE,"Yeah. He said, um, he said it's really important that we call them O'Brien and Murphy."
S03E19,KRAMER,O'Brien. Why would he want to be called O'Brien?
S03E19,GEORGE,...and the Jews steal our money through their Zionist occupied government and use the black man to bring drugs into our oppressed white minority communities.
S03E19,JERRY,"You're not going to open with that, are you?"
S03E19,EVA,What was that you said about the myth of the Holocaust?
S03E19,GEORGE,I said so many things.
S03E19,GEORGE,They're shooting! They're shooting!
S03E19,TIM,"(pulling out a gun) Alright, get down!"
S03E19,GEORGE,"That's really very nice of you, Eva. Thank you."
S03E19,EVA,But of course you know I would. I would do anything for you. Anything.
S03E19,TIM,"Nothing to worry about, it was just a flat tire. But rest assured, we're prepared to handle anything that might come up."
S03E19,JERRY,Nice looking Lugar.
S03E19,JODI,"I'm standing in front of the Paramount adjacent to Madison Square Garden where a growing number of vociferous and angry demonstrators are gathering to protest the very first public appearance of Donald O'Brien, the leader of the midwestern regional chapter of the Aryan Union, and reputed to be their most charismatic spokesman. The reclusive Mr. O'Brien is an advocate of the violent overthrow of the government. He has openly professed a deep admiration of Adolf Hitler. Even David Duke has denounced him as a dangerous extremist. There is a full house inside awaiting his arrival from the airport. Sources tell me he is in route and should be arriving momentarily. Police have set up barricades, but quite frankly Bill and Jean, I don't think they're any match for the emotional fuse that has been lit here tonight. Reporting from the Paramount, I'm Jodi Baskerville, back to you in the studio."
S03E19,KRAMER,"Something's very strange. George goes to the airport to pick up Jerry. They come back in a limo with four tickets to the basketball game and wanna be called O'Brien and Murphy? O'Brien. O'Brien, why O'Brien?"
S03E19,DAN,Elaine?
S03E19,ELAINE,"Dan! Oh, hi Dan, how are you?"
S03E19,DAN,Good.
S03E19,ELAINE,"Um, oh, this is um, Kramer."
S03E19,DAN,"Oh, Kramer?"
S03E19,ELAINE,What's going on?
S03E19,DAN,"Oh, we're heading down to protest this big neo-nazi rally. The head of the Aryan Union is speaking, he's in from Chicago. You should come."
S03E19,ELAINE,"Oh, can't, I'm going to the Knicks-Bulls game."
S03E19,DAN,"Oh, well that's where the rally is. The Paramount, right next door."
S03E19,ELAINE,"Oh, well, maybe we'll run into you."
S03E19,DAN,"Yeah, yeah ok. It's really gonna be something, this is the first time he's ever appeared in public, no one even knows what he looks like."
S03E19,KRAMER,Who?
S03E19,DAN,The head of the Aryan Union; O'Brien.
S03E19,JERRY,What's taking him so long out there?
S03E19,GEORGE,Didja see the way she was looking at me?
S03E19,JERRY,"She's a Nazi, George. A Nazi!"
S03E19,GEORGE,"I know, I know. Kind of a cute Nazi though."
S03E19,JERRY,"Well we gotta make a plan before they come back, what are we gonna do?"
S03E19,GEORGE,I don't know.
S03E19,JERRY,Let's just make a run for it.
S03E19,GEORGE,"I can't run, I have a bad hamstring."
S03E19,JERRY,How'd that happen?
S03E19,GEORGE,I hurt it in a hotel room. You know where they tuck the covers in real tight in those hotel rooms? I can't sleep like that so I tried to kick it out and I pulled it.
S03E19,JERRY,"I know, why do they make that bed so tight? You gotta sleep with your feet like that."
S03E19,GEORGE,"For a mental patient. Wait a minute, the phone, we'll call the police."
S03E19,GEORGE,"9... 1... 1. She said she'd do anything. Hello, police? Uh, yeah listen, we're in the back of a limo in Queens--"
S03E19,GEORGE,"--Astroturf? You know who's responsible for that, don't you?! The Jews! Ah, the Jews hate grass. They always have, they always will."
S03E19,TIM,We'll be ready in a minute.
S03E19,GEORGE,"Would you excuse us for a minute Tim boy, we're kind of in the middle of something."
S03E19,TIM,"With all due respect, Mr. O'Brien, we're just about to leave."
S03E19,GEORGE,"Tim, who's the head of the Aryan Union, you or me?"
S03E19,TIM,You are.
S03E19,GEORGE,And who's responsible for making hate mongering and fascism popular again?
S03E19,TIM,You are.
S03E19,GEORGE,Good. I think you forgot something.
S03E19,TIM,I'm sorry.
S03E19,GEORGE,Good. Now get out.
S03E19,GEORGE,"Okay, what are we gonna do?"
S03E19,JERRY,I don't know.
S03E19,GEORGE,"Alright, how's this? We wait till we get to your street corner, we see Elaine and Kramer then we get out. They can't shoot us in the city."
S03E19,JERRY,Nah. No one's ever been shot in the city.
S03E19,KRAMER,"I'm telling you, something's going on. I can feel it, sense it."
S03E19,ELAINE,I'm sure he was just joking around.
S03E19,KRAMER,"Oh no no no, this is no joke. O'Brien's coming in from Chicago, Jerry's in a limo, says he's O'Brien? That's not funny. Oh my god. Yes. Yes!"
S03E19,ELAINE,What is it?
S03E19,KRAMER,"Don't you see? There's always been something very strange about Jerry, always so clean and organized. Do I have to spell it out for you? The limo? The name? The rally at Madison Square Garden? Jerry, O'Brien are the same person. Jerry is the leader of the Aryan Union!"
S03E19,ELAINE,Jerry's a nazi?!
S03E19,KRAMER,I can't believe I didn't see it.
S03E19,ELAINE,"Listen, you idiot! Just calm down! I know Jerry, he's not a nazi."
S03E19,KRAMER,You don't think so.
S03E19,ELAINE,"No, he's just neat."
S03E19,TIM,You know it's funny. You don't look like an O'Brien.
S03E19,GEORGE,Me??
S03E19,TIM,And you really don't look like a Murphy.
S03E19,JERRY,I may not look like a Murphy but I act like a Murphy.
S03E19,GEORGE,He's extremely Murphy. He's Murphy to a fault.
S03E19,TIM,Where are you from?
S03E19,JERRY,"Dublin. Originally. Parents came over here when I was eighteen. Cereal famine. Couldn't get a bowl anywhere. Bad. 'Tis a beautiful country though; lush rolling hills, and the peat, ah the peat."
S03E19,TIM,Sounds more like Scottish.
S03E19,JERRY,We were right on the border.
S03E19,KRAMER,Maybe he's with the company.
S03E19,ELAINE,What?
S03E19,KRAMER,The CIA! Maybe they placed him in there to infiltrate the organization from within.
S03E19,ELAINE,What about his comedy act?
S03E19,KRAMER,"That's the perfect cover! All that time on the road? Look Jerry, he's too normal to be a comedian. These comedians, they're sick, neurotic people."
S03E19,ELAINE,What about George?
S03E19,KRAMER,"What about him, he's part of it. His whole personality is a disguise. No real person can act the way he does. Elaine, I'm telling you they're with the organization. They're all part of it. He's in there with Helms and Hunt and Liddy, that whole crowd. George and Jerry, they probably know who killed Kennedy!"
S03E19,ELAINE,I'll bet they were even in on it.
S03E19,KRAMER,"Alright, what are we gonna do? I'm not gonna let him hurt you. (grabs and hugs Elaine tightly) I'm not gonna."
S03E19,ELAINE,"Kramer, you're hurting me!"
S03E19,GEORGE,"Those are my friends I was telling you about. We're gonna talk to them, pull over."
S03E19,ELAINE,Get off of me!!
S03E19,KRAMER,O'Brien.
S03E19,MAN #1,O'Brien? Is that him?
S03E19,MAN #2,"Yeah, that's him."
S03E19,MAN #3,Look there's O'Brien!
S03E19,MAN #4,Filthy nazi bastard!
S03E19,ALL FOUR MEN,Let's get him!!
S03E19,GEORGE,What do I do?! What do I do?!
S03E19,JERRY,Get in the car! Get in the car!
S03E19,KRAMER,"(pointing to Jerry) O'Brien. Long time no see. How's tricks, Murphy?"
S03E19,TIM,Why did you call him O'Brien and him Murphy?
S03E19,JERRY,"No, he was talking to me, he's cross-eyed."
S03E19,ELAINE,It could be very confusing.
S03E19,KRAMER,Yeah? Eva?
S03E19,EVA,It's for me. (takes phone) Hello? (cups receiver) It's O'Brien.
S03E19,KRAMER,O'Brien? Well that's weird.
S03E19,EVA,(gun drawn) Who are you?
S03E19,JODI,"A limousine has just pulled up it's being surrounded by a huge group of protestors, this has the makings of a very ugly scene."
S03E19,JODI,"They are banging on the car, trying to flip it over. The police seem unable or unwilling to control the crowd, I would imagine Mr. O'Brien must be having some very grave doubts if he made the right choice for his first public appearance."
S03E19,EVA,Get out!!
S03E19,ELAINE,"Look, it's Dan! Hi Dan!"
S03E19,DAN,Elaine?
S03E19,ELAINE,Hey!
S03E19,GEORGE,I am not O'Brien! I am not O'Brien! I'm not O'Brien! Ask anyone! Jerry?! Jerry?!!
S03E20,ELAINE,"You know it's bad enough you have a car phone, you have to use the speaker?"
S03E20,JERRY,It's safer! Plus it's more annoying to the other person.
S03E20,JERRY,Oh look at this guy.
S03E20,ELAINE,What's goin' on?
S03E20,JERRY,"Oh there's a guy trying to get in front of me, he has to ask permission. Yes. Go ahead. Get in, get in."
S03E20,ELAINE,Did you get a thank you wave?
S03E20,JERRY,"No, nothing. How could you not give a thank you wave? Hey buddy! Where's my thank you wave?"
S03E20,JERRY,Give me that wave!
S03E20,ELAINE,"Jerry, are you free on Friday?"
S03E20,JERRY,"Yeah, I'm free, why?"
S03E20,ELAINE,"Ah, God, I bumped into Robin Sandusky today, she asked me to have dinner with her and her husband."
S03E20,JERRY,"Oh my God! You won't believe what I just saw! A car just bashed into a parked car, and sped off, right on my block!"
S03E20,ELAINE,You gotta follow that car!
S03E20,JERRY,What?
S03E20,ELAINE,You can't let him get away with that!
S03E20,JERRY,"Elaine, the guy could be dangerous."
S03E20,ELAINE,"What are you, yellow?"
S03E20,JERRY,I'm not yella. (In a cowboy voice)
S03E20,ELAINE,"Jerry, if you don't follow him, you're yella."
S03E20,JERRY,"Wait, he stopped, he's parking."
S03E20,ELAINE,What? What? I can't hear you. Jerry?
S03E20,JERRY,"Uh, excuse me, uh, I was uh, driving behind you, uh, a few blocks back, and I, I couldn't help, uh, maybe you didn't realize, uh, I witnessed that, uh, um, you're tire's a little low. That can affect the performance of the twin high-beam suspension, not to mention your rack and pinion steering."
S03E20,JERRY,So I wound up going out for a decaf cappuccino with her.
S03E20,GEORGE,Boy! What a story! I'm speechless. Speechless. I have no speech.
S03E20,JERRY,"You know, I really liked her. We talked. We flirted. And when she left, she reached out and touched my arm."
S03E20,JERRY,"He, he, he. (Simulating her feminine laugh)"
S03E20,GEORGE,I love when they touch your arm. I can't get enough of that. Why is that?
S03E20,JERRY,Let's not even analyze it.
S03E20,GEORGE,So you didn't turn her in?
S03E20,JERRY,I wanted to but I couldn't go through with it.
S03E20,GEORGE,Gonna see her again?
S03E20,JERRY,Friday night.
S03E20,JERRY,Yep.
S03E20,ELAINE,It's me!
S03E20,JERRY,Come on up.
S03E20,JERRY,"By the way, Elaine does not need to know about anything."
S03E20,GEORGE,"Hey, hey, hey! I dig."
S03E20,JERRY,"Oh, you dig?"
S03E20,GEORGE,Yes! I see enormous potential here.
S03E20,JERRY,Why?
S03E20,GEORGE,Because great couples always have a great story about how they met. That's why I've never been in a long term relationship. I've never had a good meeting story.
S03E20,JERRY,I wonder if I'm nuts for pursuing this woman at all.
S03E20,GEORGE,I don't think so.
S03E20,JERRY,"Look, she slammed into a parked car! She took no responsibility for mutilating the property of a stranger, then she sped off like a criminal!"
S03E20,JERRY,"On the other hand, does that mean she should never be allowed to date again? You scratch one car and you're forbidden to have social contact for the rest of your life?!"
S03E20,JERRY,"What am I drinking, milk?"
S03E20,ELAINE,Hey!
S03E20,JERRY,Hi.
S03E20,ELAINE,Sweater.
S03E20,JERRY,Thank you.
S03E20,ELAINE,So? What happened?
S03E20,JERRY,With that?
S03E20,ELAINE,With the car!
S03E20,JERRY,What car?
S03E20,ELAINE,The hit and run!
S03E20,JERRY,"Oh, right, right, right, right, right, right, right, the hit and run. Well. Actually, the guy went into Queens."
S03E20,ELAINE,Queens?! You followed him over the bridge?
S03E20,JERRY,Over the bridge. (Making a pointing motion with his hand)
S03E20,GEORGE,"Oh, well I didn't know you went into Queens Jerry."
S03E20,JERRY,"Yeah, Queens."
S03E20,ELAINE,So? Then what?
S03E20,JERRY,"So he gets out of the car, I say, ""Hey buddy! I saw you hit that car!"" So he says to me, ""What are ya gonna do about it?"""
S03E20,JERRY,"So I said to him, ""Whatever's necessary."""
S03E20,ELAINE,I am speechless. I am without speech.
S03E20,GEORGE,Tell her about the shoving.
S03E20,JERRY,What?
S03E20,ELAINE,What shoving?!
S03E20,JERRY,"Oh, it was nothing."
S03E20,GEORGE,No! Tell her.
S03E20,JERRY,"Well he kinda lost his temper, and he was pushing me up against the car. So I went into a karate stance. (Jerry assumes karate position and does two punches)"
S03E20,ELAINE,You know karate??
S03E20,JERRY,I know a little.
S03E20,ELAINE,"Well, this is so, amazing to me! Jerry what did do?"
S03E20,JERRY,He backed off. Pretty pathetic actually.
S03E20,KRAMER,Hey! (Group does likewise)
S03E20,ELAINE,Did you tell Kramer?
S03E20,JERRY,"Ah, nah! (Waving his hand and walking away)"
S03E20,KRAMER,What? What? What? Tell me.
S03E20,ELAINE,"Jerry saw this guy crash into a car, and he followed him."
S03E20,KRAMER,"Good for you! What kind of a sick lowlife would do a thing like that? You know those people, you know they're mentally disturbed. (Pointing a finger at Jerry)"
S03E20,KRAMER,They should be sent to Australia.
S03E20,JERRY,Australia?
S03E20,KRAMER,"Yeah, yeah, that's where England used to send their convicts."
S03E20,JERRY,But not anymore.
S03E20,KRAMER,No.
S03E20,ELAINE,"Hey Kramer, Kramer!"
S03E20,KRAMER,Yeah?
S03E20,ELAINE,What happened to you right here? (She pointing to her forehead)
S03E20,KRAMER,I don't know!
S03E20,KRAMER,"You know I was watching Entertainment Tonight, and uh, suddenly I got dizzy. And the next thing I know I hit my head on the coffee table."
S03E20,ELAINE,"Well, that is, that is strange."
S03E20,KRAMER,Yep. (Mumbles off)
S03E20,ELAINE,"Alright, oh Jerry, we're still on for Friday night, right?"
S03E20,JERRY,"Oh Friday, I can't, I'm sorry, I have a date."
S03E20,ELAINE,But last night you said you were free! (Sounding very disappointed)
S03E20,JERRY,We just met.
S03E20,KRAMER,Maybe it was a reaction to the sardines.
S03E20,ELAINE,"But I, I can't go alone!"
S03E20,JERRY,Ask George to go with you.
S03E20,ELAINE,"George, come on! I'll pay for you."
S03E20,GEORGE,You'll pay? I'm there.
S03E20,JERRY,Why do you even need anybody?
S03E20,ELAINE,"Because I hate being at a table alone, with a married couple. Talking about their married friends, and their married furniture. They're always trying to make me feel like their life is so much better than mine. You know, I have a very exciting life. It's very exciting. (As she's closing the door to leave)"
S03E20,ROBIN,You went out with a bullfighter?
S03E20,ELAINE,"Yes, well, an ex-bullfighter now."
S03E20,MICHAEL,Wow.
S03E20,ROBIN,What was his name?
S03E20,ELAINE,"His name? Name, um, his name was uh, uh, Eduardo Carochio."
S03E20,GEORGE,Pass the salt please.
S03E20,ROBIN,Where did you meet him?
S03E20,ELAINE,"Um, actually, I met him in Switzerland, and he was fighting uh, is that the word they use? Fighting? Because they don't really fight the bull, they avoid fighting the bull."
S03E20,GEORGE,Bread.
S03E20,ELAINE,I just love meeting new people. You know that's how you really do learn about life.
S03E20,GEORGE,God bless you.
S03E20,ROBIN,Thank you.
S03E20,GEORGE,"I wasn't going to say anything, but then I could see that he wasn't going to open his mouth. (Chuckles)"
S03E20,WOMAN,You know who's a good actor? Anthony Quinn.
S03E20,JERRY,"Oh, Anthony Quinn, fine actor. But from what I understand, not a very good driver. Hits everything on the road. But always leaves a note."
S03E20,WOMAN,Did you ever see Zorba the Greek?
S03E20,JERRY,Excellent film. In fact Quinn said he never felt so good as when he left a note after smacking into a car.
S03E20,WOMAN,Come here. (moves in for a kiss)
S03E20,GEORGE,"Really, I was, I was only kidding around."
S03E20,ROBIN,He was only joking Michael.
S03E20,MICHAEL,You think you're so damn special because you say 'God bless you'?
S03E20,GEORGE,"No, no, I don't think I'm special. My mother always said I'm not special."
S03E20,ROBIN,He was only joking Michael! Sorry.
S03E20,MICHAEL,All right! Take his side!
S03E20,ROBIN,I am not taking his side.
S03E20,MICHAEL,Well who's side are you taking?!
S03E20,ROBIN,Well I'm not taking your side!
S03E20,JERRY,"Kirk Douglas. Now there's another very bad driver. But he's such an unbelievable guy, that when he hits someone, he doesn't even leave a note. He sits in his car and waits for the other person to show up so he can exchange license, registration, and apologize."
S03E20,GEORGE,I said 'God bless you'. Was that so wrong?
S03E20,JERRY,"The question is, did you allow a space for the husband to come in with his 'God bless you'? Because as the husband, he has the right to first refusal."
S03E20,ELAINE,It's me.
S03E20,JERRY,Come on up.
S03E20,GEORGE,"Yes, yes, I definitely waited. But let me say this Once he passes on that option, that 'God bless you' is up for grabs."
S03E20,JERRY,"No argument. Unless, she's one of these multiple sneezers, and he's holding his 'God bless you' in abeyance, until she completes the series."
S03E20,GEORGE,"Well I don't think she is a multiple sneezer, because she sneezed again later, and it was also a single."
S03E20,JERRY,What if she's having an off night?
S03E20,ELAINE,Hi!
S03E20,JERRY,Hi.
S03E20,ELAINE,Well! If it isn't mister gesuntheit!
S03E20,GEORGE,"Oh ya, like there's something wrong with saying 'God bless you'. I was raised to say 'God bless you'."
S03E20,GEORGE,"Ah, shut up."
S03E20,ELAINE,What does it mean anyway? 'God bless you'. It's a stupid 'stuperstition'.
S03E20,JERRY,A stupid what?
S03E20,ELAINE,Whatever.
S03E20,JERRY,"You know, if you want to make a person feel better after they sneeze, you shouldn't say 'God bless you', you should say, 'You're soo good lookin''."
S03E20,ELAINE,"Yeah, yeah, that's better than 'God bless you'. Anyway, she left a message on my machine, she wants you to call her."
S03E20,GEORGE,Who?
S03E20,ELAINE,Robin!
S03E20,GEORGE,Why?!
S03E20,ELAINE,"Well I assumed she called to apologize, that's why she called me."
S03E20,JERRY,Entertainment Tonight's on.
S03E20,GEORGE,Where's the remote phone?
S03E20,JERRY,Bedroom.
S03E20,ELAINE,"Hey, grab Jerry's sweater for me, would you?"
S03E20,JERRY,What's it like out?
S03E20,ELAINE,Chilly out.
S03E20,JERRY,Can I take a sweater?
S03E20,ELAINE,"Yeah, you can take a sweater if you want to."
S03E20,JERRY,Scarf?
S03E20,ELAINE,"Nah, hey, shut this off, shut it off."
S03E20,JERRY,What's the matter? What's going on?
S03E20,KRAMER,What happened?!
S03E20,ELAINE,What?
S03E20,KRAMER,I think I hit my head again!
S03E20,JERRY,What is wrong?!
S03E20,ELAINE,"Hey, hey, wait a minute! Let me ask you something. Kramer, the last time you hit your head, was Mary Hart on TV?"
S03E20,KRAMER,Yeah.
S03E20,ELAINE,That is it!
S03E20,KRAMER,What?
S03E20,ELAINE,"That is it! Mary Hart's voice, don't you see? There's something about Mary Hart's voice that's giving you seizures. Just like, just like, just like that woman in Albany!"
S03E20,KRAMER,Mary Hart!
S03E20,GEORGE,God.
S03E20,ELAINE,What?
S03E20,GEORGE,"Well she apologized, and then she wanted to know if we could get together Wednesday afternoon."
S03E20,JERRY,Get together?
S03E20,GEORGE,Maybe she just wants to talk to me?
S03E20,ELAINE,Married women don't 'get together'. They have affairs.
S03E20,GEORGE,"Oh my God, an affair. That's so adult. It's like with stockings and martinis, and William Holden. On the other hand it probably wouldn't cost me any money."
S03E20,ELAINE,Are you actually considering this?
S03E20,GEORGE,"I can't have an affair with a married woman, that's despicable!"
S03E20,ELAINE,"Yeah, it's like hitting a car and driving away without leaving a note."
S03E20,JERRY,Yeah.
S03E20,KRAMER,"Hey, you know who owns that car?"
S03E20,JERRY,What car?
S03E20,KRAMER,The one that was hit a couple of nights ago.
S03E20,JERRY,Yeah who?
S03E20,KRAMER,"That blond across the street. You know the one with the long ponytail, she wears those blue sweatpants."
S03E20,JERRY,"The blond with the blue sweatpants! Yeah, I think I've seen her."
S03E20,ELAINE,Well I've got to get going. I'm meeting a guy with grey sweatpants.
S03E20,KRAMER,"Wait, wait, wait, how do you know it's not John Tesh?"
S03E20,JERRY,The blond with the blue sweatpants!
S03E20,GEORGE,"Well, who is she?"
S03E20,JERRY,I've had a crush on this woman for year! I've always been afraid to approach her! She looks like she belongs on one of these Hallmark cards.
S03E20,GEORGE,"Oh right, right! The blue sweatpants! Gees, it's too bad you can't say anything because of Angela."
S03E20,JERRY,"Oh yeah. Too bad. Angela. Lousy thug. I mean what kind of sick person does something like that? That woman belongs in prison! I mean, I actually owe it to society to do something about this! I can't sit by and allow this to go on. It's a moral issue is what it is!"
S03E20,GEORGE,You can't compromise your principles!
S03E20,JERRY,How am I going to live with myself?!
S03E20,GEORGE,Can't live!
S03E20,JERRY,"I'm not religious, but I certainly know where to draw the line!"
S03E20,GEORGE,This country needs more people like you!
S03E20,JERRY,"Don't sell yourself short saying 'God bless you' to every Tom, Dick and Harry in great personal risk."
S03E20,GEORGE,I believe strongly in that as you know.
S03E20,JERRY,There should be more people like us.
S03E20,GEORGE,That's why the world's in the shape it's in.
S03E20,JERRY,You're telling me.
S03E20,JERRY,"Anyway, I just wanted you to know, that I'm going to do everything I can to make sure the party responsible is made to be responsible or something very close to that."
S03E20,BECKY,Well God bless you.
S03E20,JERRY,Thank you very much.
S03E20,GEORGE,Oh my God. I must be crazy. What have I done?
S03E20,ROBIN,"Oh no, what's wrong?"
S03E20,GEORGE,What's wrong? I'll tell you what's wrong. I just committed adultery!
S03E20,ROBIN,"You didn't commit adultery, I did."
S03E20,GEORGE,Oh yeah.
S03E20,ROBIN,"If I didn't do it with you, I would have done it with someone else."
S03E20,GEORGE,"Well, I wouldn't want you to do that. You know there's a lot of losers out there."
S03E20,ROBIN,Maybe even someone who didn't say 'God bless you'.
S03E20,GEORGE,"Well, that's a given."
S03E20,ROBIN,"In three years with Michael, not one 'God bless you'."
S03E20,GEORGE,Must be hell living in that house.
S03E20,MICHAEL,"Hi, it's Michael."
S03E20,ELAINE,"Hi, Michael!"
S03E20,MICHAEL,Is Robin there?
S03E20,ELAINE,"Robin? No, why?"
S03E20,MICHAEL,"Uh, she said she was going to be with you."
S03E20,ELAINE,"No I haven't spoken to her all day-uh, yeah right, um, as a matter of fact, um, she was here, and she uh, left a note, but I wasn't here, but I have the note, uh, right here."
S03E20,MICHAEL,"If she's not with you, then where is she?"
S03E20,ELAINE,"Well I, I don't know."
S03E20,MICHAEL,Is she with your bald friend from the other night?!
S03E20,ELAINE,"No, no, come on Michael!"
S03E20,MICHAEL,"He's finished! I'm going to sew his ass to his face! I'm going to twist his neck so hard his lips will be his eyebrows! I'm going to break his joints, and reattach them!"
S03E20,ELAINE,You're soo good lookin'.
S03E20,ANGELA,"Now you listen to me, suck face! You tell anybody, anything, and I will carve my initials in your brain tissue!"
S03E20,JERRY,Let me rephra-
S03E20,ANGELA,"I'll bash your skull into a vegematic like a bad cabbage, and I'll have a party on your head!"
S03E20,JERRY,"Hi Elaine, this is Angela."
S03E20,ANGELA,I'll pluck all your body hairs out with my teeth!
S03E20,JERRY,Well I think I get the gist of it.
S03E20,ANGELA,So you don't say anything to anybody about me hitting that car!
S03E20,JERRY,What car?
S03E20,ANGELA,Good. I'm glad we understand each other.
S03E20,JERRY,It's not complicated.
S03E20,ELAINE,Very nice meeting you!
S03E20,ELAINE,Come on up.
S03E20,ELAINE,"Well, well, well, Mr. Seinfeld! That must have been so frightening! When you confronted that guy, in Queens! Now, let's just see if I've got this scenario right."
S03E20,JERRY,Alright Elaine.
S03E20,ELAINE,"No, no, no, no, no. Because I'm picturing 'French Connection', kind of thing. You know? Sort of a Popeye Doyle chase through the city!"
S03E20,JERRY,It was just a couple of blocks.
S03E20,ELAINE,"Oh no, no, come on. Don't be so modest!"
S03E20,GEORGE,Hey.
S03E20,ELAINE,"Oh, did you check you machine?"
S03E20,GEORGE,"No, why, what's happening?"
S03E20,ELAINE,"Michael called me today, and he asked me where Robin was."
S03E20,GEORGE,"Yeah, okay."
S03E20,ELAINE,And I said I hadn't seen her.
S03E20,GEORGE,What?!
S03E20,ELAINE,"No, no George! You don't understand! She didn't tell me she was using me as an excuse! Okay?! But then I realized what was going on, and I said that she left a note. Um, but he didn't really buy that. And then, and then he did mention your name."
S03E20,GEORGE,He mentioned my name?! What did he say?!
S03E20,ELAINE,He said he was going to sew your ass to your face.
S03E20,GEORGE,What? Why couldn't you think of something?!
S03E20,ELAINE,"Well I don't know, he caught me off guard!"
S03E20,GEORGE,You lie! How hard is it to lie?!
S03E20,JERRY,It's not that hard.
S03E20,ELAINE,Well who told you to sleep with her George?!
S03E20,GEORGE,It's not my fault! I wasn't going to do anything until you got her all juiced up with your story about having the affair with the matador!
S03E20,ELAINE,Oh Gosh! None of this would never have happened if you wouldn't have said 'God bless you'!
S03E20,GEORGE,Oh don't-
S03E20,JERRY,Hold it! Hold it! Hold it people! Matador? What matador?
S03E20,GEORGE,She told this couple she had an affair with a matador.
S03E20,JERRY,"A matador! Well, well, well. Uno momento por favor. Pray tell, what was the young man's name?"
S03E20,ELAINE,"Uh, Eduardo, uh, Carochio."
S03E20,JERRY,"Eduardo, Carochio! That's good. That's very good. Kind of just rolls of the tongue. I wonder where on the upper west side a single girl might meet a matador? Perhaps Zabars? Or Les Pizza!"
S03E20,JERRY,"Anyway, this person told me to tell you to get an estimate on the damage."
S03E20,BECKY,"Well, I already got an estimate. It's $875."
S03E20,JERRY,$875?
S03E20,BECKY,That's right.
S03E20,JERRY,"Uh, well, I'll tell you what. Um, I'll give you a check, and then this person can pay me back."
S03E20,JERRY,"Um, who do I make it out to?"
S03E20,BECKY,Becky Gelke. G-E-L-K-E.
S03E20,JERRY,"So, what are you doing this weekend?"
S03E20,BECKY,"You have got some nerve! You smash up my car, you don't admit it, and now you want to ask me out on a date?"
S03E20,JERRY,I didn't do it!
S03E20,BECKY,Yeah righ-
S03E20,JERRY,You are soo good lookin'.
S03E20,BECKY,Thank you.
S03E20,GEORGE,"Jerry, let's go! You ready?"
S03E20,JERRY,You sure you want to do this? I'm going to be on the road for three weeks!
S03E20,GEORGE,"Excuse me, I've got a maniac stalking me, I'm not staying in the city."
S03E20,JERRY,Alright!
S03E20,GEORGE,Come on let's get out of here.
S03E20,KRAMER,How could you?
S03E20,JERRY,What?!
S03E20,KRAMER,Man! I never thought you were capable of this!
S03E20,JERRY,What did I do?
S03E20,KRAMER,"I just talked to Becky Gelke outside, she told me how you hit and ran."
S03E20,JERRY,I-
S03E20,KRAMER,I don't even want to look at you anymore! All these years of friendship and you're nothing but a felon. You're an embarrassment to the building.
S03E20,JERRY,I didn't do it! I just had to pay her to cover for somebody else!
S03E20,KRAMER,"Now you're not going to lie to me, are you?"
S03E20,JERRY,"No, never."
S03E20,KRAMER,Alright. Well. Glad we got that straightened out because I've got a date with her.
S03E20,JERRY,You got a date with Becky Gelke?!
S03E20,KRAMER,"Yeah, going out with her Saturday night."
S03E20,GEORGE,"Jerry, can we get out of here?!"
S03E20,KRAMER,"As a matter of fact, if it wasn't for you, I wouldn't have even had an excuse to talk to her."
S03E20,JERRY,"Well I'm happy to help, in any way that I can."
S03E21,NINA,"(laughing) Kramer, would you hold still? I cant do this if you keep moving."
S03E21,KRAMER,You sure you dont want me to take my clothes off? (beat) Ill do it!
S03E21,NINA,"No, thats the last thing in the world I want you to do."
S03E21,KRAMER,"Well, why dont you take your clothes off?"
S03E21,NINA,I dont know... I dont think Jerry would like that.
S03E21,KRAMER,"(debonair smile) Well, itd be our little secret."
S03E21,[CUT TO,Jerrys apartment]
S03E21,GEORGE,"(bursting out of the bathroom, fumbling with his fly) Button fly! Why do they put buttons on a fly? It takes ten minutes to get these things open!"
S03E21,JERRY,I like the button fly.
S03E21,GEORGE,(incredulous) What?
S03E21,JERRY,That is one place on my wardrobe I do not need sharp interlocking metal teeth. Its like a mink trap down there. (beat) What are you doing today?
S03E21,GEORGE,Nothing.
S03E21,JERRY,"I have to go meet Nina. Want to come up to her lot, check out her paintings?"
S03E21,GEORGE,I dont get art.
S03E21,JERRY,Theres nothing to get.
S03E21,GEORGE,"Well, it always has to be explained to me, and then I have to have someone explain the explanation."
S03E21,JERRY,She does a lot of abstract stuff. In fact she's painting Kramer right now.
S03E21,GEORGE,What for?
S03E21,JERRY,She sees something in him.
S03E21,GEORGE,"So do I, but I wouldn't hang it on a wall."
S03E21,[CUT TO,Nina's studio again--same scene]
S03E21,KRAMER,"Are you getting the eyes? 'Cause they're brown. (beat) Or, really, they're dark brown, like rich, Columbian coffee."
S03E21,NINA,Tell me about Elaine.
S03E21,KRAMER,"She and Jerry were a big thing, like Abe Lincoln and Mary Todd."
S03E21,NINA,"But, they're still friends."
S03E21,KRAMER,"Oh yeah, they're like this (holds up two fingers together)."
S03E21,NINA,Don't you think that's strange?
S03E21,KRAMER,"Why, what's the difference?"
S03E21,NINA,"Well, are you still friends with any of your ex-girlfriends?"
S03E21,KRAMER,"Well, you know... I, uh... have many relationships."
S03E21,[CUT TO,the door outside Nina's studio]
S03E21,GEORGE,"You know, I'm a little nervous."
S03E21,JERRY,Why?
S03E21,GEORGE,"Well, you know... the friend meeting the new woman. I feel like I'm getting fixed up for a friendship."
S03E21,JERRY,I don't know how long this is gonna last.
S03E21,GEORGE,Really? I thought you liked her.
S03E21,JERRY,I do... she's got like a jealousy thing. She doesn't like me having fun with anyone but her. (knocks on the door)
S03E21,GEORGE,"You know, it's a miracle you're not married. (beat) Hey, I'm not obligated to buy anything, am I?"
S03E21,JERRY,"Hi, Nina. (smooch) This is my friend George."
S03E21,NINA,"How nice to meet you, I've heard a lot about you. (George nods)"
S03E21,JERRY,"(walking over to where Kramer is posing) Hey, look at this guy!"
S03E21,KRAMER,Yeah!
S03E21,JERRY,(to Nina) I brought George up to see some of your paintings.
S03E21,NINA,"Oh, are you interested?"
S03E21,GEORGE,"(looking uncomfortable) Um... yeah! Sure, sure I'm interested."
S03E21,KRAMER,"George, you gonna buy a painting?"
S03E21,GEORGE,"(gritting teeth) Yeah, sure."
S03E21,NINA,Are you an art-lover?
S03E21,GEORGE,I am an art-adorer! I adore art.
S03E21,NINA,"Great! Well, take a look around. Pick out something you like. (George reluctantly begins to look around, while Jerry strolls over to the painting-in-progress [Kramer] and picks up a brush.)"
S03E21,JERRY,"May I? (pantomimes making a big ""X"" across the painting)"
S03E21,NINA,"(laughing) Get outta here! (beat) Here, play with this. (hands Jerry a small white envelope)"
S03E21,JERRY,What's this?
S03E21,NINA,"My father gave me four tickets to the Yankee game for Saturday afternoon. Owner's box, first row behind the dugout."
S03E21,JERRY,"(sincerely disappointed) Oh, Saturday... I'm working, I'm going out of town."
S03E21,NINA,"Oh, well. I'm not gonna go without you. Do you guys want 'em?"
S03E21,KRAMER,(immediately) Yeah.
S03E21,JERRY,"They're right behind the dugout, George, first row!"
S03E21,GEORGE,"Behind the dugout, are you kidding? How did you get them?"
S03E21,NINA,"Oh, my father's the Yankees accountant... it's the owner's box."
S03E21,GEORGE,"All my life I've dreamed of sitting front row, behind the dugout!"
S03E21,NINA,"(gesturing towards a small, ugly painting George was apparently look-ing at and happens to be holding) You like that one?"
S03E21,[CUT TO,"Saturday, the game. George, Kramer, and Elaine are being lead to their seats]"
S03E21,GEORGE,Look at where we are! (referring to the seat usher) He's not stopping! He just keeps going and going and going! (the usher abruptly stops at the second row) We're not in the first row?
S03E21,USHER,"No, no, these are your seats."
S03E21,GEORGE,She said first row! Right behind the dugout!
S03E21,ELAINE,"Well, it's the second row. It's just as good."
S03E21,GEORGE,I was all primed for the first row; I was gonna put my feet up on the dugout!
S03E21,ELAINE,Would you shut up? These are great! You can't get any better than this.
S03E21,GEORGE,"Oh, there's better, (pointing at the row in front of them) right there, that's better."
S03E21,KRAMER,"Right. (Elaine giggles) Oh boy... okay, who wants a dog? (Kramer hands out the hot dogs)What a great day!"
S03E21,ELAINE,I could've been at my boss' son's bris right now.
S03E21,GEORGE,(amused) You're supposed to do that?
S03E21,ELAINE,(shrugs) Yeah. (beat) What makes you think anyone would want to go to a circumcision?
S03E21,GEORGE,I'd rather go to a hanging.
S03E21,ELAINE,"Anyway, I called him back... I told him I had to go visit my father in the hospital in Maryland. (George laughs)"
S03E21,KRAMER,"(screaming at the players on the field) YOU BETTER CATCH IT,"
S03E21,MAN,George?
S03E21,GEORGE,Yeah?
S03E21,MAN,"Hi. I'm Leonard West, Nina's father."
S03E21,GEORGE,"Hi! Mr. West, this is my friend Elaine--"
S03E21,ELAINE,Hi!
S03E21,KRAMER,"(screaming again) HEY, 230 AIN'T GONNA CUT IT IN THIS TOWN, BABE!"
S03E21,GEORGE,--and this is Kramer.
S03E21,KRAMER,"Oh, hey."
S03E21,WEST,So how are the seats?
S03E21,GEORGE,Okay.
S03E21,ELAINE,"Great, great."
S03E21,KRAMER,Yeah.
S03E21,WEST,"George, I heard you bought one of Nina's paintings."
S03E21,GEORGE,"Yeah, it's being framed right now. I don't even know what it costs. (beat) Not, uh, too expensive, is it?"
S03E21,WEST,"Well, if you have a lot of money."
S03E21,WEST,"(leaving) Well, enjoy the game. (beat -- to Elaine) I think you better take off that Orioles cap."
S03E21,ELAINE,(thinking he's joking) Yeah. I better!
S03E21,WEST,"No, no, no. Seriously. You're in the owner's box, and I don't think it's a good idea."
S03E21,ELAINE,You're not serious.
S03E21,WEST,"Yes, yes, yes, I am!"
S03E21,ELAINE,"Well, did he say that?"
S03E21,WEST,"No, no, but he gave me the seats. I don't think he'd like it if you wore an Orioles cap."
S03E21,ELAINE,Well maybe you should ask him!
S03E21,WEST,I don't have to ask him! Now are you gonna take the hat off or not?
S03E21,ELAINE,"No! I don't have to take it off, why should I take it off? This is ridiculous!!"
S03E21,GEORGE,Just take the cap off.
S03E21,ELAINE,"George, we are at a baseball game! This is America!"
S03E21,WEST,"Look. Either you take the cap off, or you'll have to leave."
S03E21,ELAINE,"Well, I don't care, I'm not taking it off."
S03E21,GEORGE,Just take the cap off!
S03E21,ELAINE,No!
S03E21,KRAMER,Hey! Just wait a minute. We just got here!
S03E21,GEORGE,(to Elaine) Do you want us to go with you?
S03E21,KRAMER,"(getting up) I'll go get your hat, George."
S03E21,ELAINE,"(sarcastically, to George) Stay!"
S03E21,GEORGE,"Okay, we'll go!"
S03E21,(meanwhile Kramer is climbing over the dugout retrieve George's cap... the camera cuts to the field where the batter hits a pop fly to where Kramer is,"the ball knocks him squarely in the head, he falls off the dugout onto the crowd)"
S03E21,ELAINE,...and then the ball hits him in the head and he falls right over the railing!
S03E21,JERRY,Is he okay?
S03E21,ELAINE,"Well, yeah, he's fine! We took him to the emergency room, and you know, the x-rays were all negative. (beat) It was quite a day!"
S03E21,JERRY,This is the most amazing story I've ever heard--why did he want you to take off the baseball cap? That is so insane!
S03E21,ELAINE,I know! Can you imagine that?
S03E21,JERRY,How you feeling?
S03E21,KRAMER,"Oh, yeah, yeah, I'm fine, I'm fine. (beat--holds up newspaper) Hey, we made the paper. Eh? Look at this- page 2, sports section... we're all in the picture."
S03E21,ELAINE,Wha- a picture?
S03E21,KRAMER,A picture.
S03E21,ELAINE,OUR PICTURE'S IN THERE??
S03E21,KRAMER,Uh-huh.
S03E21,ELAINE,(gasps) I cannot believe this!
S03E21,JERRY,(pointing) There's George!
S03E21,KRAMER,"Yup, yup!"
S03E21,ELAINE,Ohmygod! Lippman could see this! He thinks I was visiting my father! Oh my g-I make up one little white lie and they put my picture in the paper!
S03E21,[CUT TO,"Lippman's office. Lippman is at his desk, Elaine enters.]"
S03E21,ELAINE,"Hi, Mr. Lippman."
S03E21,LIPPMAN,How's your father?
S03E21,ELAINE,"My, my father?"
S03E21,LIPPMAN,"Yeah. You, you went to see him, right?"
S03E21,ELAINE,Yeah.
S03E21,LIPPMAN,Uh-huh.
S03E21,ELAINE,I went to visit him.
S03E21,LIPPMAN,"Uh-huh. So, what was wrong with him?"
S03E21,ELAINE,"Well, you name it, uh, neuritis, uh, neuralgia..."
S03E21,LIPPMAN,But--but he's feeling better now?
S03E21,ELAINE,"Um, yup. Yes, yes, it just... such a miracle, um. My visit must have buoyed (Elaine says ""boyed"") his spirits."
S03E21,LIPPMAN,(correcting her) Boo-eed.
S03E21,ELAINE,What--what did I say?
S03E21,LIPPMAN,"You said ""boyed."""
S03E21,ELAINE,I did?
S03E21,LIPPMAN,Yeah.
S03E21,LIPPMAN,"Well, I got a plane to catch."
S03E21,ELAINE,Oh! Where are you going?
S03E21,LIPPMAN,Going to Houston. It's a publisher's convention. (beat) Can I have my sports section?
S03E21,ELAINE,Ah. ...Yeah.
S03E21,LIPPMAN,I've been saving it for the plane. I never miss the Sunday sports section.
S03E21,ELAINE,"There's nothing to read, it's just yesterday's news. You know, the Yankees won, the Mets lost, Ricky Henderson's unhappy..."
S03E21,LIPPMAN,"Right, right. (starts to take the paper from Elaine's hand; Elaine holds on tight.) What, what are you doing?"
S03E21,ELAINE,"Wha-- oh! (noticing her hand) Oh, god! (laughs) That is the THIRD time today I have done that! BLAAAH! (laughs again) Grabbing news- papers... I'm just tugging at 'em... (laughs)"
S03E21,LIPPMAN,Gotta go.
S03E21,ELAINE,"Okay! Well, you know, have a nice trip, and uh... alrighty! (beat) I'll just hold down the, uh, fort!"

S03E21,[CUT TO,Another part of the studio where Jerry and Nina are arguing.]
S03E21,NINA,She was a guest of my father's. She should've taken the cap off.
S03E21,JERRY,It's preposterous! They ask someone to take off a baseball cap at a baseball game. (beat) How can you defend that?
S03E21,[CUT TO,Armstrongs admiring painting again.]
S03E21,MRS.ARM,"He is struggled, he is man-struggled. He lifts my spirit!"
S03E21,MR. ARM,"He is a loathsome, offensive brute, yet I can't look away."
S03E21,[CUT TO,Jerry and Nina again.]
S03E21,JERRY,"Look, I'm really getting tired off all the fighting. Maybe we should just end this before we really start hating each other."
S03E21,NINA,"Oh, well, you wouldn't want that because you always have to remain friends!"
S03E21,JERRY,"Well, I like to remain friends with people I was friends with!"
S03E21,NINA,"Hey -- why don't you just go then! And -- oh, give this to George. Tell him he owes me $500!"
S03E21,[CUT TO,Armstrongs]
S03E21,MRS.ARM,He transcends time and space.
S03E21,MR. ARM,He sickens me.

S03E21,[CUT TO,Jerry's apartment.]
S03E21,GEORGE,Five-hundred dollars?! What?
S03E21,JERRY,That's what she told me!
S03E21,GEORGE,I'm not paying $500 for this! It's a piece of junk!
S03E21,JERRY,That's what it costs!
S03E21,GEORGE,Why did you even take it? You broke up with her!
S03E21,JERRY,I wasn't thinking! I don't know.
S03E21,GEORGE,You weren't thinking.
S03E21,JERRY,"Well, she framed it and everything."
S03E21,GEORGE,"Well, I'm not buying it. No way. Forget it. No way I'm buying this! (beat) I mean, look at it! What is it? It's a bunch of squiggly lines! (beat) Are you telling me you couldn't paint this?"
S03E21,JERRY,Do you want me to paint you something? I'd love to paint you some- thing!
S03E21,GEORGE,"I'm not paying for this. If you were going out with her, it'd be a different story."
S03E21,KRAMER,"(entering, handing Jerry a piece of paper) This was in front of your door."
S03E21,GEORGE,"Hey, Kramer."
S03E21,KRAMER,"Hi, Mike."
S03E21,JERRY,"(looking at the paper) Wow, a letter from Nina!"
S03E21,KRAMER,"(notices the painting) Whoa, man! That is the ugliest thing I've ever seen!"
S03E21,JERRY,(reading note) Oh my god!
S03E21,GEORGE,What?
S03E21,JERRY,"This is amazing, you can't believe this!"
S03E21,GEORGE,What's it say?
S03E21,JERRY,"Listen to this ""I don't know what you expect to find out there, Jerry, you know what you want better than me. But there's one thing I do know. I know I can stand here watching you destroy everything I've ever wanted in my life, wanting to smash your face with my fists, because you won't make even the slightest effort to offer happiness and still know that I love you. You mean so much to me that I'm will-ing to take all your abuse and insults and insensitivity."""

S03E21,KRAMER,(emotionally) She's deep.

S03E21,JERRY,No one's ever written me a letter like this. Maybe I was wrong about her!

S03E21,JERRY,Should I?
S03E21,KRAMER,"(screaming) YES! YOU'RE DAMN RIGHT YOU SHOULD! (hysterically) Fight for her, Jerry, she's sure as hell fighting for you!"

S03E21,GEORGE,(on intercom) It's George.
S03E21,JERRY,"Come on up. (to Nina) Well, now we gotta get a posse together. I love a good posse."
S03E21,NINA,What's the appeal of the posse?
S03E21,JERRY,"The appeal of the posse? The posse has tremendous appeal. Get away from the job, camp out, you're with your friends... Come on, it's a week-long game of hide-and-seek on horseback."
S03E21,NINA,"Hello, George."
S03E21,GEORGE,"Hey, Nina! (beat) I owe you some money, don't I?"
S03E21,NINA,"Well, I really love that piece."
S03E21,GEORGE,"Oh, yeah, me too, me too. Boy oh boy oh boy...! You know, in fact, I've been thinking about it, and I feel like I'm stealing from you! Five-hundred dollars! It's gonna be worth thousands soon! You know what? On second thought, I can't even accept it."
S03E21,NINA,"No, no no no, George! A deal's a deal. I want you to have it!"
S03E21,GEORGE,This could be in a museum some day! It's not safe with me! It should really be in a doormanned building.
S03E21,NINA,"Honestly, George, the money's not important."
S03E21,GEORGE,Who said anything about money? (intercom buzzes)
S03E21,JERRY,Yeah?

S03E21,NINA,Elaine?
S03E21,JERRY,...Yeah.

S03E21,JERRY,"She likes the pop-in. I've told her how I hate the pop-in. (pointing to George) He likes the pop-in, too."
S03E21,GEORGE,I just popped in now. I'm a big pop-in guy.
S03E21,JERRY,Yeah.
S03E21,GEORGE,How 'bout Kramer.
S03E21,JERRY,HUGE pop-in guy!
S03E21,NINA,"Well, I was leaving anyway, so, uh, we're on for tomorrow?"
S03E21,JERRY,Yeah.
S03E21,NINA,Okay.
S03E21,JERRY,Okay!
S03E21,NINA,"Bye. (just as Nina is about to leave, Elaine walks in.)"

S03E21,ELAINE,You're all over the dial! You don't know what you want! I've never seen you stay on anything for more than 5 seconds. Gimme that.
S03E21,JERRY,Let go!
S03E21,ELAINE,"No, come on! I want it, Jerry!"
S03E21,JERRY,"Let go, Elaine!"
S03E21,ELAINE,Well at least let George do it!
S03E21,JERRY,"Oh, George can't click! (George joins in the fight)"

S03E21,JERRY,"Wait, wait a second! Go back, go back to that. (they watch it a little longer)"
S03E21,ELAINE,"It's Chapter 2, it's Neil Simon."
S03E21,JERRY,"(on to something) Wait a second... wait a second!! (he watches the TV for another minute) The letter, that's the letter!"
S03E21,ELAINE,What letter?
S03E21,JERRY,"This is the letter she wrote to me, she stole it right from the movie!"
S03E21,JERRY,"""...'cause you don't even make the slightest effort to offer happiness still know that I love you!!"""
S03E21,GEORGE,This is incredible!
S03E21,JERRY,"I always thought there was something funny about this letter! She copied it right out of Chapter 2! She a thief, a bunko-artist!"
S03E21,GEORGE,Maybe I won't send her that check.
S03E21,ELAINE,"You know, it's not really that terrible."
S03E21,JERRY,What are you talking about? She completely misrepresented herself! (mimicking the letter) I don't offer happiness. I offer happiness! James Caan doesn't offer happiness!

Alright Lenny, thanks again. Take care. (hangs up the phone, and then, to Elaine) That was Lenny West, my accountant, who is a hell of a guy. And he handles the Yankees too; it's his biggest account. So every once in a while they throw him a couple of seats and last weekend he gave them to his daughter. She's an artist, by the way. Anyway, her daughter gives 'em to some friends, you know. One of her friends shows up wearing a Baltimore cap! (beat) You're from Baltimore, right?"
S03E21,ELAINE,"Um, oh, it's Townscend, which is NEAR Baltimore."

S03E21,ELAINE,"Well, uh, fan. My father--"
S03E21,LIPPMAN,"Anyway, she refused to take the cap off; caused a whole big scene!"
S03E21,ELAINE,Really?
S03E21,LIPPMAN,Yeah.

S03E21,LIPPMAN,Good. (Elaine stars to leave) Oh--and Elaine. You know the Baltimore cap you got in your office? Wear it. I'm gonna have a little fun with him.
S03E21,ELAINE,That will be fun.
S03E21,[CUT TO,"Nina's studio. Nina is working on a painting. Jerry is watching her, sitting on the sofa.]"
S03E21,JERRY,How's it coming?
S03E21,NINA,"Good, good."
S03E21,JERRY,Seen any good movies lately?
S03E21,NINA,No... not really. You?
S03E21,JERRY,"No. I like a good comedy. You know, like a Neil Simon? You like Neil Simon?"
S03E21,NINA,"Neil Simon? Uh, some of his stuff."
S03E21,JERRY,"I've seen MOST of it. I guess my favorite would have to be, uh... Chapter 2. Have you ever seen that?"
S03E21,NINA,I don't know... maybe.
S03E21,JERRY,"I have. Funny, funny. In fact it was on TV just the other night. Happened to catch it. (a knock is heard at the door) I couldn't help notice a STUNNING similiarity-- (Jerry is interrupted as Nina opens answer the door...)"
S03E21,MR. ARM,"Well, we've made our decision. We want ""The Kramer."""
S03E21,[CUT TO,"Jerry's apartment, night. Jerry and George are watching a baseball game and talking.]"
S03E21,GEORGE,Five-thousand? Why would anybody buy Kramer for $5000? (laughs)
S03E21,JERRY,"Boy, the Yankees cannot buy a hit tonight!"
S03E21,GEORGE,So is it all over between you and... Marsha Mason?
S03E21,JERRY,"Yeah. (picks up Nina's painting George bought) And by the way, can you get this thing outta my house?"
S03E21,GEORGE,"Tell you what, I'll make a deal with you. I'll sell it to you right now for ten bucks."
S03E21,TVVOICE,"Uh, there's seems to be a lot of trouble in the area just behind the Yankee dugout."
S03E21,GEORGE,"Behind the dugout, that's where we were sitting the other day."
S03E21,TVVOICE,"Well, we're not going to show it, we don't want to encourage that kind of behavior. Say, it's a young lady, and boy she's really going at it with the security guard. She's a fiesty one. And now they're getting the other security guard to come down. How do you like that Seegers? Boy, she's someting. (beat) And a ball to left field..."""
S03E21,[CUT TO,the Armstrong's dining room. Mr. and Mrs. Armstrong are having Kramer over for dinner.]
S03E21,KRAMER,"...then, when I was seventeen, I ran away from home and hopped a steamship to Sweden. (beat) This steak is excellent, by the way."
S03E21,MRS.ARM,More potatoes?
S03E21,KRAMER,"Yeah, sure. Please."
S03E21,MR. ARM,"Yes, yes. Go on. You hopped a steamship to Sweden?"
S03E21,KRAMER,"Yeah. (beat) And, it was a big one."
S03E22,KRAMER,"Hey. I got some bad news for you, buddy. I think your car got stolen again."
S03E22,JERRY,What are you talking about?
S03E22,KRAMER,"Well you parked it on eighty-fourth and Columbus, right?"
S03E22,JERRY,Yeah.
S03E22,KRAMER,"Yep, well I just walked by there and that car is gone."
S03E22,JERRY,"Oh yeah, I know."
S03E22,KRAMER,"Well, where is it?"
S03E22,JERRY,What's the difference?
S03E22,KRAMER,"Well, there's no difference, you know, I'm just curious."
S03E22,JERRY,"You always have to know everything that's going on, don't you?"
S03E22,KRAMER,What happened to the car?
S03E22,JERRY,"If I don't tell you it will kill you, won't it?"
S03E22,KRAMER,"Yeah, yeah, it'll kill me."
S03E22,JERRY,"You have to know, you must know."
S03E22,KRAMER,I must know.
S03E22,JERRY,"Well, I'm not telling you."
S03E22,KRAMER,"Oh, come on."
S03E22,JERRY,Nope. I don't think so.
S03E22,KRAMER,"Well, please?"
S03E22,JERRY,"Not today, pal."
S03E22,KRAMER,"Okay, I beg you."
S03E22,JERRY,Now see? Just saying beg doesn't make it a real beg. You gotta put some beg into it.
S03E22,KRAMER,"Okay, please! Please tell me!"
S03E22,JERRY,"Alright, I'll tell you, but your begging needs a lot of work."
S03E22,KRAMER,"Okay, okay, what is it? Come on."
S03E22,JERRY,I loaned the car to George.
S03E22,KRAMER,"Ah, George, alright. Well, what for?"
S03E22,JERRY,"George and Elaine went to a flea market in Westchester, okay?!"
S03E22,KRAMER,Alright.
S03E22,JERRY,Huh?
S03E22,KRAMER,"Huh. I mean, what do they want to go there for?"
S03E22,JERRY,Will you stop it already?!
S03E22,KRAMER,"You know, why didn't they ask me to go?"
S03E22,JERRY,I don't know! How am I supposed to know?!
S03E22,KRAMER,"What, they don't like me?"
S03E22,JERRY,*I* don't like you!
S03E22,KRAMER,"If they like me, why don't they ask me to go? Oh yeah."
S03E22,GEORGE,I really think it looks good.
S03E22,ELAINE,"Ten bucks, how can you go wrong?"
S03E22,GEORGE,All bald people look good in hats.
S03E22,ELAINE,"You should have lived in the twenties and thirties, you know men wore hats all the time then."
S03E22,GEORGE,What a bald paradise that must have been. Nobody knew.
S03E22,ELAINE,"Well, you can wear a hat all the time now. Who's stopping you?"
S03E22,GEORGE,"No, I can't. What if I meet a woman? I'd always be worried about that first moment where I'd take it off and see that look of disappointment on her face."
S03E22,ELAINE,Are you sure you like these sunglasses?
S03E22,KRAMER,Well I'm very disappointed in George and Elaine. And you know I'm somebody you don't want to have on your bad side.
S03E22,JERRY,Why not?
S03E22,KRAMER,"Because I'm like ice, buddy. When I don't like you, you've got problems. (notices some snacks on the table) Oh, is this for the fight?"
S03E22,JERRY,Yep. (checks watch) Starts in thirty-five minutes.
S03E22,KRAMER,"Oh hey, you know I invited Mike Moffit. You don't mind, do you?"
S03E22,JERRY,"No, I like Mike."
S03E22,KRAMER,"Yeah, I just got off the phone with him, you know we had a great conversation."
S03E22,JERRY,Oh yeah? What did you talk about?
S03E22,KRAMER,Well actually we talked about you. Yeah. He had some pretty interesting things to say.
S03E22,JERRY,Oh yeah? What did he say?
S03E22,KRAMER,"You have to know everything, don't you?"
S03E22,JERRY,"No, come on, Kramer. What did he say?"
S03E22,KRAMER,Why is that? Why do you have to know everything?
S03E22,JERRY,"Kramer, just tell me what the guy said."
S03E22,KRAMER,Beg me.
S03E22,JERRY,"Please, don't make me beg."
S03E22,KRAMER,"No no no, I want you to beg me. And I don't want you to say it, I just want you to put some beg into it. Go on."
S03E22,JERRY,"Kramer, please tell me what the guy said."
S03E22,KRAMER,"No no no, that's no good. No, I really don't think that's a beg. No, it's close, but uh..."
S03E22,JERRY,Kramer!
S03E22,KRAMER,"Look, I can't say anything. You know, the guy told me the stuff in confidence, I'd be betraying a friend."
S03E22,JERRY,Well you can't just mention it and then not tell me.
S03E22,KRAMER,Alright. I'll tell you but you can't say anything to him.
S03E22,JERRY,"I'm not saying anything, I'm putting it in the vault, I'm locking the vault, it's a vault!"
S03E22,KRAMER,He thinks you're a phony.
S03E22,JERRY,He what?
S03E22,KRAMER,"I told you, he thinks you're a phony."
S03E22,JERRY,A phony? He called me a phony?
S03E22,KRAMER,A big phone. A big one.
S03E22,JERRY,Why did you tell me that if I can't say anything?!
S03E22,KRAMER,You begged me.
S03E22,GEORGE,Do you hear that?
S03E22,ELAINE,Of course I hear that.
S03E22,GEORGE,You had to move the mirror?
S03E22,ELAINE,I wanted to check out my sunglasses.
S03E22,GEORGE,"I went to look in the mirror, it wasn't there. You threw off my equilibrium."
S03E22,ELAINE,"Oh yeah, blame it on me because you can't drive, George."
S03E22,GEORGE,I can't drive?
S03E22,ELAINE,Yeah.
S03E22,GEORGE,"Nobody drives like me. Nobody. I'm doing things in this car, you have no idea they're going on. Wanna see me make a right turn from the left lane? Watch this."
S03E22,ELAINE,"No, I really don't."
S03E22,GEORGE,And I can make a left turn from the right lane too.
S03E22,ELAINE,I'm sure you could.
S03E22,GEORGE,What are we gonna tell Jerry about the car?
S03E22,ELAINE,I don't know.
S03E22,GEORGE,"Alright, start looking for spaces."
S03E22,ELAINE,"Oh, you're never gonna find a space on Jerry's block, just put it in a garage."
S03E22,GEORGE,"Look, I have my system. First I look for the dream spot right in front of the door, then I slowly expand out in concentric circles."
S03E22,ELAINE,"Oh come on, George, please put it in a garage. I don't want to spend an hour looking for a space."
S03E22,GEORGE,I can't park in a garage.
S03E22,ELAINE,Why?
S03E22,GEORGE,"I don't know, I just can't. Nobody in my family can pay for parking, it's a sickness. My father never paid for parking; my mother, my brother, nobody. We can't do it."
S03E22,ELAINE,I'll pay for it.
S03E22,GEORGE,"You don't understand. A garage. I can't even pull in there. It's like going to a prostitute. Why should I pay, when if I apply myself, maybe I could get it for free? (he hears a horn honking) What? What do you want? Go around me, I'm looking for spaces."
S03E22,ELAINE,"(pointing backwards) Oh George, there's a space right there!"
S03E22,GEORGE,"(putting the car in reverse) Oh beautiful! Look at that, the dream space right in front of Jerry's building. Huh? Dreams can come true, what did I tell you?"
S03E22,ELAINE,You didn't even have to take it out to dinner.
S03E22,GEORGE,"Alright, now you're gonna see some parallel parking. (spitting into his hands and rubbing them together) How I wish you could make a living parallel parking. (turning around in his seat) It's all geometry, knowing all the angles, when to make that first turn and then when to swing it back in, that's the key."
S03E22,ELAINE,Will you just park it already?
S03E22,GEORGE,"There's nothing I can even impart to you, that's the sad thing. It's so inborn, I can't pass it on. (begins backing into the space) Look at this guy. Are you crazy, what are you doing?! Hey! Hey, you're stealing my space!"
S03E22,ELAINE,"George, wait, you don't know who this guy is, people kill for a parking space in this city."
S03E22,GEORGE,"No no no, he's not getting away with this."
S03E22,ELAINE,George?
S03E22,GEORGE,"Hey, what are you doing?"
S03E22,MIKE,I think I'm parking my car.
S03E22,GEORGE,"You can't do that, you can't just sneak in from the back like that."
S03E22,MIKE,"I'm not sneaking. I didn't even know you were parking, you were just sitting there three spaces up."
S03E22,GEORGE,"Well if you didn't think I was parking, why did you put it in head first?"
S03E22,MIKE,"Well that's the way I park. Anyway, you didn't start backing in until I pulled in."
S03E22,GEORGE,I was in the middle of a conversation.
S03E22,MIKE,"Hey, buddy, what can I tell you?"
S03E22,GEORGE,The point is I was here first.
S03E22,MIKE,I was closer to this space than you were.
S03E22,GEORGE,But I'm backing in! You can't put it in head first!
S03E22,MIKE,I can if I have room!
S03E22,GEORGE,Are you gonna move the car?
S03E22,MIKE,"No, I'm not gonna move the car."
S03E22,GEORGE,Jerk!
S03E22,MIKE,"Oh, you're not?"
S03E22,GEORGE,Do you believe this guy?
S03E22,ELAINE,"Come on, we'll put it in a garage."
S03E22,GEORGE,"I am not putting it in a garage, it's my space."
S03E22,ELAINE,"What are you gonna do, you just gonna leave it here like this? Uh. I'm going upstairs."
S03E22,GEORGE,Are you coming back down?
S03E22,ELAINE,"Yeah, I gotta tell Jerry we're here. I gotta go to the bathroom."
S03E22,GEORGE,"Alright, just make sure he reserves the good chair for me. Wait, what are you gonna tell him about the clanking noise in the car?"
S03E22,ELAINE,"Me? No no no, you. You're gonna tell him. I'm not gonna tell- Noo."
S03E22,GEORGE,"Oh, come on, you're good at this."
S03E22,ELAINE,What am I gonna say?
S03E22,GEORGE,"I don't know, I don't know, you'll think of something."
S03E22,ELAINE,"Oh god, I need a drink, do you got any Hennigan's here?"
S03E22,JERRY,"Yeah, under the counter. What happened?"
S03E22,ELAINE,"Oh god. Oh, Jerry it was so terrible what we just went through on the way home. (pouring a big shot of scotch) You wouldn't believe it. (pushing a bag of chips off the counter)"
S03E22,JERRY,(bending down to pick up the chips) Tell me what happened.
S03E22,ELAINE,"(after pouring the shot in the sink while Jerry was distracted and pretending to have downed it) Okay. Now listen. We were at the toll booth at the Henry Hudson Parkway, okay?! And there were these, like, this pack of extremely wild teenagers in a convertible behind us, okay?! And for some reason, I don't know, they just started to taunt us! And so then we payed the toll, and then we went through, and then they started to follow us, alright?! So George tries to lose them, and, and, but they were in this really like a souped up car, you know?! And so he turned off the road really suddenly and the car was on two wheels and I was just screaming! And then, George is such a great driver."
S03E22,JERRY,He is?
S03E22,ELAINE,"Oh, he is fantastic! And then they fired a gun right up in the air."
S03E22,JERRY,A gun?!
S03E22,ELAINE,"I think it was a gun. And then they followed us all the way into the city, and then they just stopped and they turned around and they went home."
S03E22,JERRY,"My god, are you okay?"
S03E22,ELAINE,"Yeah, yeah, I'm alright. Oh, by the way, the car hit a pothole and now it's making a clanking noise."
S03E22,JERRY,"Well, I mean, as long as you're okay, that, that's the important thing."
S03E22,ELAINE,Exactly.
S03E22,JERRY,Where's George now?
S03E22,ELAINE,"Oh, he's out in front of the building. He's arguing with some guy about a parking space."
S03E22,JERRY,What are you talking about?
S03E22,ELAINE,"Look out the window, you'll see."
S03E22,JERRY,(leaning out the window) Hey Georgie!
S03E22,GEORGE,Hey!
S03E22,JERRY,Are you okay?
S03E22,GEORGE,"Yeah, I'm fine."
S03E22,JERRY,"Crazy kids, huh?"
S03E22,GEORGE,What?
S03E22,ELAINE,(desperate to distract Jerry) Ow!! (Jerry looks over) It's my cuticle.
S03E22,MIKE,Is that Jerry? Jerry?!
S03E22,JERRY,"Oh, hey Mike."
S03E22,GEORGE,"What, you know Jerry?"
S03E22,MIKE,"Yeah, I know Jerry."
S03E22,GEORGE,How do you know him?
S03E22,MIKE,What's the difference?
S03E22,GEORGE,"Because I know him too, and probably a lot better than you."
S03E22,MIKE,"Well, bully for you. Hey, Jerry! You know your friend here's a real piece of work!"
S03E22,JERRY,I'm coming down.
S03E22,MIKE,"Hey, will you tell Kramer I'm outside?"
S03E22,GEORGE,"What, you know Kramer?!"
S03E22,ELAINE,Hi.
S03E22,KRAMER,(acting standoffish) Hello.
S03E22,JERRY,"Hey, your friend Mike's outside, he wants to talk to you."
S03E22,KRAMER,"(out the window) Hey, Mike! Come on up, the fight's almost starting!"
S03E22,GEORGE,And you're watching the fight at Jerry's?
S03E22,MIKE,Yeah.
S03E22,GEORGE,Oh great.
S03E22,ELAINE,You know that guy downstairs?
S03E22,JERRY,"Yeah, he's a real phony."
S03E22,KRAMER,What's going on?!
S03E22,MIKE,"Hey, will you come on down? This guy's in my space!"
S03E22,GEORGE,It's my space!
S03E22,KRAMER,I'll be down in a minute.
S03E22,ELAINE,Are you going down?
S03E22,KRAMER,Yeah.
S03E22,ELAINE,Is anything wrong?
S03E22,KRAMER,(leaving) Why should anything be wrong?
S03E22,ELAINE,(heading for the bathroom) Be down in a minute.
S03E22,MIKE,"Hey pal, you're not getting that space. I mean, I'll sleep in my car if I have to."
S03E22,GEORGE,I'll die out here.
S03E22,BYSTANDER #1,"He was down there. Once he passed his front bumper, it's no longer his space."
S03E22,BYSTANDER #2,"No, it doesn't matter. He was-"
S03E22,MIKE,Hey! Jerry! Long time no see!
S03E22,JERRY,Hi Mike. (Noticing George's fedora) Indiana.
S03E22,MIKE,Hey Krame! You know this guy?
S03E22,KRAMER,"Yeah, yeah, I know him."
S03E22,MIKE,(to Jerry) You're looking tremendous. What are you on some kind of regimen?
S03E22,JERRY,"Yeah, twenty-five percent bran flakes. The forty percent was too much so I found a store to mix it up special for me, they take it down another fifteen percent."
S03E22,MIKE,"(laughing way too loud and hard) Ha ha ha ha!!! That's killer! Killer! I love that! Ha ha ha!!! You gotta use that, that's a definite!! Ha ha ha!!!"
S03E22,GEORGE,"Oh, come on."
S03E22,MIKE,Hey! Your friend here has some real problems.
S03E22,GEORGE,"Me? You see what he did here, you see how he tried to sneak into my space?"
S03E22,MIKE,"Hey, just 'cause I went in front first doesn't mean I'm sneaking in."
S03E22,GEORGE,You only went in front first 'cause you saw me backing up and you didn't have room to parallel park!
S03E22,MIKE,I only went in front first 'cause I could make it in front first and if you pull out I'll show you!
S03E22,GEORGE,You've got a prayer.
S03E22,KRAMER,I go in front first all the time.
S03E22,JERRY,"Front first, that's how you park when you're pulling a bank job."
S03E22,GEORGE,Did you talk to him?
S03E22,ELAINE,"Yeah, it's all taken care of."
S03E22,GEORGE,You told him? What did you tell him?
S03E22,ELAINE,"I did a number on him, it was a thing of beauty, you really had to have been there to appreciate it."
S03E22,GEORGE,"I don't believe it, what did you say?"
S03E22,ELAINE,I told him a pack of teenagers in a convertible were terrorizing us and they followed us into the city.
S03E22,GEORGE,A pack of teenagers?
S03E22,ELAINE,"Yeah, by the time I got to the end of the story, he was to relieved that we were alive he couldn't care less about the car."
S03E22,GEORGE,"You are a genius, it's as simple as that."
S03E22,ELAINE,"What can I say, you know? It's a gift. I only wish I could teach it but, you know it's inborn."
S03E22,KRAMER,"By the way, thanks a lot for inviting me to the flea market."
S03E22,ELAINE,What?
S03E22,KRAMER,"Yeah, Jerry, he told me all about it."
S03E22,GEORGE,Oh great.
S03E22,JERRY,I didn't know.
S03E22,ELAINE,"Oh, so that's why you were acting so funny."
S03E22,GEORGE,Well I didn't know you wanted to go to the flea market.
S03E22,MIKE,A flea market? You went to a flea market??
S03E22,GEORGE,"Hey, who's talking to you?"
S03E22,ELAINE,We just didn't think of you.
S03E22,KRAMER,"You said it, sister."
S03E22,GEORGE,What? Every time I leave my house now I have to call everybody I know and ask them if they want to do what I'm doing?
S03E22,GEORGE,"Great move, telling him, by the way, real smart move."
S03E22,JERRY,I didn't know I wasn't supposed to say anything!
S03E22,GEORGE,"Judgement, Jerry, judgement! You exercised no judgement."
S03E22,JERRY,You're right. My fault.
S03E22,ELAINE,"Kramer? I'm so sorry, really."
S03E22,GEORGE,"Yeah, I'm sorry."
S03E22,KRAMER,"I'm sorry, I don't care for that sorry."
S03E22,GEORGE,"What was wrong with that sorry? It was a good sorry. Jerry, was that a good sorry?"
S03E22,JERRY,It was a so-so sorry.
S03E22,TRUCK DRIVER,"Hey! Move this car, I gotta get through!"
S03E22,GEORGE,You heard the man. I guess you gotta be moving your car.
S03E22,MIKE,And like you're not gonna just back it in if I do that?
S03E22,TRUCK DRIVER,Well somebody better move something soon! I got a truck full of ice cream here!
S03E22,ELAINE,"You see, they had to move the cars so the truck could get through, right? But these guys don't trust each other so they got these two nonpartisan drivers to move them."
S03E22,JERRY,"Wild pack of teenagers, huh?"
S03E22,GEORGE,Yeah.
S03E22,JERRY,"Amazing how they picked you, out of everyone, to terrorize."
S03E22,ELAINE,"Yeah. I know, I said to myself, 'Why us?' You remember?"
S03E22,GEORGE,Uh huh.
S03E22,JERRY,"Sounds like you did some pretty nifty maneuvering,"
S03E22,GEORGE,"Well, you know, It's interesting, you know, under that pressure, what you're capable of."
S03E22,ELAINE,Right.
S03E22,GEORGE,I learned a lot about myself.
S03E22,JERRY,What did you do to my car?!
S03E22,GEORGE,"I couldn't help it! Elaine moved the mirror, I got discombobulated."
S03E22,ELAINE,"Oh, like you've ever been bobulated."
S03E22,JERRY,I thought you said you were a good driver!
S03E22,GEORGE,"No no, I never said I was a good driver, I said I was a good parker."
S03E22,JERRY,I think you said driver.
S03E22,GEORGE,"Parker, I never said driver, I said parker, a great parker."
S03E22,MIKE,Will you move it up a little bit?
S03E22,GEORGE,"No no no, that's in the right position."
S03E22,MIKE,"No no, I was further in."
S03E22,GEORGE,"No you weren't. Stop there, that's fine."
S03E22,MIKE,Do you mind?
S03E22,GEORGE,Do you?
S03E22,SID,"Hey, somebody better move these cars, you're making a commotion."
S03E22,JERRY,Hey Sid.
S03E22,MIKE,Who are you?
S03E22,SID,"Never mind who I am. I know who I am. Do you know who you are? (to George) Why is it every time you park a car in this block, everything gets disrupted and disjointed?"
S03E22,GEORGE,"Sid, it's completely his fault."
S03E22,MIKE,"Oh, right."
S03E22,SID,Why don't you start taking the bus?
S03E22,JERRY,"Okay, George. Come on, let's go. I'm putting it in a garage. The fight's starting in two minutes."
S03E22,GEORGE,Don't do it!
S03E22,JERRY,"What are we gonna do, stay out here all night?"
S03E22,GEORGE,"Yes! I'm not giving him the satisfaction, it's my space."
S03E22,ELAINE,Why don't you just flip a coin already?
S03E22,GEORGE,"No no, this is a matter of principle. That would just be saying that anybody could just pull into any parking space any way they want. Well I'm making a stand here. I'm saying *no* to head first parking. I'm not putting up with that. We put up with too much crap in this city, we're not putting up with head first parking."
S03E22,ELAINE,"You know, maybe if you hadn't been sitting there pontificating about what a great parker you were, you might have got the space."
S03E22,GEORGE,So you're against me now?
S03E22,ANGRY MAN,"He could have pulled up to the car and backed in, but he chose to go in head first."
S03E22,MATTHEW,"No he couldn't, because the other car was already backing in."
S03E22,ANGRY MAN,No he wasn't.
S03E22,MATTHEW,All that matters is who was there first.
S03E22,ANGRY MAN,"Ahh, you're not even old enough to drive, you little puke."
S03E22,MATTHEW,You just spit on me!
S03E22,ANGRY MAN,Don't you raise your voice to me!
S03E22,MATTHEW,You're not my father.
S03E22,JERRY,Hey Matthew.
S03E22,MATTHEW,Hi Jerry. This guy's really a jerk.
S03E22,JERRY,How ya doing?
S03E22,MATTHEW,Okay.
S03E22,JERRY,"Hey, how's your father? I hear he's closing his store."
S03E22,MATTHEW,What?!
S03E22,JERRY,"Oh no, nothing."
S03E22,MATTHEW,What's happened to daddy? He's going out of business?
S03E22,JERRY,"No, no, no, no."
S03E22,MATTHEW,We're not going to have any money? We're out of money?
S03E22,JERRY,"No, of course not, of course not!"
S03E22,MATTHEW,Mommy!? Jerry says daddy's closing the store. He's going out of business. We don't have any money?
S03E22,MARYEDITH,Jerry?! What's the matter with you?
S03E22,JERRY,I didn't--
S03E22,MARYEDITH,"(to Kramer) Boy, I don't know about your friend, Jerry. He says some pretty stupid things sometimes."
S03E22,KRAMER,"Oh, congratulations."
S03E22,MARYEDITH,What for?
S03E22,KRAMER,"Well, you're pregnant."
S03E22,MARYEDITH,What?
S03E22,KRAMER,You're not pregnant?
S03E22,MARYEDITH,"No, I'm not pregnant."
S03E22,KRAMER,Are you sure you're not pregnant?
S03E22,MARYEDITH,"Yes, I'm sure!"
S03E22,KRAMER,That's weird.
S03E22,MARYEDITH,"Come on, Matthew."
S03E22,MATTHEW,No.
S03E22,MARYEDITH,"Come on, Matthew!"
S03E22,KRAMER,I thought she was pregnant.
S03E22,JERRY,"(to Elaine) Hey, do you think I'm phony?"
S03E22,ELAINE,What?
S03E22,JERRY,Mike thinks I'm a phony.
S03E22,ELAINE,He thinks you're a phony?
S03E22,JERRY,"Yeah, but I can't say anything because Kramer wasn't supposed to tell me."
S03E22,ELAINE,"Oh, you have to say something."
S03E22,JERRY,"I can't, I told Kramer I was vaulting it."
S03E22,ELAINE,You gotta open the vault.
S03E22,JERRY,Open my vault?
S03E22,ELAINE,Open your vault.
S03E22,JERRY,"Once I open the vault, it ceases to be a vault."
S03E22,ELAINE,You have no choice.
S03E22,JERRY,Oy ga-vault.
S03E22,Newman,(to Kramer) You wanna know why you can't go in front first? I'll tell you why. because it signals a breakdown in the social order. Chaos. It reduces us to jungle law.
S03E22,KRAMER,When can you park head first?
S03E22,NEWMAN,Never.
S03E22,MIKE,What are you asking this guy for?
S03E22,NEWMAN,Who's talking to you?
S03E22,GEORGE,He's right. never.
S03E22,MIKE,Oh yeah? What if you got ten car lengths? You have to pull all the way up to the front car?
S03E22,NEWMAN,"Well, I suppose if you got ten car lengths."
S03E22,GEORGE,When do you ever have ten car lengths?
S03E22,KRAMER,What about Sundays and holidays?
S03E22,GEORGE,Oh please.
S03E22,SHEILA,What's going on here?
S03E22,GEORGE,"Oh, this guy tried to sneak into my space."
S03E22,SHEILA,I really hate people who do that. I hope you don't let him get away with it.
S03E22,GEORGE,"Well, thank you for your support."
S03E22,SHEILA,"Hey, that's a great hat."
S03E22,GEORGE,Really? You like it? I got it at a flea market today.
S03E22,NEWMAN,"Hey George, nice hat."
S03E22,GEORGE,"Yeah, thanks."
S03E22,NEWMAN,Can I try it on?
S03E22,GEORGE,"No! It, uh, it wouldn't fit you."
S03E22,NEWMAN,Well sure it would.
S03E22,GEORGE,"No! Get out of here, Newman."
S03E22,NEWMAN,"Come on, let me try it on."
S03E22,GEORGE,"No, Newman, stop it."
S03E22,SHEILA,Let him try it on.
S03E22,GEORGE,I don't want him to!
S03E22,SHEILA,What is wrong with you?
S03E22,GEORGE,"You wanna see?! (pulling off the hat to reveal the bald pate) There! There it is! (turning to Newman) Alright, here! You wanna try on the hat?! Here! Try on the hat!"
S03E22,NEWMAN,"Stop it, George, stop it. I was defending your parking."
S03E22,GEORGE,"Alright, just keep the hat!"
S03E22,JERRY,"Alright, that's it. The fight's already started. I'm going upstairs, who's coming? Elaine?"
S03E22,ELAINE,It depends on who's going. (to George) Are you going?
S03E22,KRAMER,I'm not going if he's going.
S03E22,NEWMAN,Me either.
S03E22,GEORGE,I'm not going if he's going.
S03E22,MIKE,Well I'm going.
S03E22,JERRY,Well if he's going then I'm not going.
S03E22,NEWMAN,But it's your house.
S03E22,JERRY,I still don't have to go.
S03E22,ELAINE,Well I don't want to go if Jerry's not going.
S03E22,MIKE,Why won't you go if I go?
S03E22,JERRY,Why? I'll tell you why.
S03E22,KRAMER,"No. Don't, Jerry."
S03E22,JERRY,Like you didn't call me a phony?
S03E22,MIKE,"What? (to Kramer) Thanks! Real good! Jerry! First of all, I think you completely misunderstood what I said. I meant it in a complementary way. I mean, you know when people say, 'He's bad', it really means he's good, sort of thing? You know, slang."
S03E22,JERRY,Use it in a sentence.
S03E22,MIKE,"Man, that Michael Jordan is so phony. (to Kramer) Why'd you tell him?!?"
S03E22,KRAMER,He begged me.
S03E22,MIKE,He begged you?!
S03E22,JERRY,"Alright, come on. Who wants to watch the fight?"
S03E22,COP #1,"Okay, who's cars are these? Let's move 'em. Let's go."
S03E22,GEORGE,"Officer, could I just explain something to you?"
S03E22,COP #1,Hey. Let's go or I'm gonna write both of you a ticket in about two minutes.
S03E22,GEORGE,"Officer, he can't pull in head first."
S03E22,MIKE,"Officer, he backed up from down the street. He was double-parked, he was"
S03E22,COP #1,"Alright, you move your car. It's his space, you can't go in head"
S03E22,COP #2,Wait a second. Why can't he go in head first? He said the guy was just sitting over there.
S03E22,COP #1,What are you talking about? This guy was here first.
S03E22,COP #2,But he didn't take it.
S03E22,COP #1,"Hey, it's his space."
S03E22,COP #2,"No, it's his space."
S03E22,GEORGE,"Well, you're gonna have to go to the bathroom!"
S03E22,MIKE,"Well, you're gonna have to go to work!"
S03E22,GEORGE,I don't have a job!
S03E22,MIKE,Neither do I!
S03E22,REFEREE,Seven... Eight... Nine... Ten. *ding*
S03E23,Jerry's stand-up,"So, I fly a lot. I like planes. I was on a plane the other day and I was wondering - are there keys to the plane? Do they need keys to start the plane? Maybe that's what those delays on the ground are sometimes. When you're just sitting there at the gate, maybe the pilot's just up there in the cockpit going (mimics looking for keys) ""Oh, I don't believe this. Oh my god...I did it again."" They tell you it's something mechanical, because they don't want to come on the PA system...""Ladies and gentlemen, we're going to be delayed here on the ground for a little while, I uh...Oh God, this is so embarrassing...I - I left the keys to the plane in my apartment."" You see the technicians all running underneath the plane; you think they're servicing it, but they're actually looking for the magnet ""hide-a-key"" under the wing...""maybe he left it up there somewhere..."""
S03E23,Opening scene,Jerry's apartment in the middle of the night. Jerry comes out of his room. We hear his thoughts.
S03E23,JERRY's brain,"What is it about sleep that makes you so thirsty? Do dreams require liquid? It's not like I'm running a marathon, I'm just lying there."
S03E23,JERRY's brain,What the hell...? Why is the door open?
S03E23,JERRY,"Kramer, what are you doing here!?"
S03E23,KRAMER,"Jerry, now calm down, it's okay. I'm sorry. I didn't want to wake you up! Y'know, I was watching ""Thirty Seconds Over Tokyo,"" and I - y'know, I wanted to get some popcorn, and I, uh...I used the spare keys that you gave me to come into your apartment to get your popper."
S03E23,JERRY,You scared me!
S03E23,KRAMER,It's just me.
S03E23,JERRY,That's enough!
S03E23,KRAMER,"Forgot the popper... (goes to the kitchen, grabs the popper, drops the lid, juggles it around, then exits.)"
S03E23,JERRY (from outside the door),C'mon...c'mon...
S03E23,JERRY,Kramer! What are you doing?!
S03E23,KRAMER,What does it look like I'm doing? What?
S03E23,JERRY,"Get out! Get out of the bathroom, I gotta go!"
S03E23,KRAMER,"Alright, alright..."
S03E23,JERRY,C'mon!
S03E23,KRAMER,Sorry.
S03E23,JERRY,Move it! Move it! Get going!
S03E23,KRAMER,"My drain's all clogged up! (Comes out of the bathroom in a towel, covered in soap suds.)"
S03E23,JERRY (from inside the bathroom),Is that my towel?
S03E23,GIRLFRIEND,I'm really happy the movie was sold out.
S03E23,JERRY,"Hey, did you ever pretend there's like, murderers chasing you, and you try and see how fast you can get your keys out and get into your apartment?"
S03E23,GIRLFRIEND,"I'm from Witchita, so..."
S03E23,JERRY,Oh. I see. There he is! (Pretends the murderers are coming.)
S03E23,GIRLFRIEND,"Hurry, Jerry! He's coming! Hurry!"
S03E23,JERRY,The murderers! (Jerry unlocks his door and they both run inside.)
S03E23,GIRLFRIEND,That was close!
S03E23,JERRY,Did you see the look on that guy's face?
S03E23,GIRLFRIEND,"You were so fast with those keys. (They prepare to kiss, but are interrupted by Kramer and his girlfriend coming out of Jerry's bedroom, laughing and horsing around.)"
S03E23,JERRY,Kramer! What the hell are you doing here?!
S03E23,KRAMER,"Hey, Jerry! How are ya? I thought you were going to the movies."
S03E23,JERRY,"All right, that's it. Hand 'em over."
S03E23,KRAMER,What?
S03E23,JERRY,"What, you know what, the keys. I want the keys. You've lost your key privileges."
S03E23,KRAMER,"Oh, come on!"
S03E23,JERRY,"No, come on!"
S03E23,KRAMER,"What, what, I thought you went to the movies!"
S03E23,JERRY,It was sold out!
S03E23,KRAMER,Now how was I supposed to know it was going to be sold out?
S03E23,JERRY,That's the point.
S03E23,KRAMER,What point?
S03E23,JERRY,"Just, look, just give the keys."
S03E23,KRAMER,Just give me another chance!
S03E23,JERRY,Don't ask me!
S03E23,KRAMER,I'm asking you!
S03E23,JERRY,I'm telling you.
S03E23,KRAMER,You're joking.
S03E23,JERRY,I'm serious!
S03E23,KRAMER,It's not going to happen again!
S03E23,JERRY,"Yes it will, now give me those keys!"
S03E23,KRAMER (getting up),"O.K., fine, go ahead, you take the keys! But you're going to regret this. (He angrily storms out. Kramer then re-enters seconds later when he realizes he's left his girlfriend in Jerry's apartment.)"
S03E23,JERRY,So put 'em in a safe place.
S03E23,ELAINE,I will.
S03E23,JERRY,Where?
S03E23,ELAINE,"I don't know. I'll hide 'em. So, is Kramer upset?"
S03E23,JERRY,"I think so. I mean, he's acting really weird lately...he's different."
S03E23,ELAINE,"Well, maybe you should just give him the keys back."
S03E23,JERRY,I can't.
S03E23,ELAINE (mouths the words),Is that Kramer? (Jerry nods.)
S03E23,JERRY,Who's there?
S03E23,KRAMER (in hallway),"Uh, Kramer. (Jerry opens the door, Kramer enters. Elaine waves at Kramer with the keys in her hand.) Oh, hi...uh...you got the..."
S03E23,ELAINE,"Oh, I'm not, uh..."
S03E23,KRAMER,"No, no, no, it's o.k. I don't care about the keys. It's my fault. I gave the keys away with my stupidity. I broke ""the covenant of the keys."""
S03E23,ELAINE,"Jerry, give him the keys back."
S03E23,JERRY,Elaine...
S03E23,KRAMER,"I don't want the keys back! No, I'm glad the way things turned out. I was clingin' to those keys, man! Like a branch on the banks of a raging river. And now I have let go. And I'm free...to go with the current. To float. (To Jerry) And I thank you."
S03E23,JERRY,Take the keys.
S03E23,KRAMER,"I don't want the keys! (Jerry tries to force the keys on Kramer, but Kramer refuses.)"
S03E23,JERRY,O.K.!
S03E23,KRAMER,"Now, one more thing - I would like my keys back."
S03E23,JERRY,Your spare set?
S03E23,KRAMER,That's right.
S03E23,JERRY,You want 'em back?
S03E23,KRAMER,"Yeah. Yeah, I think it would be for the best."
S03E23,GEORGE,"Gee, Kramer, I uh...I don't know what to say."
S03E23,KRAMER,"Say yes! Yes, George. Yes!"
S03E23,GEORGE,"Should I give you my keys, is that the transaction, trading keys...? Because Elaine has my keys."
S03E23,KRAMER,"Well, you can get 'em back."
S03E23,GEORGE,I suppose I could.
S03E23,KRAMER,"Because you see, George, having the keys to Jerry's apartment? That kept me in a fantasy world. Every time I went over to his house, it was like I was on vacation. Better food, better view, better TV. And cleaner? Oh - much cleaner. That became my reality. I ignored the squalor in my own life because I'm looking at life, you see, through Jerry's eyes. I was living in twilight, George. Living in the shadows. Living in the darkness...like you."
S03E23,GEORGE,Me?
S03E23,KRAMER,"Oh, yeah. I can barely see you, George."
S03E23,GEORGE,"Alright, stop it Kramer, you're freakin' me out. (The waitress comes over.)"
S03E23,WAITRESS,"Hi, are you ready to order? (George tries to order, but Kramer interrupts.)"
S03E23,KRAMER (moves over and sits next to George),Do you ever yearn?
S03E23,GEORGE,Yearn? Do I yearn?
S03E23,KRAMER,I yearn.
S03E23,GEORGE,You yearn.
S03E23,KRAMER,"Oh, yes. Yes, I yearn. Often, I...I sit...and yearn. Have you yearned?"
S03E23,GEORGE,"Well, not recently. I craved. I crave all the time, constant craving...but I haven't yearned."
S03E23,KRAMER (in disgust),Look at you.
S03E23,GEORGE,"Aw, Kramer, don't start..."
S03E23,KRAMER (moving back to the othe side of the booth),You're wasting your life.
S03E23,GEORGE,"I am not! What you call wasting, I call living! I'm living my life!"
S03E23,KRAMER,"O.K., like what? No, tell me! Do you have a job?"
S03E23,GEORGE,No.
S03E23,KRAMER,You got money?
S03E23,GEORGE,No.
S03E23,KRAMER,Do you have a woman?
S03E23,GEORGE,No.
S03E23,KRAMER,Do you have any prospects?
S03E23,GEORGE,No.
S03E23,KRAMER,You got anything on the horizon?
S03E23,GEORGE,Uh...no.
S03E23,KRAMER,Do you have any action at all?
S03E23,GEORGE,No.
S03E23,KRAMER,Do you have any conceivable reason for even getting up in the morning?
S03E23,GEORGE,I like to get the Daily News!
S03E23,KRAMER,"George, it's time for us to grow up - and be men. Not little boys."
S03E23,GEORGE,Why?
S03E23,KRAMER,"I'm goin' to California. You know, I got the bug."
S03E23,GEORGE,"Yeah, I think I got a touch of something, too."
S03E23,KRAMER,"No, the acting bug. Ever since I was in that Woody Allen movie."
S03E23,GEORGE,"""These pretzels are making me thirsty""? That was one line! You got fired!"
S03E23,KRAMER,"I know, I know, but man! I never felt so alive! Now, are you coming with me?"
S03E23,GEORGE,"Uh, no, I'm not."
S03E23,KRAMER,"Alright, suit yourself. But let's keep this between us - we're key brothers now. (Gets up to leave.)"
S03E23,GEORGE,"You're not really gonna go to California, are you?"
S03E23,KRAMER (points to his head),"Up here, I'm already gone. (Kramer exits.)"
S03E23,GEORGE,"Anyway, so he gave me his spare keys, now he wants to have my keys, so I need mine back from you."
S03E23,ELAINE,Just 'cause you have his keys? Why does he need yours?
S03E23,GEORGE,"I don't know. He said he wants to be my ""key brother."""
S03E23,ELAINE,That's ridiculous.
S03E23,GEORGE (shakes huge keyring),That's Kramer.
S03E23,ELAINE,I'll give you back your spare keys - but now I want mine back.
S03E23,GEORGE,What for?
S03E23,ELAINE,'Cause. I'll give 'em to Jerry.
S03E23,GEORGE,Jerry? Why?
S03E23,ELAINE,'Cause he gave me his.
S03E23,GEORGE,So what?
S03E23,ELAINE,"So, if he has my keys, I should have his."
S03E23,GEORGE,"Well, I don't see why if you have his, he should have yours."
S03E23,ELAINE,I just said the same thing to you.
S03E23,GEORGE,What?
S03E23,ELAINE,What?
S03E23,GEORGE,"Alright, listen, I'll give you your spare keys, but I don't have them with me. Can I please have mine to give to back to Kramer?"
S03E23,ELAINE,"Yeah, O.K. I'll go get 'em. (George begins to leaf through papers on Elaine's counter.) What are you doing? Would you just put that down? (Takes the papers away from George.) I gotta get some new friends."
S03E23,JERRY,Did you bring the keys?
S03E23,GEORGE,"Yes, but I still don't feel right about letting you into Kramer's apartment without his permission."
S03E23,JERRY,This could be an emergency!
S03E23,GEORGE,You never should have taken away his keys!
S03E23,JERRY,"I tried to give 'em back, he wouldn't take 'em. (Jerry and George go out into the hallway to Kramer's apartment.)"
S03E23,GEORGE,How'd the Mets do?
S03E23,JERRY,They lost.
S03E23,JERRY,Kramer?
S03E23,NEWMAN (startling them),"Hello, boys."
S03E23,JERRY,"Hello, Newman."
S03E23,NEWMAN,You lookin' for someone?
S03E23,JERRY,"Don't play coy with me, Newman, I'm not in the mood!"
S03E23,NEWMAN,Coy? I'm not being coy.
S03E23,JERRY (to George),Is he being coy?
S03E23,GEORGE,"Yeah, coy."
S03E23,JERRY,"You're being coy. Now where's Kramer, Newman?"
S03E23,NEWMAN (coyly),Who?
S03E23,JERRY,"Listen, Tiny. I wanna know where Kramer is and wanna know now!"
S03E23,NEWMAN,"Alright, go ahead and hit me, Seinfeld. I got witnesses."
S03E23,JERRY,"Turn around, George."
S03E23,GEORGE,Sure. (Turns around.)
S03E23,NEWMAN,George?
S03E23,JERRY,"Now, you better tell me where Kramer is, or are we gonna have to do this the hard way? (Hits wall with his fist.)"
S03E23,NEWMAN,Help! Help!
S03E23,JERRY,Where's Kramer?
S03E23,NEWMAN,HELP! (Elaine enters.)
S03E23,ELAINE,What's going on?
S03E23,NEWMAN,They're gonna beat me up!
S03E23,GEORGE,No we're not.
S03E23,JERRY,We're trying to find out what happened to Kramer.
S03E23,NEWMAN,"You wanna know what happened to Kramer? I'll tell you what happened to Kramer. He was ticked off. About the keys. Yeah, that's right - about the keys. Thought he got a bad rap."
S03E23,JERRY,Bad rap?
S03E23,NEWMAN,Yeah. From you.
S03E23,JERRY,Me?
S03E23,NEWMAN,You heard me. So he packed it up and split for the coast. La-La Land. L.A.
S03E23,JERRY,L.A.?
S03E23,JERRY,"I never should have taken his keys away. But he drove me to it! I had no choice! He wouldn't take 'em back. Elaine, you saw it, remember? I said, 'Take the keys back.' He wouldn't do anything. You saw it, didn't you see it?"
S03E23,ELAINE,"Yeah, yeah, I saw it. (mutters under her breath) I mean, it's complete bullshit."
S03E23,JERRY,Huh?
S03E23,ELAINE,What...?
S03E23,JERRY,"No, what'd you say?"
S03E23,ELAINE,Nothing. I didn't say anything.
S03E23,JERRY,"Oh, you didn't see it."
S03E23,ELAINE,"Yeah, I saw it. I saw it! I did, I saw it. Yep."
S03E23,JERRY,"I heard you say something, there."
S03E23,ELAINE,I didn't say anything.
S03E23,JERRY,"I'm calling Kramer's mother. (Picks up the phone, dials.) (To Elaine) I don't know what you said. But it was something. I heard something. Hello? Hello, Mrs. Kramer? Mrs. Kramer? Could you turn the music down? Could you turn the music down!"
S03E23,GEORGE,Ask her about Kramer.
S03E23,JERRY,She's drunk out of her mind.
S03E23,JERRY (leaving a message on Elaine's machine),"Elaine? Are you there? It's me, I'm locked out of my apartment, I need my spare keys. Where are you? I'm at the coffee shop."
S03E23,KRAMER (shouting over the cycle's engine),Hey! You ever been in an accident?
S03E23,BIKER,"About five years ago. I was going down this very road. Same time of day, going about the same speed I'm going now...there was a rock in the road. Couldn't have been more than a pebble. Never really saw it! Lost control of the bike, went flyin' about a hundred feet - came down right on my head. Cracked it wide open! Blood and stuff was just splattered all over the road, there...I broke every bone in my face. Hey, you know, when they found me, my eyes were hanging out of their sockets? Yeah, they pronounced me dead at the scene. I was in a coma for...well, they told me about a year...said I'd be a vegetable for life. Yeah, but I showed 'em. Ever since then I always wear a helmet! (The biker goes into a turn.) Lean! (Kramer yells.)"
S03E23,JERRY (applauding),"Georgie Boy! Way to come through with the keys! Sit down, I'm buying you dinner."
S03E23,GEORGE,"Look, I gotta tell ya...I been thinkin' about it, I just don't feel right about letting you into Elaine's apartment."
S03E23,JERRY,Don't feel right? What are you talking about?
S03E23,GEORGE,"Well, you know, I shouldn't have let you into Kramer's, now you want to go into Elaine's...she entrusted me with her spare keys, how can I just let you in?"
S03E23,JERRY,What is the big deal?
S03E23,GEORGE,"Just because you have someone's spare keys, it doesn't entitle you to break into their apartment. That's the reason you took away Kramer's keys."
S03E23,JERRY,"First of all, you're not even supposed to have Elaine's keys. You're supposed to give 'em back to her, so she can give 'em back to me, because she has mine. So technically, those are my keys."
S03E23,GEORGE,"Yes, well, if you had never taken your keys back from Kramer, he never would have taken his back from you and given 'em to me, in which case I wouldn't have had to take mine back from her."
S03E23,JERRY,"Well, I want those keys. (Tries to grab the keys from George.)"
S03E23,GEORGE,"Nope, no can do."
S03E23,JERRY,"George, give them to me, I want these keys. (They struggle over the keys.) I don't want to get physical!"
S03E23,GEORGE,Do you wanna fight?
S03E23,JERRY,Do you wanna fight?
S03E23,GEORGE,I'll fight ya! Not the face! Not the face! (The struggle continues.)
S03E23,KRAMER,"And then, the evil ogre took back the magical keys from the handsome young prince."
S03E23,HIPPIE #1,"Oh no. He didn't take back the keys, no way."
S03E23,KRAMER,"Yes! And then the handsome young prince was cast out into the cruel, cruel world."
S03E23,HIPPIE #1,"Oh man, what a bummer. That ogre dude's pretty cold, huh?"
S03E23,KRAMER,"Oh, he's cold."
S03E23,HIPPIE #1,"Lemme tell you something, Kramer. If that ogre dude pulled that crap on me (pulls out a knife) - I'D STAB HIM! I'D CUT HIM IN HALF! I'D GUT HIM LIKE A FISH, MAN! That's what I'd do!"
S03E23,KRAMER,"Yeah, yeah...that'd be funny. (To driver) Hey, you can drop me here!"
S03E23,HIPPIE #1,"Hey, what's the rush, man?"
S03E23,KRAMER,"Well, you know, I gotta be goin' now."
S03E23,HIPPIE #1,"Hey, Kramer - have you ever killed a man?"
S03E23,KRAMER,"What do you think, junior? You think these hands have been soakin' in Ivory liquid? (mimics choking somebody)"
S03E23,HIPPIE #2,"Don't leave, Kramer, stay with us. You know so much about the world, we need you, please Kramer! (they all start chanting) Please, Kramer! Please, Kramer! (Scene ends with Kramer trying to escape their clutches.)"
S03E23,JERRY,"Don't you see? You're just avoiding the middle man. You were gonna give her her spare keys, so she was gonna give 'em to me. So, all that's happening is that instead of giving them to her, you're giving them to me. It's just unfortunate that when she gave you yours, you didn't give her hers. 'Cause then she would have given 'em to me, because she has mine. So then I would have never had to ask you for hers, so that I could get mine."
S03E23,GEORGE,"You're right, how did I miss that? (Begins unlocking the door, mutters under his breath) Maybe because it's a crock of shit."
S03E23,JERRY,What's that?
S03E23,GEORGE,Nothing.
S03E23,JERRY,I heard something.
S03E23,GEORGE,Didn't say anything. (They go into Elaine's apartment.)
S03E23,KRAMER,"So, how long you been drivin' this thing?"
S03E23,WOMAN,Goin' on four years.
S03E23,KRAMER,"Well, nothin's sexier than a woman behind the wheel of a semi."
S03E23,WOMAN,"Nothin'? (They exchange a glance, then laugh.) Listen to you, you're quite the sweet-talker."
S03E23,KRAMER,"You know, I always wanted to drive the big rigs. I used to watch those commercials during the reruns of Gomer Pyle."
S03E23,WOMAN,You want to give it a try?
S03E23,KRAMER,Really?
S03E23,WOMAN,Do you know how to double-clutch?
S03E23,KRAMER,Yeah.
S03E23,WOMAN,"Well, come on! (They trade places and Kramer gets behind the wheel. Kramer turns out to be really rusty on the ol' double-clutch.)"
S03E23,GEORGE,"They were in here, I saw her put 'em in here!"
S03E23,JERRY,"Well, this is great."
S03E23,GEORGE,"Well, what do they look like?"
S03E23,JERRY,"They look like keys, George. They look exactly like keys. (In disgust) ""What do they look like."""
S03E23,GEORGE,"Well, they're obviously not here."
S03E23,JERRY,"Well, they've gotta be here somewhere."
S03E23,GEORGE,"Jerry, unless I pull down on this statuette and a hidden wall opens up, we have checked every square inch of this apartment!"
S03E23,JERRY (looking through some papers on the desk),"What is this? ""Murphy Brown""?"
S03E23,GEORGE,What?
S03E23,JERRY,By Elaine Benes?
S03E23,GEORGE,What?
S03E23,JERRY,"Elaine's writing a ""Murphy Brown""?"
S03E23,GEORGE,Lemme see this. (Tries to grab the papers.)
S03E23,JERRY,Wait a second! (They fight over the paper.)
S03E23,GEORGE,Gimme half!
S03E23,JERRY,"All right, here!"
S03E23,GEORGE,Why didn't she tell us?
S03E23,JERRY (making fun),Elaine is writing a sitcom...! (Elaine enters the room behind Jerry and George. Jerry spots her and tosses his half of the script at George. George throws it back and paper goes flying everywhere.)
S03E23,ELAINE,You weasels!
S03E23,JERRY,What? What?
S03E23,ELAINE,How dare you!
S03E23,GEORGE,We hardly read anything!
S03E23,JERRY,It was funny!
S03E23,ELAINE,Who gave you permission to come into my house and just go through all my things? You thought it was funny?
S03E23,JERRY,Well... (picks up some of the pages) From what I saw...
S03E23,ELAINE (grabs the papers from Jerry),"Well, it's just a first draft!"
S03E23,JERRY,"I was locked out of my apartment, I'm just trying to get my keys."
S03E23,ELAINE (turning on George),Why did you let him in?! (Shoves George.)
S03E23,GEORGE,He forced me to!
S03E23,JERRY,I did not!
S03E23,GEORGE,Yes you did!
S03E23,ELAINE,You! Get out! Get out! Get out!
S03E23,JERRY,"Elaine, wait! I need my spare keys!"
S03E23,ELAINE,"Here! Here's your damn keys, you keep 'em! I don't want 'em anymore!"
S03E23,JERRY,Good!
S03E23,ELAINE (to George),And I want my keys back from you!
S03E23,GEORGE,"What, you don't want me to hold your keys?"
S03E23,ELAINE,"No, you can't be trusted!"
S03E23,GEORGE,"Alright, alright, fine. (Gives the keys to Elaine.)"
S03E23,JERRY (to Elaine),And I don't want you to hold mine!
S03E23,ELAINE,Good! I won't!
S03E23,JERRY,Good! Don't! Are these my keys?
S03E23,ELAINE,These aren't my keys!
S03E23,GEORGE,Whose are these?
S03E23,ELAINE,I don't know!
S03E23,ELAINE,I just thought I could write it.
S03E23,JERRY,Is that something you want to do?
S03E23,ELAINE,I don't know. Those writers make a lot of money.
S03E23,JERRY,"Elaine, let me tell you something about show business. It's hard work! You don't just write a ""Murphy Brown."" You gotta watch the show, study it, get a sense of the characters, how they relate to each other."
S03E23,ELAINE,"O.K., can I just watch the show? (mutters under her breath) God, what an asshole."
S03E23,JERRY,What did you say?
S03E23,ELAINE,I didn't say anything.
S03E23,JERRY,"I heard something. (Looks at the TV) Elaine, Elaine! It's Kramer! Kramer's on ""Murphy Brown""!"
S03E23,ELAINE (laughing),"Kramer's on ""Murphy Brown""!"
S03E23,JERRY,"Look, there he is, he's sittin' at the desk!"
S03E23,CANDICE BERGEN,"Hi, I'm Murphy Brown, you must be my new secretary."
S03E23,KRAMER,"Oh, good morning, Miss Brown."
S03E23,CANDICE BERGEN,And you are...?
S03E23,KRAMER,"Oh, I'm uh, Steven Snell."
S03E23,CANDICE BERGEN,"Snell. Well, hello, Mr. Snell."
S03E23,KRAMER,Steven.
S03E23,CANDICE BERGEN,Steven. Are you familiar with this computer system?
S03E23,KRAMER,Oh - I'm familiar with it.
S03E23,CANDICE BERGEN,Steven Snell? I know people...and I have a very good feeling about you. (exits.)
S04E01,GEORGE,Kramer was on Murphy Brown?
S04E01,JERRY,Yeah.
S04E01,GEORGE,Are you sure?
S04E01,JERRY,Yeah.
S04E01,GEORGE,"Murphy Brown, the TV show."
S04E01,JERRY,"C'mon, will ya?"
S04E01,GEORGE,Kramer was on Murphy Brown? That son of a gun!
S04E01,JERRY,"Something, isn't it?"
S04E01,GEORGE,With Candace Bergen!
S04E01,JERRY,I know!
S04E01,GEORGE,I've always liked her. Remember her in 'Carnal Knowledge'?
S04E01,JERRY,Sure.
S04E01,GEORGE,Did she show her breasts in that?
S04E01,JERRY,She's not really the naked type.
S04E01,GEORGE,I can't believe I missed Kramer. You know he asked me to go with him to California.
S04E01,JERRY,He did?
S04E01,GEORGE,"Yeah, I turned him down."
S04E01,JERRY,How come you didn't tell me?
S04E01,GEORGE,He asked me to keep it a secret.
S04E01,JERRY,But you can never keep a secret.
S04E01,GEORGE,I know. This was like a record. My previous record was when Joni Hirsch asked me not to tell anybody that we slept together. Kept a lid on that for about 28 seconds.
S04E01,JERRY,"Well, you've come a long way."
S04E01,GEORGE,I've matured.
S04E01,JERRY,"Hey listen, the Tonight Show called me, they want me to come out and do the show on the 28th and they're giving me two free tickets to LA. You wanna go?"
S04E01,GEORGE,A free ticket?
S04E01,JERRY,"Yeah, in fact we could track down Kramer. I always felt bad about the way he left, you know? That was a mess. I never should have taken back those keys."
S04E01,GEORGE,What about accommodations?
S04E01,JERRY,All taken care of.
S04E01,GEORGE,"Is there a meal allowance? What about seat assignments? Could I have the Kosher meal? I hear the Kosher meal is good. And I need clothes. Gotta get a haircut. Gonna have to, I have to refill my allergy medication. Oh, do I need a hat? I need a hat, don't I? Could we do the Universal tour? They have that Backdraft exhibit now, that looks very cool to me..."
S04E01,KRAMER,"So my acting technique, my personal acting technique is working with color, imagining color, then finding the emotional vibrational mood connected to the color. See, if you look through my scripts, you'll see that all my lines have a special color, so I don't memorize language, I memorize color. This way I can go through red, yellow, green, blue. And I have a full palette of emotions."
S04E01,STUDIO GUARD,"Hey, didn't I tell you to get out of here?"
S04E01,KRAMER,"Uh, did you?"
S04E01,STUDIO GUARD,"C'mon, let's go."
S04E01,KRAMER,"Well, I was just--"
S04E01,STUDIO GUARD,"Yeah yeah, you were just nothing. C'mon, let's go."
S04E01,KRAMER,"Alright, we'll talk about this a little later. Are you an actor?"
S04E01,VOICE,Murphy Brown.
S04E01,KRAMER,"Uh, yeah, uh, Candace Bergen please."
S04E01,VOICE,Who's calling please?
S04E01,KRAMER,"Ah, well, just tell her that it's Kramer."
S04E01,KRAMER,"Alright I'll uh, I'll call her at home. (To man waiting behind him) Go ahead, it's all yours."
S04E01,HELENA,Hello Kramer.
S04E01,KRAMER,"Oh, uh, Helena, how are you?"
S04E01,HELENA,"I haven't worked since 1934, how do you think I am?"
S04E01,KRAMER,"Well, that's only uh, 58 years."
S04E01,HELENA,"It was a Three Stooges short, ""Sappy Pappy."" I played Mr. Sugarman's secretary, remember?"
S04E01,KRAMER,"Yeah, right, right, yeah, yeah, that was a Shemp, right?"
S04E01,HELENA,"No, a Curly. The boys played three sailors who find a baby, the baby's been kidnapped and the police think that they did it."
S04E01,KRAMER,"Uh huh, right."
S04E01,HELENA,"But, but of course they didn't do it, the police had made an awful mistake."
S04E01,KRAMER,Right.
S04E01,HELENA,"Moe hits Curly with an axe,"
S04E01,KRAMER,Uh huh.
S04E01,HELENA,"The Stooges catch the kidnappers,"
S04E01,KRAMER,Right.
S04E01,HELENA,But it's too late.
S04E01,KRAMER,Really.
S04E01,HELENA,The baby's dead.
S04E01,KRAMER,Really?
S04E01,HELENA,The boys are sent to Death Row and are executed.
S04E01,KRAMER,Well I don't remember that part.
S04E01,HELENA,I play Mr. Sugarman's secretary.
S04E01,KRAMER,"Oh, yeah, yeah, you were, you were very good."
S04E01,HELENA,"Yeah, it was sad for a Three Stooges, what with the dead baby and the Stooges being executed and all."
S04E01,KRAMER,"Well, that was an unusual choice for the stooges."
S04E01,HELENA,"Would you like to buy me a fat-free frozen yogurt at the store, Kramer?"
S04E01,KRAMER,"Uh, well, uh, you know I can't right now, you know, uh, I got a very big meeting, I got these people interested in my movie treatment. So, uh, I guess we'll have to make it another time, alright?"
S04E01,HELENA,"Well No! No, don't go out there, Kramer, they'll hurt you, they'll destroy you. You'll never make it in this town, you're too sensitive like me,"
S04E01,KRAMER,"Helena, you're wrong, you know I'm not that sensitive at all."
S04E01,HELENA,I was engaged to Mickey Rooney! He left me at the altar. Kramer! Kramer!
S04E01,JERRY,What is this?
S04E01,GEORGE,What?
S04E01,JERRY,"We're going on a two day trip, what are you, Diana Ross?"
S04E01,GEORGE,I happen to dress based on mood.
S04E01,JERRY,Oh. But you essentially wear the same thing all the time.
S04E01,GEORGE,"Seemingly. Seemingly. But within that basic framework there are many subtle variations, only discernable to an acute observer, that reflect the many moods, the many shades, the many sides of George Costanza."
S04E01,JERRY,(referring to George's outfit) And what mood is this.
S04E01,GEORGE,This is Morning Mist.
S04E01,LT. COLEMAN,"What do you figure, 20? 21?"
S04E01,LT. MARTEL,Close enough.
S04E01,LT. COLEMAN,Forensics ought to be able to nail it down.
S04E01,LT. MARTEL,No ID?
S04E01,LT. COLEMAN,No ID.
S04E01,LT. MARTEL,No witnesses?
S04E01,LT. COLEMAN,"Just the trees, Johnny. Pretty young thing."
S04E01,LT. MARTEL,She was. Not any more. Somebody saw to that.
S04E01,LT. COLEMAN,"Sure did, Johnny. Damn shame too. What do you make of it?"
S04E01,LT. MARTEL,"I don't know, but I don't like it."
S04E01,JERRY,"Look at this guy, he's like a cat burglar. He thinks if he goes through real slow the machine won't detect him."
S04E01,GEORGE,Personally I'm a little nervous about going through these things. I'm afraid I'm gonna step through into another dimension.
S04E01,JERRY,Just go.
S04E01,GEORGE,"Heh he, I made it."
S04E01,SECURITY GUARD,Empty your pockets please.
S04E01,SECURITY GUARD,Walk through again please.
S04E01,SECURITY GUARD,Are you sure you don't have any metal on you? Bracelets? Rings? Anklets?
S04E01,JERRY,Anklets?
S04E01,SECURITY GUARD,A lot of men wear anklets.
S04E01,JERRY,Really?
S04E01,SECURITY GUARD,Yeah.
S04E01,OTHER SECURITY GUARD (to George),"What do you have in your bag, sir?"
S04E01,GEORGE,My bag?
S04E01,SECURITY GUARD,Step over here please.
S04E01,JERRY,Over here?
S04E01,OTHER SECURITY GUARD,Do you have a knife in the bag?
S04E01,GEORGE,A knife?
S04E01,OTHER SECURITY GUARD,"Open the bag, please."
S04E01,OTHER SECURITY GUARD,What's this?
S04E01,GEORGE,Moisturizer?
S04E01,OTHER SECURITY GUARD,For your wife?
S04E01,GEORGE,"No, I uh... I use it."
S04E01,SECURITY GUARD,Spread your arms and legs please.
S04E01,JERRY,"(facing the lengthening line behind him) Ladies and gentlemen, I implore you."
S04E01,OTHER SECURITY GUARD,Have a good trip.
S04E01,SECURITY GUARD,"Alright, go ahead."
S04E01,JERRY,That's it?
S04E01,SECURITY GUARD,That's it.
S04E01,JERRY,Alright.
S04E01,GEORGE,"C'mon Jerry, let's go. What was that all about?"
S04E01,JERRY,I must have iron rich blood.
S04E01,GEORGE,"Here we go, LA."
S04E01,JERRY,"The Coast,"
S04E01,GEORGE,"La-la Land. I got the window seat, right?"
S04E01,JERRY,Who said that?
S04E01,GEORGE,I called it.
S04E01,JERRY,Oh no.
S04E01,GEORGE,"What do you mean, oh no."
S04E01,KRAMER,"Oh ah, yeah, I'm here for the audition."
S04E01,RECEPTIONIST,"Which audition, the music video, the horror movie, the exercise tape or the infomercial?"
S04E01,KRAMER,"Uh, let's see... well."
S04E01,KRAMER,You scream good.
S04E01,CHELSEA,You too.
S04E01,CHELSEA,"So, can I keep this treatment?"
S04E01,KRAMER,"Oh yeah, yeah, I got 20 copies."
S04E01,CHELSEA,"'Cause I can, uh, show it to my manager. He has connections with West German television money."
S04E01,KRAMER,Really.
S04E01,CHELSEA,"Yeah, they're trying to put together a miniseries for me on Eva Braun. I mean think about it, is that a great idea? We know nothing about Eva Braun, only that she was Hitler's girlfriend."
S04E01,KRAMER,Um-hm.
S04E01,CHELSEA,What was it like having sex with Adolf Hitler? What do you wear in a bunker? What did her parents think of Hitler as a potential son-in-law? I mean it could just go on and on...
S04E01,KRAMER,"Wait wait, hold it, hold it. Look who's over there. Don't look, don't look! It's Fred Savage."
S04E01,CHELSEA,Big deal.
S04E01,KRAMER,"He'd be perfect for my movie. This is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity. (takes a deep breath) I gotta go over there, I gotta give him a copy of my treatment."
S04E01,CHELSEA,Why are you breathing so hard?
S04E01,KRAMER,"Well, I'm just a little nervous. OK, I gotta relax. Phew. Wish me luck, huh?"
S04E01,KRAMER,"Hey. Oh, did I frighten you? I'm not crazy. I mean, I may look weird, but I'm just like you, I'm just a regular guy just trying to make it in this business. You know I really like your work, the, uh..."
S04E01,FRED SAVAGE,Thank you.
S04E01,KRAMER,"Yeah, I can't remember the name of it."
S04E01,FRED,Thanks.
S04E01,KRAMER,"Yeah, my mind's a blank, I'm sorta nervous, you know, uh..."
S04E01,FRED,"That's ok. Relax, relax."
S04E01,KRAMER,"Ok, but I got this..."
S04E01,KRAMER,"Stupid table. You know, I'm not normally like this, usually I'm very cool and charming, I don't mean to bother you or anything but I think it's fate that you happened to be here at the same time as me."
S04E01,FRED (a little frightened and backing away towards the door),"Yeah, its fate, you know, can't avoid your fate."
S04E01,KRAMER,I got this treatment I think you'll be great in.
S04E01,FRED,Yeah.
S04E01,KRAMER,So I'd like to give it to you.
S04E01,FRED,"Yeah, thank you, thanks a lot. Bye!"
S04E01,KRAMER,"(bumping into a lamp) Alright, excuse me. Uh wait, wait."
S04E01,JERRY,"Yeah, Kramer. K-R-A-M-E-R. Uh, I don't know, wavy? George, how would you describe Kramer's hair?"
S04E01,GEORGE,Curly.
S04E01,JERRY,Wavy.
S04E01,GEORGE,What'd you ask me for?
S04E01,JERRY,"Yeah, I'll hold on. Hey George, did you see a piece of paper I had on the nightstand here, like crumpled up, like a napkin?"
S04E01,GEORGE,Nope.
S04E01,JERRY,"'Cause I had like three jokes on it, they were all perfectly worded just the way I wanted to have it. Can't find it. Hello?"
S04E01,GEORGE (from the bathroom),"Hey, a shoe buffing machine!"
S04E01,JERRY,"I don't know, 6-3, George, how tall is Kramer?"
S04E01,GEORGE,"You got your own shampoo, conditioner, body lotion! Jerry, body"
S04E01,JERRY,About 6-3.
S04E01,GEORGE,"Ooh, a shower cap!"
S04E01,JERRY,Coming.
S04E01,LUPE,Hello. I have more towels.
S04E01,GEORGE,"Oh good, good, come in. Come in, welcome. I'm George. And this is Jerry, over there, on the phone, that's Jerry. And you are, um?"
S04E01,LUPE,Lupe.
S04E01,GEORGE,"Lupe. That's very nice, very nice. Listen, are you going to be making up the bed in the morning?"
S04E01,LUPE,Oh Yes.
S04E01,GEORGE,Fine. Excellent. Could you do me a favor? Could you not tuck the blankets in? 'Cause I can't sleep all tucked in.
S04E01,LUPE,"Oh, yes, yes."
S04E01,GEORGE,"Yes, I like to just be able to take the blankets and swish them and swirl them, you know what I mean? You know, I don't like being all tucked in. I like to have a lot of room, you know I like to have my toes pointed up in the air. Just like to scrunch up the blankets."
S04E01,LUPE,"Yes, yes. It's too tight to sleep."
S04E01,GEORGE,"Exactly, you know what I'm talking about, right?"
S04E01,LUPE,"Oh yees, It's too tight. (Gesturing towards Jerry) Him too?"
S04E01,GEORGE,"Uh, Jerry, you want your blankets tucked in?"
S04E01,JERRY,"Excuse me, what?"
S04E01,GEORGE,You want your blankets tucked in?
S04E01,JERRY,What blankets?
S04E01,GEORGE,When Lupe makes up the beds in the morning.
S04E01,JERRY,"I don't know, whatever they do."
S04E01,LUPE,I tuck in? Yes?
S04E01,JERRY,"Tuck in, tuck in."
S04E01,GEORGE,"Alright, so that's one tuck and one no-tuck."
S04E01,LUPE,Okay.
S04E01,GEORGE,"Yeah. One second sweetheart. Jerry, I really think it'd be easier if you didn't tuck."
S04E01,JERRY,"Excuse me, fine, you don't want me to tuck, put me down for a no-tuck."
S04E01,GEORGE (to Lupe),Two no-tucks.
S04E01,JERRY,"Uh, hang on a second, You know what? Changed my mind, make it a tuck."
S04E01,GEORGE,You just said you weren't tucking.
S04E01,JERRY,I'm tucking! Hello? Hello? They hung up on me. They don't know where Kramer is anyway.
S04E01,GEORGE,"Alrighty, so. That's one tuck and one no-tuck. Got that?"
S04E01,JERRY,"Excuse me, um, did you see a piece of paper on the nightstand here earlier today crumpled up like a napkin?"
S04E01,LUPE,"Oh, yes, yes. I throw away when we clean the room."
S04E01,JERRY,"Oh, okay, thanks."
S04E01,LUPE,Thank you.
S04E01,GEORGE,Thank you.
S04E01,LUPE,Bye-bye.
S04E01,GEORGE,"Alright, Lupe, bye-bye now."
S04E01,LUPE,Bye.
S04E01,GEORGE,Bye-bye.
S04E01,JERRY,"I can't believe she threw that out. I had like the perfect wording of a whole joke I was gonna do about the X-ray counter at the airport, I was gonna do it on the Tonight Show, now I can't remember it."
S04E01,GEORGE,"Well what did you want her to do, you left it on the night table."
S04E01,JERRY,They're not supposed to just take everything and throw it out!
S04E01,GEORGE,"Hey, hey, hey! It's not Lupe's fault, you shouldn't have left it out."
S04E01,JERRY,"Alright, just get your thing together and let's get out of here."
S04E01,GEORGE,"Alright, now. What mood am I in, what mood am I in?"
S04E01,GEORGE,You shouldn't have tucked.
S04E01,JERRY,I like it tucked.
S04E01,GEORGE,Nobody tucks anymore.
S04E01,OFFICER,"Hey, Lieutenant."
S04E01,LT. MARTEL,Yeah.
S04E01,OFFICER,This was found on her person.
S04E01,LT. MARTEL,On her person? What kind of expression is that?
S04E01,OFFICER,"I don't know, sir. Police lingo."
S04E01,LT. MARTEL,"Oh yeah? What's your name, son."
S04E01,OFFICER,Ross.
S04E01,LT. MARTEL,"Ross. Do you see that person there, Ross?"
S04E01,OFFICER,Yes sir.
S04E01,LT. MARTEL,She's dead. Have you got that?
S04E01,OFFICER,Yes sir.
S04E01,LT. MARTEL,Good. Now get out of here before you find yourself on transit patrol writing tickets to senior citizens with fake bus passes.
S04E01,OFFICER,Yes sir.
S04E01,LT. MARTEL,I think we just caught a break.
S04E01,GEORGE,"This is very exciting! You're on the Tonight Show, NBC, who else is on the show?"
S04E01,JERRY,I don't know.
S04E01,GEORGE,Might meet a celebrity.
S04E01,JERRY,I can't believe she threw out my napkin.
S04E01,GEORGE,"What are you worried about, you know it."
S04E01,JERRY,You gonna be alright here?
S04E01,GEORGE,"Yeah yeah yeah yeah, go. Go about your business, I'll just wander around."
S04E01,JERRY,"Alright, don't wander too far, I'll meet you back here in fifteen minutes."
S04E01,GEORGE,"Go, go, go, don't worry about it."
S04E01,GEORGE,Hey. (pointing at him) Corbin Bernsen.
S04E01,CORBIN BERNSEN,How ya doing?
S04E01,GEORGE,Big fan! Big fan.
S04E01,CORBIN BERNSEN,Yeah.
S04E01,GEORGE,"Hey, you grew a beard, huh?"
S04E01,CORBIN BERNSEN,"Yeah, yeah. I'm doing a movie during my hiatus."
S04E01,GEORGE,"Hey. You know, do I have a case for you guys to do on L.A. Law."
S04E01,CORBIN BERNSEN,Really.
S04E01,GEORGE,"...so mind you, at this point I'm only going out with her two or three weeks. So she goes out of town and she asks me to feed her cat. So at this time, there's a lot of stuff going on in my life and, uh, it slips my mind for a few days. Maybe a week. Not a week, five, six days."
S04E01,CORBIN BERNSEN,Yeah yeah yeah. So what happened?
S04E01,GEORGE,"Well, it's the damnedest thing. The cat dies. So she comes back into town, she finds the cat lying on the carpet stiff as a board."
S04E01,CORBIN BERNSEN,So you killed the cat.
S04E01,GEORGE,"That's what she says. I say, listen. It was an old cat. It died of natural causes. So get this, now she tells me that I gotta buy her a brand new cat. I say listen, honey. First of all, it was a pretty old cat. I'm not gonna buy you a brand new cat to replace an old dying cat. And second of all, I go out to the garbage, I find you a new cat in fifteen seconds. I say, you show me an autopsy report that says this cat died of starvation, I spring for a new cat. So she says something to me, like, uh, I dunno, get the hell out of here, and she breaks up with me. Now don't you think that would be a great case on L.A. Law?"
S04E01,GEORGE,I don't wanna tell you how to run your show.
S04E01,GEORGE WENDT,"Oh, of course not."
S04E01,GEORGE,"But really, it's enough with the bar already."
S04E01,GEORGE WENDT,"Yeah, well."
S04E01,GEORGE,"Seriously, have they though about changing the setting?"
S04E01,GEORGE WENDT,"Doubt it, I doubt it. Yeah."
S04E01,GEORGE,"Really? Because people do meet in places besides a bar, huh?"
S04E01,GEORGE WENDT,"Well yeah, they do, heh heh."
S04E01,GEORGE,What about a rec room? Huh? Or a community center.
S04E01,"GEORGE WENDT (checking his watch, obviously uncomfortable)","Yeah, you oughta write one of those."
S04E01,GEORGE,Yeah?
S04E01,GEORGE WENDT,"Yeah, I'll bring it up with the producers, I gotta... uh..."
S04E01,GEORGE,"Fabulous, I'll think about that George, thank you!"
S04E01,JERRY,How's it going?
S04E01,GEORGE,Great! Great! I actually just had two meaningful intelligent conversations with Corbin Bernsen and George Wendt.
S04E01,JERRY,Really?
S04E01,GEORGE,"Yeah, yeah, not fan talk, not gushing, you know? Actual conversation, I was incredibly articulate!"
S04E01,JERRY,You got toilet paper on your heel there.
S04E01,Announcer,"It's the Tonight Show with Jay Leno. Tonight Jay welcomes Corbin Bernsen, George Wendt and comedian Jerry Seinfeld."
S04E01,CORBIN BERNSEN,"Oh yeah, yeah, people are always coming up to me trying to give me a great case for L.A. Law, just a few seconds ago, right here, right outside in the hallway this nut, some sick nut comes up to me and says he's supposed to watch this girl's cat while she's away out of town. Anyway he forgets to feed the cat, the cat dies, starves to death, he kills the cat, refuses to get her a new one, won't give her any money, won't pay her, and he wants Arnie Becker to represent him. Nice guy. Yeah, that'd make a *great* case for L.A. Law. Thanks a lot."
S04E01,HELENA,"He's a very handsome man. Passionate, intense, but troubled, strange. I think he may be in love with me. Of course there's nothing abnormal about that, I have many suitors."
S04E01,GEORGE WENDT,"It's funny, 'cause even after all these years, we still get people giving us advice, how to improve the show. Actually, a few moments ago I ran into a nut back there, he said, you know, that maybe we should think about, you know, not doing the show in a bar."
S04E01,THE FREAK,"So that's when I said, ""Hey, Kramer, dude. You ever killed a man before?"" And he said, ""What do you think, Junior? These hands have been soaking in Ivory liquid?"
S04E01,GEORGE WENDT,"The guy you talked to, what did he look like?"
S04E01,CORBIN BERNSEN,Short little bald guy with glasses.
S04E01,GEORGE WENDT,"Yeah, yeah, that's the same guy I talked to."
S04E01,CORBIN BERNSEN,"It never ends, does it?"
S04E01,JERRY,"So I'm going through the airport and I have to put my bag on that little uh, uh, the uh, that uh, the conveyor belt."
S04E01,LT. MARTEL,"Issue an arrest warrant, put out an APB. Let's pick up this, uh, Kramer."
S04E01,JERRY,I was terrible.
S04E01,GEORGE,"What are you, crazy? You were fine."
S04E01,JERRY,"Nah, did you hear the end? I couldn't remember what I was trying to say, that whole thing about the, uh..."
S04E01,GEORGE,Conveyor belt.
S04E01,JERRY,Yeah. Because she threw out my napkin.
S04E01,GEORGE,"I can't believe, you're blaming Lupe?"
S04E01,JERRY,"Yes, Lupe. I'm blaming Lupe."
S04E01,TV NEWSCASTER,"Our top story tonight, there has been a break in the so called 'Smog Stranglings'. Police have just released a photo of the suspect being sought in connection with the slayings. He is known only as ""Kramer""."
S04E02,GEORGE,"He's on the lamb(?), he's on the loose!"
S04E02,JERRY,"Would you let go of my arm?! I'm trying to drive, you're getting us both killed!"
S04E02,GEORGE,"What are we supposed to do? What do you do on a situation like this? Should we call a lawyer, should we call the police?"
S04E02,JERRY,Obviously we're gonna call the police and tell that he's not the guy.
S04E02,GEORGE,Hope he's not the guy.
S04E02,JERRY,Couldn't be the guy...nah.
S04E02,GEORGE,"God, I'm starved, I'm weak from hunger."
S04E02,JERRY,How can you think of food at the time like this?
S04E02,GEORGE,Time like what? I'm hungry. My stomach doesn't know that Kramer's wanted.
S04E02,JERRY,"I told you to have breakfast, you should've had breakfast!"
S04E02,GEORGE,"I couldn't have breakfast, it was lunchtime! The three hour time difference threw me. I wanted a tuna fish sandwich, they wouldn't serve me tuna fish sandwich, because they were only serving breakfast."
S04E02,JERRY,You should've had some eggs.
S04E02,GEORGE,For lunch? Who eats eggs for lunch?
S04E02,JERRY,Have you ever heard of egg salad?
S04E02,GEORGE,Why didn't you say something then?
S04E02,JERRY,I've gotta to tell you about existence of egg salad?
S04E02,GEORGE,"I need food, Jerry. I feel faint, I'm getting light headed."
S04E02,JERRY,"I've gotta call the police, there's a pay phone over there."
S04E02,GEORGE,"Pay phone in L.A., look it's a miracle."
S04E02,JERRY,I don't have any change. You've got any change?
S04E02,GEORGE,"No, I don't have any change. I never carry change."
S04E02,JERRY,"Well, we need change and all I have is twenties."
S04E02,GEORGE,I have a ten.
S04E02,JERRY,"So, break it."
S04E02,GEORGE,I hate asking for change. They always make a face. Like I'm asking them to donate a kidney.
S04E02,JERRY,"So, buy something."
S04E02,GEORGE,What?
S04E02,JERRY,"I don't know, some mints or TicTacs."
S04E02,GEORGE,Breath problem?
S04E02,JERRY,"No, I just want some change."
S04E02,GEORGE,Tell me.
S04E02,JERRY,"Your breath is fine. It's delightful, it's delicious."
S04E02,GEORGE,"You know, I haven't eaten anything."
S04E02,JERRY,I just wanna call the police!
S04E02,GEORGE,Why don't you just call 911?
S04E02,JERRY,But is this an emergency?
S04E02,GEORGE,Of course it is.
S04E02,JERRY,How is this an emergency?
S04E02,GEORGE,Your friend is been accused of being a serial killer. I think that qualifies.
S04E02,JERRY,"All right, I'll call 911. Think he did it? Could've he done it? Couldn't done it? How could've he done it? Couldn't be? Could it? Hello 911? How are you? I'm sorry it was just a reflex...I know it's an emergency number...it is an emergency...my friend is being accused of being a smog strangler and I know he didn't do it...they're putting me trough to the detective in charge of the investigation...what is my name? Who am I? I'm eh...George Costanza..."
S04E02,GEORGE,What's the matter with you? Are you crazy? Why are you using my name?!
S04E02,JERRY,"Oh, don't be a baby! What are you scared of?"
S04E02,GEORGE,"What am I scared of? I'm scared of the same thing that you are, everything! Why don't you just use your own name?"
S04E02,JERRY,"Your name is a good name, Costanza. Sounds like it's stands for something, they'll believe us."
S04E02,GEORGE,Really?
S04E02,JERRY,Sure.
S04E02,GEORGE,You think so?
S04E02,JERRY,"Oh yeah. Yes I have some very important information regarding the smog strangler. (George leans close) would you suck a mint or something. Can I come right now? I suppose, where are you located? Where is that? I don't know where we are. Where are we?"
S04E02,GEORGE,I don't know.
S04E02,JERRY,"We don't know. He says ask somebody, ask that guy."
S04E02,GEORGE,"Excuse me, where are we?"
S04E02,MAN,Earth.
S04E02,JERRY,"Hey, you know I'm on the phone with the police! Some guy just gave me a wise answer. Ask that woman."
S04E02,GEORGE,Excuse me Ms. which street are we on?
S04E02,WOMAN,I don't know.
S04E02,GEORGE,You don't know?
S04E02,WOMAN,I don't know.
S04E02,GEORGE,How come you don't know what street are you on?
S04E02,WOMAN,You don't know.
S04E02,JERRY,"George, it says it here on the phone. It's 12145 Ventura Boulevard. Aha, ok...do we know where the 101 is? (George shakes his head) No...do we know where 170 is? (George shakes his head) No...do we know where 134 is? (George just looks at Jerry) No. Aha, ok. (Jerry hangs up) He's gonna send a black and white to pick us up."
S04E02,GEORGE,Black and white?
S04E02,JERRY,A cop car.
S04E02,GEORGE,Why didn't you just say that?
S04E02,JERRY,I thought it sounded kind of cool.
S04E02,GEORGE,"Oh yeah, real cool. You're a cool guy."
S04E02,JERRY,"Oh, you are? I guaranty you, Lupe is going to tuck your covers in."
S04E02,GEORGE,"I'll bet you, how much?"
S04E02,JERRY,Her tip.
S04E02,GEORGE,You've got a bet.
S04E02,JERRY,Ok.
S04E02,GEORGE,How much do you tip a chamber maid?
S04E02,POLICE,Which one of you is Costanza?
S04E02,POLICE,Get in.
S04E02,GEORGE,"Hi, how are you guys? Listen, does either one of you have like a mint or piece of gum or..."
S04E02,GEORGE,"Jerry, would you do me a favor, close the window."
S04E02,JERRY,"Hey, get out of here...hey officer, he's fooling around back here."
S04E02,COP,Cut it up back there.
S04E02,GEORGE,He started it.
S04E02,JERRY,I did not. You guys gonna go through some red lights?
S04E02,COP,I don't think so.
S04E02,JERRY,But you could?
S04E02,COP,"Oh yeah, of course we could. We can do anything we want."
S04E02,COP 2,We could drive on the wrong side of the road.
S04E02,COP,"Yeah, we do that all the time. You should see the looks on people's faces."
S04E02,COP 2,Shoot people...
S04E02,GEORGE,You guys ever shot anybody?
S04E02,COPS,No...
S04E02,GEORGE,"Hey, can I flip on the siren?"
S04E02,JERRY,Why are you bothering them for?
S04E02,GEORGE,"I'm just asking, all they have to do is say no."
S04E02,COP,"Yeah, go ahead."
S04E02,GEORGE,"Wohoo, check it out."
S04E02,JERRY,Can I try it?
S04E02,COP,"Yeah, go ahead, hurry up."
S04E02,JERRY,Scared the hell out of that guy.
S04E02,GEORGE,"You know what I never understood? Why did they change the siren noise? When I was a kid it was always ""waaaa, waaaa"", you know now it ""woo-woo-woo-woo-woo"". Why did they do that, did they do some research? Did they find that woo-woo was more effective than waa?"
S04E02,JERRY,"Yeah, what about those English sirens, you know...eee-aaa-eee-aaa-eee-aaa..."
S04E02,JERRY and GEORGE,Eee-aaa-eee-aaa-eee-aaa...
S04E02,COP,Hey!
S04E02,KRAMER,I'm dizzy.
S04E02,JERRY,Nice shotgun.
S04E02,COP,Thanks.
S04E02,JERRY,Clean as a whistle.
S04E02,GEORGE,You could eat of that shotgun.
S04E02,JERRY,"What is that, a 12 gauge?"
S04E02,COP,Yeah.
S04E02,JERRY,12 gauge. Seems to be the most popular gauge.
S04E02,GEORGE,My favorite.
S04E02,JERRY,"Mine too, love the 12 gauge."
S04E02,GEORGE,Makes the 11 gauge look like a cap pistol.
S04E02,COP,What do got over there?
S04E02,COP 2,I don't know.
S04E02,COP,Looks like a possible 5-19.
S04E02,JERRY,5-19? What's a 5-19?
S04E02,GEORGE,Where?
S04E02,COP 2,Think so?
S04E02,COP,Looks like it.
S04E02,JERRY,I can't believe this. A 5-19?
S04E02,GEORGE,"Where, where? I can't see."
S04E02,COP,"This is car 23, we have a possible 5-19 in progress, over."
S04E02,COP 2,"All right, let's pull over and check it out."
S04E02,JERRY,Pull over? You can't pull over.
S04E02,GEORGE,What are you doing? Where do you think you're going?
S04E02,JERRY,Pull over? The lieutenant is waiting to see us.
S04E02,GEORGE,"Hey hey hey, we're in a rush here."
S04E02,JERRY,We have an appointment!
S04E02,GEORGE,What are you doing?!
S04E02,JERRY,Great.
S04E02,GEORGE,There's a bag of Pepperidge Farm cookies up there.
S04E02,JERRY,Which flavor?
S04E02,GEORGE,Milano.
S04E02,JERRY,Cops eating Milanos. What crazy town is this?
S04E02,GEORGE,Should I take some?
S04E02,JERRY,I think that's a 5-19.
S04E02,GEORGE,I'm starving...
S04E02,JERRY,They're busting this guy.
S04E02,GEORGE,They're cuffing him.
S04E02,JERRY,I can't believe this.
S04E02,GEORGE,Hi.
S04E02,JERRY,"Hi, I'm Jerry."
S04E02,GEORGE,"George, how you doing?"
S04E02,GUY,What did you do?
S04E02,GEORGE,Nothing.
S04E02,JERRY,Nothing.
S04E02,GUY,"Oh yeah right, me neither. Hey I didn't do nothing!"
S04E02,COP,Shut up.
S04E02,JERRY,Hot out.
S04E02,GUY,Brutal.
S04E02,GEORGE,What do you tip a chamber maid.
S04E02,GUY,"I don't know, five bucks a night."
S04E02,JERRY,"No, a dollar, two tops."
S04E02,GUY,"Hey, you guys aren't cuffed. What are you, narks?"
S04E02,GEORGE,Narks?
S04E02,JERRY,"Imagine, us narks?"
S04E02,GEORGE,"No no no, you know actually we are friends of a serial killer."
S04E02,GUY,"Really? Well, that's very nice."
S04E02,GEORGE,"Oh, thank you."
S04E02,JERRY,"Suspected serial killer, he didn't actually do it."
S04E02,GEORGE,"Yeah well, we don't think."
S04E02,JERRY,We're pretty sure.
S04E02,GUY,A dollar a night?
S04E02,JERRY,"Yeah, that's a good tip!"
S04E02,GUY,That stinks!
S04E02,JERRY,I read it in Ann Landers.
S04E02,GUY,"Oh, Ann Landers sucks!"
S04E02,COP 2,"Hey, shut it up back there."
S04E02,POLICE RADIO,"Attention all units, attention all units, all units code 3. All units in the area, code 3 in progress, 1648 North Bartholis, units required for assistance in apprehension of 702."
S04E02,COP,That's smog strangler.
S04E02,JERRY,Kramer.
S04E02,COP 2,Got him. Let's go.
S04E02,JERRY,I wanna see what's happening.
S04E02,GEORGE,I don't know why I'm doing this.
S04E02,KRAMER,"Jerry, George!"
S04E02,LT. MARTEL,You are under arrest in first degree murder and death of Ms Chelsea Lang.
S04E02,REPORTERS,Why did you do it? What possessed you?
S04E02,KRAMER,I don't know...
S04E02,KRAMER,"Hey, how are you doing? Jerry! George!"
S04E02,JERRY,We're doing fine. How are you?
S04E02,KRAMER,"What me? Fabulous, just fabulous. I've got a lot of auditions, a lot of call backs and I've got a lot of interest for my movie treatment. I'm in development, I'm in developed vehicles. And there's a lot of energy here, man. You know, the vibe, it's powerful. I'm just swept up at it. Yeah, I'm a player."
S04E02,GEORGE,A player?
S04E02,KRAMER,"Yeah, a player..."
S04E02,JERRY,"Kramer, do you realize what's going on here? Do you know why you're here?"
S04E02,KRAMER,"What? What this? I'll be out of here in couple of hours. Hey, guess who I met today? Rick Savage, oh nice kid, really good kid. You know, we're talking about doing a project together."
S04E02,JERRY,"Kramer, you've been arrested as a serial killer!"
S04E02,KRAMER,"So? I'm innocent! I mean you guys believe that I'm innocent, don't you? Jerry? George?"
S04E02,JERRY,"Well, yeah...sure."
S04E02,POLICE,"Kramer, let's go. The Lieutenant wants to see you."
S04E02,KRAMER,"Ok, yeah. All right look, I'll be out of here by noon. Maybe we'll have lunch together, huh?"
S04E02,KRAMER,Help me!! Help me!
S04E02,KRAMER,"I didn't kill anyone, I swear! I swear to God!"
S04E02,LT. MARTEL,"Don't you ever swear to my God, Kramer. My God is the god who protects the innocent and punishes the evil scum like you, have you got that?"
S04E02,KRAMER,You're making a big mistake.
S04E02,LT. MARTEL,"No! You have made the mistake, Kramer. Sickies like you always do. The only difference is that this time you're gonna pay."
S04E02,KRAMER,What?
S04E02,LT. MARTEL,"Now you might beat the gas chamber Kramer, but as long as I have got a breath in my body you will never ever see the light of day again."
S04E02,KRAMER,"Wow wow wow wow, you've got the wrong man!! It wasn't me!"
S04E02,LT. MARTEL,"Oh yeah, right. Maybe it was one of your other personalities huh, the wise guy, the little kid, the bellhop, the ball player, maybe the door to door vacuum cleaner salesman, but not you right? No, you wouldn't hurt a fly. You just couldn't help yourself, could you Kramer? You saw life brimming brightly with optimism and verve and you just had to snuff it out."
S04E02,KRAMER,"Ok, can I just talk to somebody? Can I just explain..."
S04E02,LT. MARTEL,"I'm not interested in your explanations, Kramer! Sure, I bet you've got a million of 'em. Maybe your mother didn't love you enough, maybe the teacher didn't call on you in school when you had your little hand raised, maybe the pervert in the park had a present in his pants, huh? Well, I've got another theory you're a weed."
S04E02,KRAMER,No...
S04E02,LT. MARTEL,Society is filled with them. They're choking the life out of the all pretty flowers.
S04E02,LT. MARTEL,"You see something even remotely pretty and you have to choke the life out if it, don't you Kramer?"
S04E02,LT. MARTEL,"You killed all the pretty flowers, didn't you Kramer? You killed the pretty little flowers, didn't you? You dirty, filthy, stinky weed! Didn't you?"
S04E02,OFFICER,"Lieutenant, it's for you."
S04E02,LT. MARTEL,Martel...yeah...yeah...yeah...yeah.
S04E02,OFFICER,"What it is, Lieutenant?"
S04E02,LT. MARTEL,Let him go.
S04E02,OFFICER,"What, but Lieutenant?"
S04E02,LT. MARTEL,"You heard me, let him go. They just found another body at the Laurel Canyon. Go on Kramer, get out of my sight."
S04E02,KRAMER,"Hey, how did you know about the guy in the park?"
S04E02,LT. MARTEL,I said beat it!
S04E02,KRAMER,Hahaa!
S04E02,GEORGE,What?
S04E02,JERRY,What happened?
S04E02,KRAMER,Somebody got killed while they had me in custody.
S04E02,JERRY,Really? Did you hear that? Somebody else was killed!
S04E02,GEORGE,You're kidding? Somebody else got killed?
S04E02,JERRY,While you were in jail. So you're free.
S04E02,KRAMER,"Yes, I'm free. (singing) 'cause the murderer struck again!"
S04E02,JERRY,"So Kramer, what are you going to do?"
S04E02,KRAMER,"Do? Do? Hey, I'm doing what I do. You know, I've always done what I do. I'm doing what I do, way I've always done and the way I'll always do it."
S04E02,GEORGE,"Kramer, what the hell are you talking about?"
S04E02,KRAMER,"What do you want me to say? That the things haven't worked out the way that I planned? That I'm struggling, barely able to keep my head above water? That L.A. is a cold place even in the middle of the summer? That it's a lonely place even when your stuck in traffic at the Hollywood Freeway? That I'm no better than a screenwriter driving a cab, a starlet turning tricks, a producer in a house he can't afford? Is that what you want me to say?"
S04E02,GEORGE,I'd like to hear that.
S04E02,JERRY,Yeah...
S04E02,KRAMER,"Well, I'm not saying that! You know, things are going pretty well for me here. I met a girl..."
S04E02,JERRY,"Kramer, she was murdered!"
S04E02,KRAMER,"Yeah, well I wasn't looking for a long term relationship. I was on TV."
S04E02,GEORGE,As a suspect in a serial killing.
S04E02,KRAMER,"Ok, yeah, you guys got to put a negative spin on everything."
S04E02,GEORGE,"What did they put on this tuna? Tastes like a dill, I think it's a dill."
S04E02,JERRY,So you're not gonna come back to New York with us?
S04E02,KRAMER,"No no I'm not ready, things are starting to happen."
S04E02,GEORGE,"Taste this, is this a dill?"
S04E02,JERRY,"No, it's tarragon. Hey Kramer, I'm sorry about that whole fight we had about you having my apartment keys and everything."
S04E02,KRAMER,"Ok, it's forgotten."
S04E02,GEORGE,"Tarragon? Oh, you're crazy."
S04E02,JERRY,"Well, take it easy."
S04E02,KRAMER,"Yeah, ok."
S04E02,GEORGE,"Yeah, take care. Stay in touch."
S04E02,KRAMER,"Hey hey, whoa come on give me a hug..."
S04E02,JERRY,"Oh, no..."
S04E02,GEORGE,"No, you're crushing my sandwich."
S04E02,JERRY,"Yeah, it's so nice when it happens to you."
S04E02,GEORGE,Mint?
S04E02,JERRY,No thanks.
S04E02,GEORGE,"I've got to tell you, I'm really disappointed in Lupe."
S04E02,JERRY,"It's been three days already, forget about Lupe."
S04E02,GEORGE,Do you think she gets to take any of those little bars of soap home?
S04E02,JERRY,"No, I don't."
S04E02,GEORGE,"You would think that at the end of the week when they hand out the checks, throw in a few soaps."
S04E02,JERRY,"Yeah, maybe they should throw in a couple of lamps too."
S04E02,GEORGE,"I'll tell you something, if I'd own a company, my employees would love me. They'd have huge pictures of me up on the walls and in their home, like Lenin."
S04E02,JERRY,How much did you wound up tipping her?
S04E02,GEORGE,"Oh my God, I forgot!"
S04E02,JERRY,"Well, communism didn't work."
S04E02,KRAMER,Hey!
S04E02,KRAMER,Any mustard? This is empty.
S04E02,JERRY,"Yeah, there's a new one in there."
S04E02,KRAMER,"No no, I don't like this one. It's too yellow. Any pickles?"
S04E02,JERRY,Help yourself.
S04E02,KRAMER,"Yeah, all right."
S04E02,GEORGE,"Kramer, what are you doing here?"
S04E02,KRAMER,Getting something to eat.
S04E02,JERRY,"Kramer, here!"
S04E02,Newscaster,"Authorities exposed today, that the latest suspect in the smog strangling was apprehended this week on an unrelated charge, but somehow managed to escape from the police car, in which he was being held. Tobias Lehigh Nagy, who is also wanted in connection with a series of unrelated slains in the North West is still at large, his whereabouts unknown. He's described as 5'5"" bald and reputedly a very generous tipper."
S04E03,GEORGE,What did they do for toilet paper in the civil war?
S04E03,JERRY,What?
S04E03,GEORGE,I wonder what toilet paper was loike in the 1860's. Did they carry it in rolls in their duffle bags?
S04E03,JERRY,Everything with you comes down to toilet paper.
S04E03,GEORGE,What?
S04E03,JERRY,That's always the first question with you. Why is that always your focus?
S04E03,GEORGE,"All right, so what did they do?"
S04E03,JERRY,I don't know. Maybe they gave out fig leaf clumps to all the soldiers.
S04E03,GEORGE,Well I think it would be nice if there was some kind of historical record of it.
S04E03,JERRY,"Maybe they should have a toilet paper museum. Would you like that? So we could see all the toilet paper advancements down through the ages. Toilet paper of the Crusades, the development of the perforation, the first six-pack . . ."
S04E03,STU,"Excuse me, Jerry? I'm Stu Chermak. I'm with NBC."
S04E03,JERRY,Hi.
S04E03,STU,Could we speak for a few moments?
S04E03,JERRY,Sure.
S04E03,JAY,"Hi, Jay Crespi."
S04E03,JERRY,Hello.
S04E03,GEORGE,"Uh, C-R-E-S-P-I?"
S04E03,JAY,That's right.
S04E03,GEORGE,I'm unbelievable at spelling last names. Give me a last name.
S04E03,JAY,"Mm, I'm not-"
S04E03,JERRY,George-
S04E03,GEORGE,"(backing off) Huh? All right, fine."
S04E03,STU,"First of all, that was a terrific show."
S04E03,JERRY,Oh thank you very much.
S04E03,STU,"And basically, I just wanted to let you know that we've been discussing you at some of our meetings and we'd be very interested in doing something."
S04E03,JERRY,Really? Wow.
S04E03,STU,"So, if you have any idea for like a TV show for yourself, well, we'd just love to talk about it."
S04E03,JERRY,I'd be very interested in something like that.
S04E03,STU,"Well, here, uh, why don't you give us a call and maybe we can develop a series."
S04E03,JERRY,Okay. Great. Thanks.
S04E03,STU,It was very nice meeting you.
S04E03,JERRY,Thank you.
S04E03,JAY,Nice meeting you.
S04E03,JERRY,Nice meeting you.
S04E03,GEORGE,What was that all about?
S04E03,JERRY,They said they were interested in me.
S04E03,GEORGE,For what?
S04E03,JERRY,"You know, a TV show."
S04E03,GEORGE,Your own show?
S04E03,JERRY,"Yeah, I guess so."
S04E03,GEORGE,They want you to do a TV show?
S04E03,JERRY,"Well, they want me to come up with an idea. I mean, I don't have any ideas."
S04E03,GEORGE,"Come on, how hard is that? Look at all the junk that's on TV. You want an idea? Here's an idea. You coach gymnastics team in high school. And you're married. And your son's not interested in gymnastics and you're pushing him into gymnastics."
S04E03,JERRY,Why should I care if my son's into gymnastics?
S04E03,GEORGE,Because you're a gymnastics teacher. It's only natural.
S04E03,JERRY,But gymnastics is not for everybody.
S04E03,GEORGE,"I know, but he's your son."
S04E03,JERRY,So what?
S04E03,GEORGE,"All right, forget that idea, it's not for you....Okay, okay, I got it. You run an antique store."
S04E03,JERRY,Yeah and...?
S04E03,GEORGE,And people come in the store and you get involved in their lives.
S04E03,JERRY,What person who runs an antique store gets involved in people's lives?
S04E03,GEORGE,Why not?
S04E03,JERRY,So someone comes in to buy an old lamp and all of a sudden I'm getting them out of a jam? I could see if I was a pharmacist because a pharmacist knows what's wrong with everybody that comes in.
S04E03,GEORGE,"I know, but antiques are very popular right now."
S04E03,JERRY,"No they're not, they used to be."
S04E03,GEORGE,"Oh yeah, like you know."
S04E03,JERRY,Oh like you do.
S04E03,KRAMER,...And you're the manager of the circus.
S04E03,JERRY,A circus?
S04E03,KRAMER,"Come on, this is a great idea. Look at the characters. You've got all these freaks on the show. A woman with a moustache? I mean, who wouldn't tune in to see a women with a moustache? You've for the tallest man in the world; a guy who's just a head."
S04E03,JERRY,I don't think so.
S04E03,KRAMER,"Look Jerry, the show isn't about the circus, it's about watching freaks."
S04E03,JERRY,I don't think the network will go for it.
S04E03,KRAMER,Why not?
S04E03,JERRY,"Look, I'm not pitching a show about freaks."
S04E03,KRAMER,"Oh come on Jerry, you're wrong. People they want to watch freaks. This is a ""can't miss."""
S04E03,NEWMAN,Kramer.
S04E03,JERRY,Hello Newman.
S04E03,NEWMAN,Come on lets go. I got the helmet. Lets get the radar detector.
S04E03,KRAMER,All right I'll be back in a second. You guys coming to my party? (exits)
S04E03,JERRY AND NEWMAN,"Yeah, sure."
S04E03,JERRY,What's this all about?
S04E03,NEWMAN,We're making a trade. I'm giving him my motorcycle helmet - he's giving me his radar detector.
S04E03,JERRY,I didn't know you had a motorctcle.
S04E03,NEWMAN,Well my girlfriend had one.
S04E03,JERRY,You have a girlfriend?
S04E03,NEWMAN,I HAD a girlfriend and she was pretty wild.
S04E03,JERRY,I never remember you with a girl.
S04E03,NEWMAN,"Nevertheless, ..."
S04E03,JERRY,This is a pretty bad deal for Kramer. You know a radar detector is worth much more than that helmet. I think you're cheating him.
S04E03,NEWMAN,Don't say anything.
S04E03,JERRY,All right.
S04E03,JERRY,You know you're getting gypped over here.
S04E03,KRAMER,"Really, Ah,"
S04E03,NEWMAN,We had a deal. Are you reneging out of the deal? Are you reneging? That's a renege.
S04E03,KRAMER,"Oh, stop saying 'reneging""."
S04E03,NEWMAN,Well you're reneging.
S04E03,KRAMER,"I, Okay, okay. I'm not reneging."
S04E03,NEWMAN,All right give it to me. let go ...
S04E03,KRAMER,You let go - come on ...(they fight over the items)
S04E03,JERRY,Gimme that - just gimme that. Here. Idiots!
S04E03,NEWMAN,Thanks buddy. So long he he ...(exits)
S04E03,JERRY,Does that thing work?
S04E03,KRAMER,Nah.
S04E03,JERRY,... I just got a postcard from Elaine?
S04E03,GEORGE,Really?
S04E03,JERRY,"Yeah, they're in London now. They'll be back in a few weeks."
S04E03,GEORGE,I can't believe she got involved with a shrink.
S04E03,GEORGE,"So, what's happening with the TV show? You come up with anything?"
S04E03,JERRY,"No, nothing."
S04E03,GEORGE,Why don't they have salsa on the table?
S04E03,JERRY,What do you need salsa for?
S04E03,GEORGE,Salsa is now the number one condiment in America.
S04E03,JERRY,"You know why? Because people like to say ""salsa."" ""Excuse me, do you have salsa?"" ""We need more salsa."" ""Where is the salsa? No salsa?"""
S04E03,GEORGE,"You know it must be impossible for a Spanish person to order seltzer and not get salsa. (Angry) ""I wanted seltzer, not salsa."""
S04E03,JERRY,"""Don't you know the difference between seltzer and salsa?? You have the seltezer after the salsa!"""
S04E03,GEORGE,"See, this should be a show. This is the show."
S04E03,JERRY,What?
S04E03,GEORGE,This. Just talking.
S04E03,JERRY,"(dismissing) Yeah, right."
S04E03,GEORGE,I'm really serious. I think that's a good idea.
S04E03,JERRY,Just talking? Well what's the show about?
S04E03,GEORGE,It's about nothing.
S04E03,JERRY,No story?
S04E03,GEORGE,No forget the story.
S04E03,JERRY,You've got to have a story.
S04E03,GEORGE,"Who says you gotta have a story? Remember when we were waiting for, for that table in that Chinese restaurant that time? That could be a TV show."
S04E03,JERRY,And who is on the show? Who are the characters?
S04E03,GEORGE,I could be a character.
S04E03,JERRY,You?
S04E03,GEORGE,Yeah. You could base a character on me.
S04E03,JERRY,"So, on the show, there's a character named George Costanza?"
S04E03,GEORGE,"Yeah. There's something wrong with that? I'm a character. People are always saying to me, ""You know you're a quite a character."""
S04E03,JERRY,And who else is on the show?
S04E03,GEORGE,Elaine could be a character. Kramer..
S04E03,JERRY,Now he's a character. (Pause) So everybody I know is a character on the show.
S04E03,GEORGE,Right.
S04E03,JERRY,And it's about nothing?
S04E03,GEORGE,Absolutely nothing.
S04E03,JERRY,"So you're saying, I go in to NBC, and tell them I got this idea for a show about nothing."
S04E03,GEORGE,We go into NBC.
S04E03,JERRY,"""We""? Since when are you a writer?"
S04E03,GEORGE,(Scoffs) Writer. We're talking about a sit-com.
S04E03,JERRY,You want to go with me to NBC?
S04E03,GEORGE,Yeah. I think we really go something here.
S04E03,JERRY,What do we got?
S04E03,GEORGE,An idea.
S04E03,JERRY,What idea?
S04E03,GEORGE,An idea for the show.
S04E03,JERRY,I still don't know what the idea is.
S04E03,GEORGE,It's about nothing.
S04E03,JERRY,Right.
S04E03,GEORGE,"Everybody's doing something, we'll do nothing."
S04E03,JERRY,"So, we go into NBC, we tell them we've got an idea for a show about nothing."
S04E03,GEORGE,Exactly.
S04E03,JERRY,"They say, ""What's your show about?"" I say, ""Nothing."""
S04E03,GEORGE,There you go.
S04E03,JERRY,(Nodding) I think you may have something there.
S04E03,JERRY,"So, the show would be about my real life. And one of the characters would be based on you."
S04E03,KRAMER,"(Thinks) No, I don't think so."
S04E03,JERRY,What do you mean you don't think so?
S04E03,KRAMER,I don't like it.
S04E03,JERRY,I don't understand. What don't you like about it?
S04E03,KRAMER,I don't like the idea of a character based on me.
S04E03,JERRY,Why not?
S04E03,KRAMER,well it just doesn't sit well.
S04E03,JERRY,You're my neighbor. There's got to be a character based on you.
S04E03,KRAMER,"That's your problem, buddy."
S04E03,JERRY,I don't understand what the big deal is.
S04E03,KRAMER,"Hey, I'll tell you what - you can do it on one condition."
S04E03,JERRY,Whatever you want.
S04E03,KRAMER,I get to play Kramer.
S04E03,JERRY,You can't play Kramer.
S04E03,KRAMER,I am Kramer.
S04E03,JERRY,But you can't act.
S04E03,KRAMER,Phew!
S04E03,JERRY,"Okay, fine. We'll use Newman."
S04E03,KRAMER,Newman?
S04E03,NEWMAN,Use me for what?
S04E03,JERRY,Nothin' What do you want?
S04E03,NEWMAN,"Well, you'll never guess what happened to me today. I was uh, driving ( Jerry and Kramer turn away) home on the palisades parkway when I looked in the rear view mirror and what did I see? The fuzz. And it's funny because my new radar detector was on. I didn't hear a thing. Isn't that strange?"
S04E03,KRAMER,Yeah. That's strange.
S04E03,NEWMAN,"A radar detector, as I understand it, DETECTS RADAR! WITH A SERIES OF BEEPS AND FLASHING LIGHTS. But oddly, for some reason I didn't hear a thing except for the sound of a police siren."
S04E03,KRAMER,That's queer uh?
S04E03,NEWMAN,I WANT MY HELMET BACK! GIVE ME BACK MY HELMET AND YOU'RE GOING TO PAY FOR THAT TICKET.
S04E03,KRAMER,"Yeah, you better think again Mojumbo."
S04E03,NEWMAN,You gave me a defective detector. ... Jerry?
S04E03,JERRY,Buyer beware.
S04E03,NEWMAN,Are you going to give me back that helmet or not?
S04E03,KRAMER,No. We had a deal. There are no guarantees in life.
S04E03,NEWMAN,"No, but there's karma, Kramer."
S04E03,JERRY,Karma Kramer?
S04E03,NEWMAN,And one more thing. I'm not coming to your party. (exits)
S04E03,JERRY,"(To himself) Salsa, seltzer. Hey, excuse me, you got any salsa? No, not selzer, salsa. (George doesn't react) What's the matter?"
S04E03,GEORGE,(Nervous) Nothing.
S04E03,JERRY,You sure? You look a little pale.
S04E03,GEORGE,"No, I'm fine. I'm good. I'm very good."
S04E03,JERRY,"What, are you nervous?"
S04E03,GEORGE,"No, not nervous. I'm good, very good. (A beat, then he snaps) I can't do this! Can't do this!"
S04E03,JERRY,What?
S04E03,GEORGE,I can't do this! I can't do it. I have tried. I'm here. It's impossible.
S04E03,JERRY,This was your idea!
S04E03,GEORGE,What idea? I just said something. I didn't know you were going to listen to me.
S04E03,JERRY,Dont' worry about it. They're just TV executives.
S04E03,GEORGE,"They're men with jobs, Jerry! They wear suits and ties. They're married, they have secretaries."
S04E03,JERRY,I told you not to come.
S04E03,GEORGE,I need some water. I gotta get some water.
S04E03,JERRY,They'll give us water in there.
S04E03,GEORGE,Really? That's pretty good.
S04E03,JERRY,"Oh God, it's Joe Devola."
S04E03,GEORGE,Who?
S04E03,JERRY,"This guy's a writer, he's a total nut. I think he goes to the same shrink as Elaine."
S04E03,JERRY,Oh God he saw me.
S04E03,DEVOLA,Hello Jerry.
S04E03,JERRY,Hey Joe! HOW YOU DOING?
S04E03,DEVOLA,You're under no obligation to shake my hand.
S04E03,JERRY,"Oh, no, Just a custom. Uh, THAT'S MY FRIEND GEORGE. YOU LOOK GOOD."
S04E03,DEVOLA,Why shouldn't I look good?
S04E03,JERRY,"Oh, no reason. You're into karate right?"
S04E03,DEVOLA,You want to hit me?
S04E03,JERRY,What are you doing here?
S04E03,DEVOLA,I dreopped a script off.
S04E03,JERRY,"AH, GOOD FOR YOU."
S04E03,JERRY,"Well, ..."
S04E03,DEVOLA,You don't have to say anything.
S04E03,JERRY,"No, Uh, hey I guess I'll see you Sunday night."
S04E03,DEVOLA,Why?
S04E03,JERRY,Kramer's party.
S04E03,DEVOLA,Kramer's ... having ... a ... party?
S04E03,JERRY,"No, no, he's not having a party. He's doing something. I don't know what it is. It's nothing. He's not doing anything."
S04E03,DEVOLA,"Gee, I thought Kramer and I were very close friends."
S04E03,JERRY,"No, I'm sure you are. I'm sure you are very close friends. Very close."
S04E03,JERRY,Give my best to Hinckley.
S04E03,GEORGE,What was that?
S04E03,JERRY,"I can't believe what I just did. I didn't know kramer didn't invite him. I better call Kramer, ..."
S04E03,RECEPTIONIST,They're ready for you.
S04E03,GEORGE,"Okay, okay. Look, you do all the talking, okay?"
S04E03,JERRY,Relax. Who are they?
S04E03,GEORGE,"Yeah, they're not better than me."
S04E03,JERRY,Course not.
S04E03,GEORGE,Who are they?
S04E03,JERRY,They're nobody.
S04E03,GEORGE,What about me?
S04E03,JERRY,What about you?
S04E03,GEORGE,Why them? Why not me?
S04E03,JERRY,Why not you?
S04E03,GEORGE,I'm as good as them.
S04E03,JERRY,Better.
S04E03,GEORGE,You really think so?
S04E03,JERRY,No.
S04E03,STU,"(To Jerry, laughing about one of his bits) The bit, the bit I really liked what were the parakeet flew into the mirror. Now that's funny."
S04E03,GEORGE,"The parakeet in the mirror. That's a good one, Stu."
S04E03,JERRY,"Yeah, it's one of my favorites."
S04E03,RUSSELL,"What about you, George? Have you written anything we might know?"
S04E03,GEORGE,"(Quickly making it up) Well, possibly. I wrote an off-Broadway show, ""La Cocina."" ..Actually, it was off-off-Broadway. It was a comedy about a Mexican chef."
S04E03,JERRY,"Oh, it was very funny. There was one great scene with the chef - what was his name?"
S04E03,GEORGE,Pepe.
S04E03,JERRY,"Oh, Pepe. Yeah, Pepe. And, uh, he was making tamales."
S04E03,SUSAN,"Oh, he actually cooked on the stage?"
S04E03,GEORGE,"No, no, he mimed it. That's what was so funny about it."
S04E03,RUSSELL,"So, what have you two come up with?"
S04E03,JERRY,"Well, we've thought about this in a variety of ways. But the basic idea is I will play myself-"
S04E03,GEORGE,(Interrupting) May I?
S04E03,JERRY,Go ahead.
S04E03,GEORGE,I think I can sum up the show for you with one word NOTHING.
S04E03,RUSSELL,Nothing?
S04E03,GEORGE,(Smiling) Nothing.
S04E03,RUSSELL,(Unimpressed) What does that mean?
S04E03,GEORGE,The show is about nothing.
S04E03,JERRY,"(To George) Well, it's not about nothing."
S04E03,GEORGE,"(To Jerry) No, it's about nothing."
S04E03,JERRY,"Well, maybe in philosophy. But, even nothing is something."
S04E03,RECEPTIONIST,"Mr. Dalrymple, your niece is on the phone."
S04E03,RUSSELL,I'll call back.
S04E03,GEORGE,(Attempting to spell his last name) D-A-L-R-I-M-P-E-L?
S04E03,RUSSELL,(Obviously dislikes George) Not even close.
S04E03,GEORGE,"Is it with a ""y""?"
S04E03,RUSSELL,No.
S04E03,SUSAN,What's the premise?
S04E03,JERRY,"..Well, as I was saying, I would play myself, and, as a comedian, living in New York, I have a friend, a neighbor, and an ex-girlfriend, which is all true."
S04E03,GEORGE,"Yeah, but nothing happens on the show. You see, it's just like life. You know, you eat, you go shopping, you read.. You eat, you read, You go shopping."
S04E03,RUSSELL,You read? You read on the show?
S04E03,JERRY,"Well, I don't know about the reading.. We didn't discuss the reading."
S04E03,RUSSELL,"All right, tell me, tell me about the stories. What kind of stories?"
S04E03,GEORGE,"Oh, no. No stories."
S04E03,RUSSELL,"No stories? So, what is it?"
S04E03,GEORGE,(Showing an example) What'd you do today?
S04E03,RUSSELL,I got up and came to work.
S04E03,GEORGE,There's a show. That's a show.
S04E03,RUSSELL,(Confused) How is that a show?
S04E03,JERRY,"Well, uh, maybe something happens on the way to work."
S04E03,GEORGE,"No, no, no. Nothing happens."
S04E03,JERRY,"Well, something happens."
S04E03,RUSSELL,"Well, why am I watching it?"
S04E03,GEORGE,Because it's on TV.
S04E03,RUSSELL,(Threatening) Not yet.
S04E03,GEORGE,"Okay, uh, look, if you want to just keep on doing the same old thing, then maybe this idea is not for you. I, for one, am not going to compromise my artistic integrity. And I'll tell you something else, this is the show and we're not going to change it. (To Jerry) Right?"
S04E03,JERRY,(To Russell) How about this I manage a circus..
S04E03,JERRY,"I don't even want to talk about it anymore. What were you thinking? What was going on in your mind? Artistic integrity? Where, where did you come up with that? You're not artistic and you have no integrity. You know you really need some help. A regular psychiatrist couldn't even help you. You need to go to like Vienna or something. You know what I mean? You need to get involved at the University level. Like where Freud studied and have all those people looking at you and checking up on you. That's the kind of help you need. Not the once a week for eighty bucks. No. You need a team. A team of psychiatrists working round the clock thinking about you, having conferences, observing you, like the way they did with the Elephant Man. That's what I'm talking about because that's the only way you're going to get better."
S04E03,GEORGE,. . . I thought the woman was kind of cute.
S04E03,JERRY,Hold it. I really want to be clear about this. Are you talking about the woman in the meeting? Is that the woman you're talking about?
S04E03,GEORGE,"Yeah, I thought I might give her a call. I, I don't meet that many women. I meet like three women a year. I mean, we've been introduced. She knows my name."
S04E03,JERRY,IT'S COMPLETELY INAPPROPRIATE!
S04E03,GEORGE,"Why? Maybe she liked me. I, I mean she was looking right at me. You know, I think she was impressed. You know, we had good eye contact the whole meeting."
S04E03,JERRY,"Oh, I forgot to call Kramer."
S04E03,GEORGE,Wait a minute let me call Susan.
S04E03,JERRY,"No, no this is more important."
S04E03,GEORGE,She might be leaving to work any minute.
S04E03,JERRY,"No, I got to warn him that I told Joe Devola about his party."
S04E03,GEORGE,No.
S04E03,ELAINE,What is it?
S04E03,DR. RESTON,I was just thinking about this patient of mine.
S04E03,ELAINE,What?
S04E03,DR. RESTON,Just wondering if he's taking his medication.
S04E03,ELAINE,"Well, come on we're on vacation."
S04E03,JERRY,"Well we were standing uh, inn the waiting area there, and you know how Devola is. He's all, ... (buzzer)"
S04E03,KRAMER,Yeah (to buzzer)
S04E03,GEORGE,(OC) It's George.
S04E03,JERRY,"And so, uh I felt very uncomfortable with him and you know I just blurted out something about your party."
S04E03,KRAMER,"Whoa, back up a second."
S04E03,JERRY,"Well, I didn't know that you didn't invite him."
S04E03,KRAMER,Why would you think I would invite him?
S04E03,JERRY,"I just a ssumed, ..."
S04E03,KRAMER,Assumed? Never assume anything. I don't want that nut in my house. You know he's on medication.
S04E03,GEORGE,"Hello, oh, hello. You remember, ... Susan, from N B C."
S04E03,JERRY,Of course. How are you?
S04E03,SUSAN,"Fine, it's good to see you."
S04E03,GEORGE,And this is Kramer.
S04E03,SUSAN,Hello.
S04E03,GEORGE,"All right go ahead Susan, tell him."
S04E03,JERRY,Tell me what?
S04E03,SUSAN,"Well, I, (phone rings)"
S04E03,JERRY,"Uh, sorry, Excuse me one second. Hello."
S04E03,TEL,"Hi, would you be interested in switching over to TMI long distance service."
S04E03,JERRY,"Oh, gee, I can't talk right now. Why don't you give me your home number and I'll call you later."
S04E03,TEL,"Uh, I'm sorry we're not allowed to do that."
S04E03,JERRY,"Oh, I guess you don't want people calling you at home."
S04E03,TEL,No.
S04E03,JERRY,Well now you know how I feel. (Hangs up)
S04E03,GEORGE,"Well, go ahead, tell him."
S04E03,JERRY,"Kramer, are you drinking that milk?"
S04E03,KRAMER,Yeah.
S04E03,JERRY,What's the expiration date on that?
S04E03,KRAMER,September third.
S04E03,JERRY,The third?
S04E03,GEORGE,and SUSAN The third?
S04E03,KRAMER,"Um, Uh, ugh, ..."
S04E03,SUSAN,Noooo... (Kramer throws up on Susan)
S04E03,GEORGE,I never should have brought her up there. Should have known better. Should have seen it coming. I didn't see it coming.
S04E03,JERRY,I think SHE saw it coming.
S04E03,GEORGE,You know she was behind the idea. She was going to champion the show. That's what I was bring her up there to tell you. And she liked me.
S04E03,JERRY,Look just because Kramer vomited on her doesn't mean the deal is dead.
S04E03,GEORGE,"What, are you crazy? It's a traumatic thing to be thrown up on."
S04E03,JERRY,"Vommiting is not a deal breaker. If Hitler had vommited on Chamberlin, Chamberlind still would have given him Chekoslovakia."
S04E03,GEORGE,"Chamberlind, you could hold his head in nthe toilet, he'd still give you half of Europe."
S04E03,JERRY,What happened to you?
S04E03,KRAMER,Devola came after me.
S04E03,JERRY,What? Devola? See I told you this guy is crazy. I can't believe this. What happened?
S04E03,KRAMER,"Can I have a coffee. ... What, you know I was walking home and I had to pick up my helmet from the shop, you know. I gota new strap. And I had it on you know, and I was checking the strap out to make sure it fit. Then suddenly I feel this kick hit me on the side of the head. It knocks me down, I look up and it's Crazy Joe Devola. And he say's, ""That's what I thin k of your party."""
S04E03,JERRY,"Boy, that is some kick."
S04E03,KRAMER,"Well, yeah, Newman's helmet, it saved my life. Look at that."
S04E03,JERRY,"Wow, Newman's helmet."
S04E03,GEORGE,Holly.
S04E03,KRAMER,I got bad news for you buddy. Devola says you're next.
S04E03,JERRY,"Me, why?"
S04E03,KRAMER,He doesn't like you.
S04E03,JERRY,What does he want from me? I didn't do anything. See this is all Elaine's fault. She took off to Europe with his psychiatrist. He probably can't get his medication. Now I got some nut after me.
S04E03,KRAMER,Pass the cream.
S04E03,GEORGE,Wait a second. (smells it). all right.
S04E04,JERRY,(going through couch cushions) Where the hell did I put this?
S04E04,KRAMER,What are you looking for?
S04E04,JERRY,"The remote, the remote, I can't find the remote. Did I lost, I lost it. Did you take it? Did you put it some place?"
S04E04,KRAMER,"No, no, no."
S04E04,JERRY,"All right, what is this?"
S04E04,KRAMER,(clueless) what is what?
S04E04,JERRY,"All right, very funny. I get it."
S04E04,KRAMER,You're in a weird mood.
S04E04,JERRY,Come on. Go back to your apartment and fix it.
S04E04,KRAMER,Fix what?
S04E04,JERRY,Your pants!
S04E04,KRAMER,what is this? What have I got one pant leg on for?
S04E04,JERRY,Don't you know? Look-look at your face! You only shaved the right side of your face! What is this? A joke?
S04E04,KRAMER,"No, t's a joke.. a joke... a joke... you think this is funny?"
S04E04,JERRY,Go look at your face in the mirror.
S04E04,KRAMER,Wha-huh-wha-huh...
S04E04,JERRY,(pressing intercom) yeah?
S04E04,GEORGE,(on intercom) It's George.
S04E04,JERRY,Come on up.
S04E04,KRAMER,I don't believe this.
S04E04,JERRY,"You mean, you didn't know you were doing any of these things?"
S04E04,KRAMER,"No, I swear."
S04E04,JERRY,I bet this is from that kick from that crazy Joe Davola. You better see a doctor and get some X-rays.
S04E04,GEORGE,(to Kramer) Ah! You're just the man I'm looking for.
S04E04,KRAMER,Me?
S04E04,GEORGE,"Yeah, here you go."
S04E04,KRAMER,What's this?
S04E04,GEORGE,A dry-cleaning bill?
S04E04,JERRY,From that woman at NBC?
S04E04,GEORGE,Yeah.
S04E04,KRAMER,A dry-cleaning bill for what?
S04E04,GEORGE,For vomiting on her vest!
S04E04,KRAMER,"Oh, come on George! I didn't do that on purpose!"
S04E04,GEORGE,"Well, I shouldn't have to pay for it!"
S04E04,KRAMER,"Well, neither should I! Jerry's the one who left the milk in the refrigerator."
S04E04,GEORGE,"(to Jerry) Yeah, your milk."
S04E04,JERRY,(pointing Kramer) He drank it.
S04E04,KRAMER,I didn't know.
S04E04,JERRY,"All right, well, we should all chip in I guess."
S04E04,KRAMER,Yeah.
S04E04,JERRY,How much was it to clean the vest?
S04E04,GEORGE,Eighteen dollars.
S04E04,JERRY,Can you get vomit out of suede?
S04E04,GEORGE,I don't know.
S04E04,KRAMER,Yo-yo Ma!
S04E04,JERRY,What? Yo-yo Ma?
S04E04,KRAMER,What about him?
S04E04,JERRY,You just said 'Yo-yo Ma'.
S04E04,GEORGE,What's Yo-yo Ma?
S04E04,JERRY,He's a cellist. (to Kramer) You should see a doctor today.
S04E04,GEORGE,"All right, come on, come on, let's go. Six dollars."
S04E04,JERRY,I can't believe she sent you that dry-cleaning bill.
S04E04,GEORGE,I know!
S04E04,JERRY,"That doesn't really bode well for the show, does it?"
S04E04,GEORGE,The show! Forget about the show! We should take the idea to a different network
S04E04,JERRY,"Oh, yeah. Right. Like anybody's ever gonna do this! How did you get me to go along with that? A show about nothing!"
S04E04,GEORGE,"It was a good idea. Susan liked it. Now, if he hadn't vomitted all over her, we'd be writing it right now."
S04E04,KRAMER,Jeez!
S04E04,GEORGE,Anyway.
S04E04,JERRY,"(interrupts) What are you doing? What's wrong with you? What're you doing? Give me that phone! Go to your apartment and lie down, I'll make an appointment for a doctor today. (on the phone) Hello? Oh hi! I'm sorry. No, that's my next door neighbor. He's not quite himself. He got kicked in the head. What? Really? You're kidding! Today? Yeah! Sure! We could make it. Two o'clock? Yeah, we would do that. Okay. Great! Thanks a million! Okay, bye."
S04E04,GEORGE,What?
S04E04,JERRY,NBC! They wanna have another meeting about the idea.
S04E04,GEORGE,"They wanna have another meeting? They wanna buy it?! They wanna but it?! Oh! I tell you! We're gonna be rich!! What are we gonna get for this? Fifty, sixty thousand?"
S04E04,JERRY,I don't know about sixty.
S04E04,GEORGE,"Oh, it's gotta be fifty! Hee hee! You know how much Ted Danson makes, huh?"
S04E04,JERRY,"Ted Danson! Now, how are you comparing us to Ted Danson?"
S04E04,GEORGE,I didn't say 'We're Ted Danson.'
S04E04,JERRY,"Yes, you did. You said 'We're Ted Danson'!"
S04E04,GEORGE,Oh!
S04E04,JERRY,"You know, I think he wears a piece."
S04E04,GEORGE,"Yeah, don't worry. He can afford it."
S04E04,JERRY,I'm ten minutes slow again! That's it for this piece of junk! I've had it.
S04E04,GEORGE,"What, is that the one your parents gave you?"
S04E04,JERRY,Yeah! But it never works. You know we're supposed to be there by two o'clock. We should take a cab.
S04E04,GEORGE,"All right, we'll be a little late, I,m not taking a cab."
S04E04,JERRY,I'll pay for it.
S04E04,GEORGE,It's not the money!
S04E04,JERRY,"Well, what is it you object to? The comfort? The Speed? The convenience?"
S04E04,LEO,Jerry!
S04E04,JERRY,Uncle Leo!
S04E04,LEO,Helloooo!
S04E04,JERRY,"Hello there, how're you doing?"
S04E04,LEO,Ha ha! How are you?
S04E04,JERRY,"Good, good."
S04E04,LEO,How's your mom and dad?
S04E04,JERRY,"Good, fine."
S04E04,LEO,What are you getting to be too much of a big shot now to give me a call? I don't hear from you anymore!
S04E04,JERRY,"Oh, no. I've been kinda busy. It's all."
S04E04,LEO,You know where I just came from?
S04E04,JERRY,"(not enthousiastic at all) Oh, sure. Danny."
S04E04,LEO,He used to be in the pajama business. I used to be able to get pajamas for free. I used to come over and get pajamas all the time!
S04E04,JERRY,"Oh, yeah, yeah. I remember."
S04E04,LEO,"The funny thing is I can't wear 'em. I get too hot. I sleep in my underwear and a t-shirt. If it gets too hot, I just get the t-shirt off! Anyway, Danny says to me 'You need any pajamas?'"
S04E04,JERRY,"(interrupts) I-I'm sorry Uncle Leo, I really gotta get going."
S04E04,LEO,"Oh. Well. You gotta get going, so go."
S04E04,JERRY,"We, we got a big meeting with the president of NBC."
S04E04,LEO,Nobody got a gun to your head!
S04E04,JERRY,"(seems sincere) Yeah, I'm really sorry, uh."
S04E04,LEO,"Go. Really. I understand. You got an appointment, go to your appointment."
S04E04,JERRY,"I'm sorry, really."
S04E04,LEO,"You know, I know plenty of people in Hollywood too!"
S04E04,JERRY,"Sorry, really."
S04E04,KRAMER,(from inside) Yeah?
S04E04,NEWMAN,"Come on, are you ready? Let's go!"
S04E04,KRAMER,For what?
S04E04,NEWMAN,What's the matter with you? I just talked to you fifteen minutes ago.
S04E04,KRAMER,what about?
S04E04,NEWMAN,The courthouse. You gotta go with me to the courthouse. I'm contesting a ticket today.
S04E04,KRAMER,"I can't, I'm going to the doctor's later."
S04E04,NEWMAN,"You gotta go with me. I mean, you-you're my alibi. You have to take the stand."
S04E04,KRAMER,"Well, I can't!"
S04E04,NEWMAN,"Well, let me remind you of something. You wouldn't be here if it wasn't for me and my helmet. I saved your life! You would be dead! Dead! You would cease to exist! You would be gone for the rest of eternity! You wouldn't even begin to comprehend what that means!!"
S04E04,KRAMER,Shut up! I'll get my coat!
S04E04,KRAMER,Don't step on anything.
S04E04,JERRY,You see the look on my uncle's face? Did you see how insulted he was? What could I do? Waht are we supposed to do? You can't leave. There's no excuse good enough to justify walking away from a conversation with one of my relatives.
S04E04,GEORGE,I didn't shave this morning. I don't feel like myself.
S04E04,JERRY,"You could be a fireman on a fire truck on the way to a fire. You bump into one of my relatives. 'I'm sorry Uncle Leo, there's a building full of people burning down. I really do have to be running.' He'll go 'Go. Go ahead. Go to your fancy fire. If that's what you have to do.'"
S04E04,GEORGE,Look at this.
S04E04,JERRY,Why didn't you shave this morning?
S04E04,GEORGE,'Cause I shaved yesterday in the afternoon.
S04E04,JERRY,Why?
S04E04,GEORGE,Because of the day before. It's a long story.
S04E04,JERRY,Is that Joe Davola?
S04E04,GEORGE,It's not him!
S04E04,JERRY,I can't live tlike this. I'm being stalked.
S04E04,Receptionist,Mister Seinfeld? They're ready for you.
S04E04,JERRY,Oh.
S04E04,GEORGE,Mister Seinfeld? What about Mister Costanza? I'm not here?
S04E04,JERRY,"All right. Look. Now, you promised you're gonna be a little more flexible on the nothing idea, okay? Jsut a little."
S04E04,GEORGE,Okay. A little.
S04E04,NEWMAN,"Okay, you're all set? You got your story?"
S04E04,KRAMER,No.
S04E04,NEWMAN,"When the cop stopped me, I told him that I was rushing home because my friend was about to commit suicide."
S04E04,KRAMER,Uhm...
S04E04,NEWMAN,"Now, you're that firend. Now, all we need is a reason why you were going to commit suicide."
S04E04,KRAMER,I never had an air conditioner.
S04E04,NEWMAN,No! That's no reason to kill yourself!
S04E04,KRAMER,"Why? It gets hot at night, you can't sleep. You ever tried to sleep in a really hot room?"
S04E04,NEWMAN,"Every night I sleep in a really hot room, I don't want to kill myself."
S04E04,KRAMER,"Well, I slept in really hot rooms and I wanted to kill myself."
S04E04,NEWMAN,"No, no, no. That's not gonna work. Something else."
S04E04,KRAMER,I was never able to become a banker.
S04E04,NEWMAN,Banker! So you're killing yourself because your dreams of becoming a banker have gone unfulfilled. You-you-you-you can't live without being a banker.
S04E04,KRAMER,"Yeah, yeah. If I can't be banker, I don't wanna live."
S04E04,NEWMAN,You must be banker.
S04E04,KRAMER,MUST be banker.
S04E04,NEWMAN (satisfied),"Okay, we'll go with the banker story."
S04E04,GEORGE,The story is the foundation of all entertainment. You must have a good story otherwise it's just masturbation.
S04E04,RUSSEL,And people really have to care about the characters.
S04E04,GEORGE,"Care? Forget about care. Love. They have to love the characters. Otherwise, why would they keep tuning in?"
S04E04,JERRY,Wouldn't tune in.
S04E04,GEORGE,Would they tune in?
S04E04,JERRY,No tune.
S04E04,RUSSEL,We like to look at the show as if it were in EKG. You have your highs and your lows and it goes up and down.
S04E04,GEORGE,The show will be like a heart attack!
S04E04,JERRY,Just a huge massive coronary.
S04E04,RUSSEL,"So what you said last week about no story, you're a little flexible on that now."
S04E04,GEORGE,Is-is that what I said 'no story'? Because Jerry had to tell me later.
S04E04,JERRY,He couldn't believe it.
S04E04,GEORGE,"(Laughs, snorts) I said, I said 'Get outta here! No story? Is that what I said?'"
S04E04,Police officer,"Well, I informed him that he was exceeding the speed limit and uh, that's when he told me that he was racing home because his friend was about to commit suicide."
S04E04,JUDGE,And then what happened?
S04E04,Police officer,"Well, then he became very loud and hysterical. He was flailing his arms about as he told the story and then he threw himself on the ground and he grabbed me around the legs and then he begged me to let him go. And when I refused, that's when he began to scream 'My friend's going to die, my friend's going to die.'"
S04E04,RUSSEL,Look. I don't know how you two guys feel but we would really like to be in business with you.
S04E04,GEORGE,"Well, we would like to be in business. Let's do business. We'll have some business. Let's have business."
S04E04,JERRY,We would love to be in business. We'll do business. We're in business. It's... it's business. This is business.
S04E04,GEORGE,Yeah!
S04E04,Stu,Would it be possible to get a-a-a copy of 'La Cocina'?
S04E04,JERRY,Your off-Broadway play.
S04E04,GEORGE,"Oh, oh. Uh, you know. It's the damndest thing. I, uh, I moved recently and my files, pfff, disappeared. Now, I-I don't know if they fell off the truck or if there was some sort of foul play but let me tell you something. I'm not through with that moving company."
S04E04,JERRY,"(backs his story) Hmm, hmm."
S04E04,GEORGE,That's my vow to you.
S04E04,RUSSEL,"Well, I got a feeling about you two. And even more than that. I place a great deal of confidence in that lady's judgment."
S04E04,GEORGE,Oh! That's good judgment. That's a pile of judgment there. Sure.
S04E04,JERRY,"Oh! Taht's judgment. Yes, yes. Judgment with earrings on. Yeah."
S04E04,RUSSEL,"(gets up) So, let's make a pilot."
S04E04,NEWMAN,I had gone up to Westchester. I go there every Tuesday. I do charity for the blind in my spare time for the Lighthouse. I was in the middle of a game of Parcheesi with an old blind man and I excused myself to call my friend as he was very depressed lately because he never became a banker.
S04E04,JUDGE,I don't understand.
S04E04,NEWMAN,"You see, it'd been his lifelong dream to be a banker and he uh, just the day before he was turned down by another bank. I believe it was the Manufacturer's Hanover on Lexington and 40th Street. That was the third bank to turn him down so I was-I was a little concerned. I wanted to see how he was doing. Well, Your Honor, he was barely audible. But I distinctly recall him say..."
S04E04,KRAMER,(interupts involuntarily) Yo-yo Ma!
S04E04,NEWMAN,"So I sped home to save my friend's life and I was stopped for speeding. Yes, I admit I was speeding but it was to save a man's life. A close friend. An innocent person who wanted nothing more out of life than to love, to be loved and to be a banker."
S04E04,JUDGE,So then he didn't kill himself.
S04E04,NEWMAN,No sir. He did not. But only by thge grace of God. He's in the courtroom today
S04E04,GEORGE,See?
S04E04,JERRY,Yeah!
S04E04,GEORGE,"I told you, I told you! Ha ha ha! Ooh ooh!"
S04E04,JERRY,"Now, all we gotta do is write it."
S04E04,GEORGE,Yes! How're we gonna do that?
S04E04,SUSAN,Hey! Congratulations!
S04E04,JERRY,Thanks.
S04E04,GEORGE,"Oh, thank you."
S04E04,JERRY,"Thank you, thanks."
S04E04,GEORGE,"Thanks. Gee, you know, I thought you were mad at me."
S04E04,SUSAN,No.
S04E04,Receptionist,"Mister Seinfeld, you have a phone call."
S04E04,JERRY,Phone call? Who knows I'm here?
S04E04,GEORGE,When you sent me the-the bill for the dry-cleaning. I thought the show didn't have a chance.
S04E04,SUSAN,"Oh, it was only vomit."
S04E04,GEORGE,"Anyway, I-I would like to-to pay for the cleaning."
S04E04,SUSAN,"Oh no-no, it's okay. *comment from transcriber yeah, she doesn't want to be paid, didn't she send the bill?*"
S04E04,GEORGE,"No-no-no, we all chipped in. We have the money."
S04E04,SUSAN,"Well, it was eighteen dollars."
S04E04,GEORGE,"Okay, uh, eighteen dollars, and there it is. There you go. So maybe we could get together this weekend."
S04E04,SUSAN,Yeah. Call me.
S04E04,GEORGE,"All right, great."
S04E04,SUSAN,Bye.
S04E04,JERRY,Bye thanks.
S04E04,GEORGE,"(chuckles) Bye, thanks. (To Jerry, when Susan is far) I can't believe she took the money."
S04E04,JERRY,Why?
S04E04,GEORGE,I offered to pay. She should've said no.
S04E04,JERRY,"She did, you insisted."
S04E04,GEORGE,"Maybe this is what the pilot should be about, vomiting on somebody's vest."
S04E04,JERRY,Nah!
S04E04,GEORGE,"How much are we gonna get for this? Fifty, sixty thousand?"
S04E04,JERRY,"oh, I d-I don't know. I d---"
S04E04,GEORGE,"Oh, gotta get fifty. Gotta get fifty. All right, I tell you what. We go to the coffee shop, you call your manager. Maybe they made an offer."
S04E04,JERRY,Okay.
S04E04,GEORGE,"(excited, pushing Jerry forward) All right, let's go, let's go, let's go, come on."
S04E04,GEORGE,Thirteen thousand?
S04E04,JERRY,Thirteen thousand.
S04E04,GEORGE,a piece?
S04E04,JERRY,"No, for both!"
S04E04,GEORGE,That's insulting! Ted Danson makes eight hundred thousand dollars an episode.
S04E04,JERRY,"Oh, would you stop with the Ted Danson?"
S04E04,GEORGE,"Well, he does."
S04E04,JERRY,You're nuts!
S04E04,GEORGE,I'm sorry. I can't live knowing Ted Danson makes that much more than me. Who is he?
S04E04,JERRY,He's somebody.
S04E04,GEORGE,What about me?
S04E04,JERRY,You're nobody.
S04E04,GEORGE,Why him? Why not me?
S04E04,JERRY,"He's good, you're not."
S04E04,GEORGE,I'm better than him.
S04E04,JERRY,"You're worse, much much worse. (crouches in booth) That's Davola!"
S04E04,GEORGE,(crouches too) What? Where? Where?
S04E04,JERRY,Outside! I saw him outside!
S04E04,ELAINE,what is it?
S04E04,BOYFRIEND,"Oh, it's this patient."
S04E04,ELAINE,(sighing) Again?
S04E04,BOYFRIEND,I'm fairly certain. I forgot to leave him an extra prescription for his medication.
S04E04,ELAINE,"Well, so, he can live without his Valium for a couple of days."
S04E04,BOYFRIEND,"Nah, you don't understand. He could be dangerous."
S04E04,JERRY,Go outside and see if he's still there.
S04E04,GEORGE,"I can't go out there, he knows we're friends."
S04E04,JERRY,"Well, what are we supposed to do? I gotta take Kramer to the doctor."
S04E04,GEORGE,Tell the cop.
S04E04,JERRY,Good idea.
S04E04,COP,"Yeah, all right. Just let me get a muffin."
S04E04,JERRY,Thanks.
S04E04,JERRY,(back in booth) He's gonna get a muffin and then he'll walk us outside. This is a great way to go through life.
S04E04,GEORGE,I thought you said he was gonna get a muffin.
S04E04,JERRY,(bossy) What are you doing?
S04E04,COP,What?
S04E04,JERRY,"What, are you ordering food now?"
S04E04,COP,"Yeah! Yeah, I decided to get a sandwich."
S04E04,JERRY,What happened to the muffin?
S04E04,COP,I got a little hungry.
S04E04,JERRY,All of a sudden you get hungry?
S04E04,COP,Yeah! You got a problem with that?
S04E04,JERRY,No! Enjoy your lunch.
S04E04,GEORGE,I thought he was just gonna have a muffin.
S04E04,JERRY,All of a sudden he gets hungry.
S04E04,GEORGE,"You know, a muffin can be very filling."
S04E04,JERRY,I know!
S04E04,NEWMAN,"(interrogating Kramer) Mister Kramer, you heard the testimony so far. Would you please tell the court in your own words what happened on the afternoon of September 10th?"
S04E04,KRAMER,What do you mean 'my own words'? Whose words are they gonna be?
S04E04,NEWMAN,You know what I mean.
S04E04,KRAMER,(to Judge) I was very upset that day.
S04E04,NEWMAN,And why was that?
S04E04,KRAMER,(to Newman) Would you let me say it? Let me talk!
S04E04,NEWMAN,"All right, all right. Go ahead, go ahead."
S04E04,KRAMER,All right.
S04E04,NEWMAN,Okay.
S04E04,KRAMER,(to Judge) I was very upset that day because I could never become a banker.
S04E04,NEWMAN,And that failure to become a banker was eating at you. Eating-eating-eating at you inside.
S04E04,KRAMER,"(not convincing) Uh, yeah."
S04E04,NEWMAN,"It was your family that pushed you into banking , it was their dream for you..."
S04E04,JUDGE,Mister Newman.
S04E04,NEWMAN,"Your Honor, I'm only trying to establish Mister Kramer's fragile emotional state, my entire case depends on it."
S04E04,JUDGE,"Uh, continue."
S04E04,NEWMAN,"As you were saying, Mister Kramer..."
S04E04,KRAMER,What was the question?
S04E04,NEWMAN,You're telling how your parents pushed you into banking.
S04E04,KRAMER,"Uh, well, my father when I was a kid, he took me to the bank and he lifted me up and he pointed to the teller and he said 'Sonny boy, take a good look at him, that's gonna be you some day.'"
S04E04,NEWMAN,"But you never became a banker, did you Mister Kramer? Why? Why did you fail?"
S04E04,KRAMER,I don't know.
S04E04,NEWMAN,It was because you hated your father and you would do anything to displease him. Isn't THAT true?
S04E04,JUDGE,"Uh, could you get to the speeding?"
S04E04,NEWMAN,"Yuh, yes. I intend to Your Honor. And then, on the afternoon of September 10th, you received a phone call did you not?"
S04E04,KRAMER,(puzzled) Phone call?
S04E04,NEWMAN,"Yes, a phone call!"
S04E04,KRAMER,From who?
S04E04,NEWMAN,From me!
S04E04,KRAMER,From you?
S04E04,NEWMAN,"Yes, from me!! I called you remember?"
S04E04,KRAMER,You called me?
S04E04,NEWMAN,"Yes, I called you, you idiot! Because you were going to... You were going to... Remember?"
S04E04,KRAMER,what?
S04E04,NEWMAN,You were going to...
S04E04,JUDGE,I'm afraid I'm gonna have to call a---
S04E04,NEWMAN,"Yes, the banker!!!"
S04E04,KRAMER,What banking?
S04E04,NEWMAN,"A banker! A banker! Your Honor, Your Honor, Your Honor..."
S04E04,JUDGE,That's enough already.
S04E04,NEWMAN,"Your Honor, Mister Kramer's obviously very distraught."
S04E04,KRAMER,I'm distraught!?! Wooh-wooh-hoo!
S04E04,NEWMAN,(to Kramer) You shut up! (to judge) I demand a recess so I can take him outside and help him regain hius composure.
S04E04,JUDGE,That'll be seventy-five dollars.
S04E04,NEWMAN,(Strangling Kramer) What's the matter with you? We had it all worked out!
S04E04,JERRY,Do you see him?
S04E04,GEORGE,I'm not* sure.
S04E04,JERRY,"Well, either you see him or you don't."
S04E04,GEORGE,All right. I don't.
S04E04,JERRY,(looking at the cop) What is he doing? Is he getting coffee? I think he's getting coffee.!
S04E04,GEORGE,What's with this guy?
S04E04,JERRY,(still bossy) Did you just order coffee?
S04E04,COP,Yeah.
S04E04,JERRY,This is really too much.
S04E04,COP,What is your problem?
S04E04,JERRY,"Well, I'm sitting over there waiting for you to finish your sandwich for twenty minutes. Now you're drinking coffee, that's gonna be another ten minutes."
S04E04,COP,"Well, you're just gonna have to wait."
S04E04,KRAMER,Never said anything about the banking.
S04E04,NEWMAN,You're off your rocker.
S04E04,JERRY,Hey you guys!
S04E04,KRAMER,Hey!
S04E04,JERRY,What are you doing here?
S04E04,KRAMER,What are YOU doing here?
S04E04,JERRY,"Hey, is Davola outside?"
S04E04,KRAMER,Davola?
S04E04,JERRY,Yeah.
S04E04,KRAMER,"No, I didn't see him."
S04E04,NEWMAN,Crazy Joe Davola?
S04E04,GEORGE,"(reading the tabs) Jerry, yours is eleven dollars."
S04E04,JERRY,Eleven dollars for what?
S04E04,GEORGE,"Muffin, sandwich and coffee!"
S04E04,JERRY,"(to Kramer) Hey, NBC okayed our idea. We're gonna make the pilot."
S04E04,KRAMER,"You're gonna do the circus freak show, uh?"
S04E04,JERRY,No.
S04E04,NEWMAN,Pilot? So what do you make for something like that? Fifty? Sixty thousand?
S04E04,GEORGE,What's the difference? The money is not important.
S04E04,JERRY,"(looking outside) Hey Newman, is that your red car?"
S04E04,NEWMAN,Yeah.
S04E04,JERRY,I think you're getting a ticket.
S04E04,NEWMAN,Deh!
S04E04,KRAMER,"Run, run! Go, go, go!"
S04E04,NEWMAN,"Hey! What are you doing? It's after six o'clock! You can't give me a ticket! Hey, you're not gonna get away with this. I'll fight this. I got witnesses."
S04E04,KRAMER,I saw the whole thing!
S04E04,JERRY,Maybe this whole thing would be a good idea for the pilot.
S04E04,GEORGE,"Ah, get outta here. The vomiting is much funnier."
S04E04,JERRY,"Oh, like you know what you're talking about!"
S04E04,GEORGE,"No, YOU do!"
S04E05,JERRY,So George and I went up to NBC and we told them the idea for a series now we're just waiting to sign the contract.
S04E05,HELEN,And they liked the idea?
S04E05,JERRY,Yeah.
S04E05,MORTY,What'ya got leather seats here?
S04E05,HELEN,Since when is George a writer?
S04E05,JERRY,What writer? It's a sitcom.
S04E05,HELEN,This is so exciting. When are you going to sign the contract?
S04E05,JERRY,"Soon, there's a couple of problems."
S04E05,MORTY,"Jerry, I wanna tell you that meal was the worst."
S04E05,JERRY,What do you expect? It's airline food.
S04E05,MORTY,They give you that *Fish.*
S04E05,JERRY,How could you eat fish on a plane?
S04E05,MORTY,because she puts up such a big stink every time I have a piece of meat.
S04E05,HELEN,What kind of problems?
S04E05,JERRY,"Well, George doesn't think $13,000 is enough money."
S04E05,HELEN,What? He's not even working.
S04E05,MORTY,George is right. Those people will try to get away with murder. Believe me. They're all crooks.
S04E05,HELEN,"Jerry, I want you to sign that contract."
S04E05,JERRY,We're going to sign it. We're going to sign it. In fact George is out with the woman from NBC right now.
S04E05,GEORGE,"So, I'm uh, I'm afraid we're going to have to pass."
S04E05,SUSAN,Yu - you're passing?
S04E05,GEORGE,"Well, it's . . . much too low."
S04E05,SUSAN,Are you and Jerry in complete agreement on this?
S04E05,GEORGE,"tsh (snorts) Ah, yeah, we've - we've talked . . . I believe I can speak for the both of us on this."
S04E05,SUSAN,"Well be-because you know that, because this is your first show it's a pretty standard deal."
S04E05,GEORGE,Standard?
S04E05,SUSAN,Yeah.
S04E05,GEORGE,Is Ted Danson's deal standard?
S04E05,SUSAN,Ted Danson?
S04E05,GEORGE,"You know, the guy from Cheers."
S04E05,SUSAN,"Yeah, I know who he is. (laughs) You're not Ted Danson."
S04E05,GEORGE,I didn't say I was Ted Danson.
S04E05,SUSAN,"All right, I'll tell Russell tomorrow."
S04E05,GEORGE,You tell Russell.
S04E05,SUSAN,"Oh, um, before I forget, . . . Cuban cigars. It's a present from my father."
S04E05,GEORGE,Oh... do I have to write him a note or something?
S04E05,SUSAN,"Yeah, I am sure he'd appreciated that."
S04E05,GEORGE,Well what would I say in the note?
S04E05,SUSAN,"Ah, you're a writer. You'll think of something."
S04E05,GEORGE,"Oh-ohf (snorts) yeah, I'm a writer. (laughs)"
S04E05,HELEN,Were you waiting long at the gate?
S04E05,JERRY,"Um, I don't even know?"
S04E05,HELEN,Where's that watch we bought you?
S04E05,JERRY,Oh uh ...
S04E05,JERRY,That's enough with this piece of junk I've had it. (throws watch in garbage)
S04E05,GEORGE,Wha-Is that the one your parents gave you?
S04E05,JERRY,"Yeah, but it never works."
S04E05,JERRY,". . . it's uh, being fixed."
S04E05,MORTY,"I got a guarantee on that watch. Give it to me, I'll take it back to where we got it."
S04E05,JERRY,It's at the jeweler.
S04E05,MORTY,You send me the bill.
S04E05,JERRY,I'm not sending you the bill.
S04E05,HELEN,That watch was a gift. You shouldn't have to pay for it.
S04E05,GAS STATION ATTENDANT,"That's uh, $18.50."
S04E05,MORTY,"Here, I got it."
S04E05,JERRY,What are you talking about? It's my car. Let me pay for the gas.
S04E05,MORTY,"No, no put it away . . ."
S04E05,JERRY,Dad!
S04E05,MORTY,Stop it.
S04E05,JERRY,I have money. I make money.
S04E05,MORTY,"Yeah, yeah, you make money."
S04E05,JERRY,You don't think I make money. That's what you think isn't it?
S04E05,HELEN,"No, I don't think that."
S04E05,JERRY,Yes you do. That's what you both think.
S04E05,MORTY,I'm paying.
S04E05,JERRY,Dad I'm paying.
S04E05,MORTY,Get out of here.
S04E05,JERRY,You're not paying.
S04E05,MORTY,"Now Jerry please, do not do this to your father. Over my dead body Jerry. I'll tell you right now, you're not going to do it."
S04E05,JERRY,No don't do this. You're not doing this. I will fight you. No you don't... No.
S04E05,JERRY,"Boy, you got a lot of stuff here. . . . Dad, what are you doing?"
S04E05,MORTY,Nothing nothing.
S04E05,JERRY,Leave it. What about your back?
S04E05,HELEN,"Morty, what are you doing?"
S04E05,MORTY,"All right, all right."
S04E05,JERRY,You come all the way up here to see a back specialist and you're lifting heavy suit cases.
S04E05,KRAMER,"Hey, Morty."
S04E05,MORTY,"Hey, Mr. Kramer. Ha ha ha."
S04E05,KRAMER,"Hey, Mrs. Seinfeld. Hi"
S04E05,HELEN,"Ha, ha, ha Oh, What happened to you?"
S04E05,KRAMER,"Oh, ah, well some guy kicked me in the side of the head."
S04E05,HELEN,What guy?
S04E05,KRAMER,"Ah, w-Crazy Joe Devola."
S04E05,HELEN,Why?
S04E05,KRAMER,"Well, I was having this party and I didn't invite him and then Jerry, tipped him off."
S04E05,JERRY,Why did you tell this crazy guy that Kramer didn't invite him to his party?
S04E05,JERRY,I didn't know he wasn't invited.
S04E05,MORTY,"Hey, these are very comfortable pants. You know what I paid for these Jerry?"
S04E05,HELEN,So why did you say anything?
S04E05,JERRY,It was a mistake.
S04E05,MORTY,They're good around the house -- and they're good for outside.
S04E05,HELEN,Are you okay?
S04E05,KRAMER,"Oh, yeah, yeah. I was a little off last week, huh Jerry -- Yeah but the doctor says it was just a slight concussion"
S04E05,HELEN,So what's the matter with this Devola guy?
S04E05,JERRY,He's got like a chemical imbalance. He needs to be on medication.
S04E05,KRAMER,"Oh, yeah, yeah. He's after Jerry now."
S04E05,JERRY,Kramer!!
S04E05,HELEN,He's what?!
S04E05,JERRY,He's joking.
S04E05,HELEN,He's after you?
S04E05,JERRY,Nooo.
S04E05,HELEN,Why is he after you?
S04E05,JERRY,He's not after me.
S04E05,HELEN,"Morty, do you here this? Some crazy guy is after Jerry."
S04E05,MORTY,I'll make a few phone calls.
S04E05,JERRY,Who you gonna to call?
S04E05,MORTY,What are you worried about?
S04E05,HELEN,I want to know what you did to this guy that he's after you.
S04E05,JERRY,I didn't do anything.
S04E05,HELEN,Well you must have done something.
S04E05,JERRY,"No, he just doesn't like me."
S04E05,HELEN,Doesn't like you? How could anyone not like you?
S04E05,JERRY,You know it seems impossible.
S04E05,HELEN,Doesn't - doesn't like you? How could that be?
S04E05,JERRY,"Ma, I know this may be hard for you to understand but I am sure there are many people who do not like me."
S04E05,HELEN,"Huh, Jerry, don't say that."
S04E05,JERRY,It's true.
S04E05,HELEN,"No, it isn't! it's not true. You're a wonderful, wonderful boy. Everybody likes you. It's impossible not to like you. Impossible. Morty?"
S04E05,MORTY,Maybe some people don't like him. I could see that.
S04E05,HELEN,Kramer?
S04E05,KRAMER,"Yeah, I like him. Hey Jerry, what time you got?"
S04E05,JERRY,"Um, I haven't got my watch on. It's being fixed."
S04E05,KRAMER,When you getting it back?
S04E05,JERRY,"Uh, next week."
S04E05,KRAMER,Next week? How come it's takin' so long?
S04E05,JERRY,Huh?
S04E05,KRAMER,I said how come it's takin' so long?
S04E05,JERRY,"I don't know. They're, backed up."
S04E05,KRAMER,"Wait a minute, wait a minute, where did you take it?"
S04E05,JERRY,Where'd I take it?
S04E05,KRAMER,Yeah.
S04E05,JERRY,"Where did I take it? Where Did I Take It? (stabbing a knife into a cutting board) Umm, to that place on, uh Columbus and 85th. Okay?"
S04E05,KRAMER,What? Jimmy Sherman?
S04E05,JERRY,Yeah.
S04E05,KRAMER,"Yeah, I know the guy. I take my stuff in there all the time. Yeah, I bet I can get your watch back by tomorrow morning."
S04E05,JERRY,"No, Kramer, I don't want you to say anything to him."
S04E05,KRAMER,"No, I'd be happy to. He's a friend of mine."
S04E05,JERRY,I'd like to follow the regular procedures. I don't want any special treatment.
S04E05,KRAMER,"Hey, I'm going to get that watch back for you by tomorrow, buddy. You see."
S04E05,MORTY,Bring me the receipt.
S04E05,KRAMER,I get that too. (exits)
S04E05,JERRY,Be right back. (follows Kramer out)
S04E05,JERRY,"There's no watch ... I threw it in the garbage can on the street. It didn't keep good time. My parents gave it to me, but I didn't like it. So don't mention it again, okay!"
S04E05,KRAMER,"Y-Yeah, all right."
S04E05,JERRY,All right.
S04E05,KRAMER,"Wait, wait, . . .y-yea, w-no dit dit g- (Kramer noises)"
S04E05,HELEN,What was that about?
S04E05,KRAMER,"Oh, no, uh, he's got my Calamine lotion and uh, I told him not to return it. If he needs it he should keep it. He's got uh, he's got a thing on his ankle."
S04E05,HELEN,How can anyone not like him.
S04E05,MORTY,"Hi, Morty Seinfeld. I have a two o'clock appointment."
S04E05,RECEPTIONIST,"Yes, Mr. Seinfeld. Would you please fill this out."
S04E05,MORTY,All this? This whole thing? It's going to take me forty-five minutes.
S04E05,RECEPTIONIST,I know. It's very long.
S04E05,MORTY,Look at this. It's a book. Employer's address. Whydo they need this? You know I never had a back problem until that night I slept on the convertible sofa. (hu hu) My back was fine.
S04E05,HELEN,"Well, it's not the sofa."
S04E05,MORTY,You stick up for that sofa like I'm criticizing a person.
S04E05,HELEN,We got it from Sullivan's. It's a good store.
S04E05,MORTY,Well one day somebody's going to sleep on that thing and we'll get sued. I hope this doctor knows what he's doing.
S04E05,HELEN,Leo says he's the best there is.
S04E05,MORTY,"Leo, I'm listening to Leo now!"
S04E05,HELEN,Well you're lucky he was able to get you this appointment. You know what the waiting list is for this guy?
S04E05,MORTY,"Well, if he fixes my back I'll be happy. . . . (back to the form) Have you ever had a sexually transmitted disease? That's IT! . . . Here, you got my name, you got my address. That's enough."
S04E05,RECEPTIONIST,"Julie, you want to take him back?"
S04E05,JERRY,You what? You passed? How could you do that?
S04E05,GEORGE,"ahhhhh (exhaling) Jerry, my young friend, you're so nave. You are so, so nave. You know about a few things. You know about comedy, a little bit about relationships, some baseball, but you are so far out of your element here, you are embarrassing yourself. Now listen to me. I'm negotiating. Negotiation, this is what'cha do in business."
S04E05,JERRY,"Let me explain to you what you just did. There are literally hundreds of people trying to get pilot deals with them this year. They go with maybe, five. Okay, if we pass, that's it. They go to the next show."
S04E05,GEORGE,"Ooooo, I'm scared. . . . Ohoooo they're not going to do the show."
S04E05,JERRY,"We're lucky they're even interested in the idea in the first place. We got a show about nothing. With no story. What do you think, they're up there going, hey maybe we should give those two guys, who have no experience and no idea, more money!?"
S04E05,GEORGE,Ohooo what are we going to do? I'm shaking! I'm shaking!
S04E05,JERRY,"Well, I think you're wrong."
S04E05,GEORGE,"Well, we'll just see."
S04E05,JERRY,Yes we will.
S04E05,GEORGE,Yes we will.
S04E05,JERRY,I just said that.
S04E05,GEORGE,I know you did.
S04E05,JERRY,So good for you.
S04E05,GEORGE,So good for you.
S04E05,JERRY,What are you repeating everything I'm saying?
S04E05,GEORGE,What are you repeating everything I'm saying?
S04E05,JERRY,Well George is an idiot.
S04E05,GEORGE,Well George . . . .
S04E05,MORTY,"All right, all right, Let's go already. They keep you in here a year. They don't give a damn. I could die in here. . . .(open the door and shouts into the hallway) Excuse me! Excuse me! What's going on? I'm here twenty minutes. Could somebody please help me."
S04E05,HELEN,(enters) Shhh. Quiet! Everyone can hear you.
S04E05,MORTY,Twenty minutes. I've been waiting twenty minutes.
S04E05,HELEN,Well the doctor must be busy.
S04E05,MORTY,"Well then what do they make appointments for if they can't keep them. Huh, hha. Look if I did that in my business I wouldn't have made a nickel."
S04E05,NURSE,"Hello, Mr. Seinfeld."
S04E05,MORTY,I thought you forgot about me.
S04E05,NURSE,We didn't forget.
S04E05,MORTY,HaAhhh! The Velcro. I can't stand Velcro. It's that t-e-a-r-I-n-g sound. I used to be in raincoats. I refused to put that in any of my lines.
S04E05,NURSE,"Okay, Mr. Seinfeld, please come this way. We need some X-rays."
S04E05,MORTY,Leave all my stuff here?
S04E05,NURSE,Leave it.
S04E05,GEORGE,"Oh hey, by the way. Do you want a box 'a, Cuban cigars? I smoked one last night. I got nauseous."
S04E05,JERRY,No I don't want ?em.
S04E05,KRAMER,"I'll take it. No, I'll take it. What is it?"
S04E05,GEORGE,Here you go.
S04E05,KRAMER,Cigars? (hits the box)
S04E05,GEORGE,"Yeah, Cubans."
S04E05,KRAMER,"Oh, yeah?"
S04E05,GEORGE,"Yeah, the kind that Castro smoked. You can't buy ?em anywhere."
S04E05,KRAMER,Castro eh? Pasto costillo homiga (nonsense Spanish)
S04E05,JERRY,Yeah?
S04E05,VOICE,Federal Express.
S04E05,JERRY,Federal Express? Come on up. . . . Federal Express. I'm not expecting a package.
S04E05,KRAMER,"Wooo, you know what you just did? You let a burglar in the building."
S04E05,JERRY,You think so?
S04E05,KRAMER,Federal Express? Of course. That's the oldest trick in the book. You know it might not be a burglar it could be a murderer.
S04E05,JERRY,So you want to just abolish all home package deliveries.
S04E05,KRAMER,Yes. It's dangerous.
S04E05,KRAMER,wait det doit ... dit (Kramer noises -- he prepares for a fight by rolling up a magazine)
S04E05,JERRY,Who is it?
S04E05,Voice,Federal Express.
S04E05,KRAMER,"Okay, ... gidg gi gt (backs up and bends his knees, holding the rolled magazine - arm back, ready for a rumble)"
S04E05,ALL,Hiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiii!
S04E05,KRAMER,I want one of those!
S04E05,ELAINE,Hiiii Kramer
S04E05,KRAMER,Oh yes
S04E05,ELAINE,"Kramer, Hi, I thought you went to California."
S04E05,KRAMER,Well I came back for you.
S04E05,ELAINE,"Oh, shut up (pushes Kramer)"
S04E05,JERRY,I missed you.
S04E05,ELAINE,Really? You really missed me?
S04E05,JERRY,"Yeah, . . . seriously."
S04E05,GEORGE,"Yeah, yeah, me to miss -- I miss."
S04E05,JERRY,"Yeah, big missing goin' on (spreads arms wide)"
S04E05,ELAINE,Ahhhhhh haa ha ha
S04E05,KRAMER,"Hey, I'm going to be right back. I'm going to get a match."
S04E05,ELAINE,"Oh god, Who's suitcase is this?"
S04E05,JERRY,"Oh, it's my parents. My father came up to see a back specialist."
S04E05,ELAINE,"Oh, god, it's probably from sleeping on that sofa."
S04E05,GEORGE,"Boy, you look really great."
S04E05,JERRY,Yeah.
S04E05,ELAINE,You lie.
S04E05,GEORGE,"No, no you really look great."
S04E05,ELAINE,"Hu hu, ha ha ha."
S04E05,JERRY,So tell us about the trip. How's Dr. Reston?
S04E05,ELAINE,"Oh, he's fine."
S04E05,JERRY,Things are good?
S04E05,ELAINE,"Yeah, you know (scratches cheek and sniffs)"
S04E05,JERRY,Uh oh.
S04E05,ELAINE,"What, Uh oh?"
S04E05,JERRY,Did you see that?
S04E05,GEORGE,"Yeah, I saw it."
S04E05,ELAINE,What?
S04E05,JERRY,It's a tell. You gotta tell.
S04E05,ELAINE,What tell? What's a tell?
S04E05,JERRY,"When you ask someone about their relationship and they touch their face, you know it's not going too well. Go ahead ask me how it's going with somebody."
S04E05,ELAINE,"Um, uh, who's it going with, uh, Alice?"
S04E05,JERRY,"Good, going good (scratches chin) And the higher up on the face you go the worse the relationship is getting. You know it is like - pretty good - not bad - I gotta get out. (scratches chin, nose then covers eyes with hands)"
S04E05,ELAINE,How high did I go?
S04E05,GEORGE,You almost did the nose.
S04E05,JERRY,What are you eating my peanut butter out of the jar with your disgusting index fingers? This is a sickening display. (takes the peanut butter jar away from George)
S04E05,GEORGE,What? I'm not eating bread now. I'm off bread.
S04E05,JERRY,(To George) You're off bread. (To Elaine) So what happened is it over?
S04E05,ELAINE,No not quite.
S04E05,JERRY,Why not?
S04E05,ELAINE,"Well he was my psychiatrist, you know. I mean, he knows all my patterns. He knows In relationships that I always try to find some reason to leave, and so, he says as my doctor, he can't allow me to do this, so he's not letting me leave."
S04E05,GEORGE,"What do you mean - ""Not letting you?"""
S04E05,ELAINE,"He has this power over me, okay. I mean he has this way of manipulating every little word that I say. He's like a Svenjolly."
S04E05,JERRY,Svengali.
S04E05,ELAINE,What did I say?
S04E05,JERRY,Svenjolly.
S04E05,ELAINE,Svenjolly? I did not say Svenjolly.
S04E05,JERRY,George?
S04E05,GEORGE,Svenjolly. (licking a little bit of peanut butter from his finger)
S04E05,ELAINE,I don't see how I could have said Svenjolly.
S04E05,JERRY,"Well maybe he's got like a, cheerful mental hold on you."
S04E05,KRAMER,You know I can't find a match anywhere.
S04E05,GEORGE,You know what you should do? You should tell this guy you're seeing somebody else. That's the easiest way to get out of these things.
S04E05,ELAINE,"No, it's not going to work with this guy."
S04E05,GEORGE,"No, you just tell him ah, an old boyfriend has come back into your life."
S04E05,ELAINE,I don't think so.
S04E05,JERRY,Nice try.
S04E05,GEORGE,Took a shot.
S04E05,KRAMER,"This is a good cigar (hair is on fire, white smoke pouring from the back of his head) . . . . . . WOOOOOOOOOOW . . . (runs to bathroom, his arms in the air -- he bangs them in to the top of the hallway door jam and falls into the bathroom)"
S04E05,MORTY,"So, when do I get to see the doctor?"
S04E05,NURSE,He'll be in with the X-Rays in a few minutes. You can get dressed. (leaves)
S04E05,MORTY,"(checking pants) They stole my wallet. The bum stole my wallet. (opens door, shouts into the hallway) MY WALLET'S GONE! MY WALLET'S GONE! I had my wallet in my back pocket. It's gone."
S04E05,NURSE,Are you sure?
S04E05,MORTY,"Yes, I'm sure. I went in to get my X-Ray, Somebody takes my wallet. Is that the operation here?"
S04E05,DR. DEMBROW,"Mr. Seinfeld, I'm Dr. Dembrow, I've been going over your X-rays."
S04E05,MORTY,I'm not interested in the X-Rays. I want my money back. Somebody stole my wallet. I had $225 in there.
S04E05,DR. DEMBROW,"Well, I don't see how something like that could have happened."
S04E05,MORTY,"Oh, you don't see. You don't see. Well it happened. Believe me."
S04E05,HELEN,(enters) What's going on?
S04E05,MORTY,They stole my wallet.
S04E05,HELEN,What?
S04E05,MORTY,"Yeah, while I was in getting X-Rayed."
S04E05,DR. DEMBROW,"All right, Mr. Seinfeld, I am sorry about your wallet but would you like me to look over these X-Rays?"
S04E05,MORTY,What kind of clip joint are ya running here?
S04E05,DR. DEMBROW,"All right, fine. (leaves)"
S04E05,HELEN,The least you could have done was heard your diagnosis.
S04E05,MORTY,I am not interested in his diagnosis. He's a bum.
S04E05,HELEN,You came all the way from Florida to see him.
S04E05,MORTY,I want to know what kind of an office this is where you can't leave your pants in the room. You tell me.
S04E05,ELAINE,I'm sorry but there's somebody else.
S04E05,DR. RESTON,Umm hm.
S04E05,ELAINE,"Well it's, nothing I planned on happening, you know. It just, kind of happened."
S04E05,DR. RESTON,Tell me about him.
S04E05,ELAINE,"Well, there's not really much to tell, you know, he's just a guy, Really."
S04E05,DR. RESTON,"Yes, well I assumed he's a guy."
S04E05,ELAINE,Right...
S04E05,DR. RESTON,And you've known him how long?
S04E05,ELAINE,". . . Years. Many years (her voice cracks), um, (clears throat) we've been close friends and then recently something just you know *ehghh* happened."
S04E05,DR. RESTON,You mean sexually?
S04E05,ELAINE,"Yeah, yeah. Sexu-ally."
S04E05,ELAINE,I think your um ... (points at the phone)
S04E05,DR. RESTON,"Excuse me. Yes, Oh yes, Bobo. Uh, no it's just east of Madison. Around 400 will be fine. All right Bobo ... see you then. (hangs up) . . . I'm sorry where were we?"
S04E05,ELAINE,"Well, I was just um, telling you about this, other guy."
S04E05,DR. RESTON,Mm. Elaine ...
S04E05,ELAINE,Yeah
S04E05,DR. RESTON,"Do you remember your dream, where you have a sexual encounter with a Chinese woman?"
S04E05,ELAINE,"Yeah. Yeah, (cough, cough) Mm-hm."
S04E05,DR. RESTON,"Elaine, I'm concerned about you."
S04E05,ELAINE,"Oh, no no no no, don't concern yourself with me, because I'm - I'm good. I'm - I'm very good, I mean I'm really very, very good."
S04E05,DR. RESTON,Elaine. Have you been urinating a lot again?
S04E05,ELAINE,. . . no.
S04E05,DR. RESTON,"And how often have you been seeing, um . . .? I'm sorry what is his name?"
S04E05,ELAINE,H-his name?
S04E05,DR. RESTON,"Yes, his name."
S04E05,ELAINE,"Um, well what's the difference?"
S04E05,DR. RESTON,Are you afraid to tell me his name?
S04E05,ELAINE,"No, no, I just - I just don't see how that's relevant."
S04E05,DR. RESTON,It doesn't matter if you don't see how. I see how.
S04E05,ELAINE,"Uh, his name, um, I don't - I don't even know, all right you want to know his name? I'll - I'll tell you his name. His name is . . . Kramer."
S04E05,DR. RESTON,Kramer. Is that his first name or his last name?
S04E05,ELAINE,"Oh, I'm - I'm really uncomfortable talking about this."
S04E05,DR. RESTON,"Elaine, I want you to do me a favor."
S04E05,ELAINE,What?
S04E05,DR. RESTON,I want you to tell this young man to give me a call. It's very important that I speak to him.
S04E05,ELAINE,"Oh, oh no, no no no, I can't do that."
S04E05,DR. RESTON,You can do it and you will do it.
S04E05,ELAINE,"No, I can't."
S04E05,DR. RESTON,You can and you will.
S04E05,ELAINE,"Okay, okay. Yeah I'll have Kramer give you a call."
S04E05,JERRY,So you didn't even let the doctor treat you?
S04E05,MORTY,I wouldn't give him the satisfaction.
S04E05,HELEN,Why did you leave your wallet in your pants?
S04E05,MORTY,What are you talking about? What was I supposed to hide it somewhere?
S04E05,HELEN,You could've taken it with you.
S04E05,MORTY,"Oh, yeah, I'll be lying on an X-Ray table with my wallet in my mouth."
S04E05,LEO,Hello...
S04E05,JERRY,Hi Uncle Leo.
S04E05,LEO,I just talked to Dr. Dembrow's son. He said they almost had to call the police.
S04E05,MORTY,What are you talking about? I'm the one who should have called the police. They stole my wallet.
S04E05,LEO,You know how hard it was for me to get that appointment for you? You can't just walk in on this guy. He did me a personal favor.
S04E05,MORTY,"All right, Leo."
S04E05,LEO,And you walked out without paying.
S04E05,MORTY,How was I supposed to pay? I didn't have my wallet.
S04E05,LEO,"Well, I hope you send him a check."
S04E05,MORTY,What for?
S04E05,LEO,What for? This man was nice enough to see you. He did me a personal favor.
S04E05,MORTY,"That's the second time you said ""personal favor"". Why do you keep saying that?"
S04E05,LEO,I said it once.
S04E05,MORTY,Twice! And Dembrow doesn't even know you. His son happens to live on your floor.
S04E05,HELEN,"Leo, where did you get that watch?"
S04E05,LEO,You know where I got this? (flashback) I found it in the garbage can. It kept terrible time. I brought it over to Jimmy Sherman right here on 85th and Columbus. Gave it to me back the next day. Works great. What kind of idiot throws a way a perfectly good watch?
S04E05,HELEN,"Morty, doesn't that watch look like the one that we gave Jerry."
S04E05,JERRY,"Hey, where's the waiter. Dad, what say we have some red meat tonight. Let's live a little. ."
S04E05,HELEN,Let me see that.
S04E05,JERRY,Could we continue this another time.
S04E06,"(The episode opens with a series of clips from 'The Pitch', 'The Ticket' and 'TheWallet', illustrating the story so far. A rough precis would be","George turns down the offer from NBC for the show, telling Jerry he's negotiating. Susan gives George a box of Cuban cigars from her father, which hepasses to Kramer, who sets fire to his hair while lighting one. Jerry's parents come to town, so's Morty can see a back specialist - he slept on the fold-out. Kramer tells Jerry's parents that Crazy Joe Davola is after Jerry. Jerry throws away a watch his parents gave him, because it doesn't keep time. Uncle Leo fetches it out of the garbage. Jerry tells his parents his watch is at the jeweller for repair. At the doctor's, Morty reveals his hatred of velcro and his wallet disappears. Elaine returns from Europe, eager to rid herself of the 'Svenjolly' Dr Reston. George tells her to inform the doctor she's seeing someone else. Elaine opts to say she's seeing Kramer, and Dr Reston wants to meet him.)"
S04E06,JERRY,"It's an entire industry of bad gifts, aren't they? All those executive gifts, any stupid, goofy, brass, wood thing, they put a piece of green felt on the bottom. ""It's a golf, desk, tie and stress organiser, dad."" But to me, nothing compares with the paperweight as a bad gift. There's no better way than a paperweight, to express to someone that, ""I refuse to put any thought into this at all."" Where are these people working that the papers are just blowing right off of their desks? What, are their desks screwed to the back of a flat-bed truck going down the highway or something? What, are they typing up in the crow's nest of a clipper ship? What do you need a paperweight for?"
S04E06,MORTY,"(to Leo) I don't understand this jeweller, Jimmy Sherman. (indicates Jerry) He brings in a watch, it takes over a week to fix. He fixed yours in one day."
S04E06,JERRY,"Oh, you know these jewellers, they're enigmas. They're mysteries, wrapped in a riddle."
S04E06,HELEN,(indicating to Jerry) She's very attractive.
S04E06,JERRY,She's okay.
S04E06,HELEN,Just okay?
S04E06,JERRY,She's nice.
S04E06,HELEN,She's better than nice.
S04E06,JERRY,She's all right.
S04E06,HELEN,She's beautiful.
S04E06,JERRY,She's not beautiful.
S04E06,HELEN,I think she's beautiful.
S04E06,JERRY,So you ask her out.
S04E06,HELEN,I'm not gonna ask her out.
S04E06,JERRY,Why not?
S04E06,HELEN,"If you don't think she's beautiful, there's something wrong with you."
S04E06,JERRY,She's pretty. She's not beautiful.
S04E06,HELEN,I should drop dead if she's not beautiful.
S04E06,JERRY,I think that's a little extreme.
S04E06,LEO,(grudgingly) She's awright.
S04E06,MORTY,"(oblivious to the above) Two exact same watches. He tells you a week, and him a day. How could that be? Something's fishy about this."
S04E06,GEORGE,He said what?
S04E06,SUSAN,"""The hell with them."""
S04E06,GEORGE,"""The hell with them?"""
S04E06,SUSAN,Those were his exact words.
S04E06,GEORGE,(worried) Oh boy.
S04E06,SUSAN,"He said, ""We've got five hundred shows to choose from. Why should we give two guys, who have no idea, and no experience, more money?"""
S04E06,GEORGE,(still worried) He was pretty emphatic?
S04E06,SUSAN,Pounded on his desk.
S04E06,GEORGE,Pounded?
S04E06,SUSAN,(tossing her purse on the dash) I told you to take the offer.
S04E06,GEORGE,"(getting animated) Look I, I uh, I had nothing to do with this. It wasn't my decision. It was Jerry! Jerry told me no. I'm the creative guy. He handles the business end."
S04E06,SUSAN,You said it was insulting.
S04E06,GEORGE,"I was quoting him. Why would I be insulted? I'm never insulted. You could call me baldy, dump soup on my head. Nothing insults me."
S04E06,SUSAN,"Well, there's nothing I can do."
S04E06,GEORGE,"Well, don't they make a counter offer? How can they just cancel the whole deal like that? What kind of a maniac is this guy? I mean he just, he says no, and that's it?"
S04E06,SUSAN,"Yeah, that's the way Russell is. He doesn't like to play games."
S04E06,GEORGE,"Well, he has to play! He can't just not play. We're playing! Look, I gotta see him, how do I get in touch with him?"
S04E06,SUSAN,You'll have to wait til Monday.
S04E06,GEORGE,"Mon...? No, no, I can't wait til Monday, that's impossible, I gotta talk to him now. Where does he live?"
S04E06,SUSAN,(laugh) I can't give you his address.
S04E06,SUSAN,Give it back!
S04E06,GEORGE,Gimme the purse!
S04E06,ELAINE,"Okay, so he just wants to talk to you. I couldn't talk him out of it. So you just tell him that you're my boyfriend and that we're in love, okay. Can you do that?"
S04E06,KRAMER,"Yeah, yeah, okay. I'm your boyfriend."
S04E06,ELAINE,Okay.
S04E06,KRAMER,Have we been intimate?
S04E06,ELAINE,"Yeah. Yeah, we've been intimate."
S04E06,KRAMER,"Alright, how often do we do it?"
S04E06,ELAINE,"Kramer, how is that important? Honestly, do you really think he's gonna ask you that?"
S04E06,KRAMER,"Elaine, he's a psychiatrist. They're interested in stuff like that."
S04E06,ELAINE,"Alright, alright. We do it, uh... (thinks) five times a week, okay?"
S04E06,KRAMER,"(suggestive) Oooh, baby. (smiles)"
S04E06,ELAINE,"Oh, man. Alright, listen. Just tell me something, what are you gonna say?"
S04E06,KRAMER,I know what I'm gonna say.
S04E06,ELAINE,"No, no, but I would like to hear it."
S04E06,KRAMER,"No, no. I don't wanna say it out loud. Kills the spontaneity. You know, Gleason, he never rehearsed. (indicates phone) 'Kay, go 'head, do it."
S04E06,ELAINE,"(dialling) Alright, okay. You talk to him."
S04E06,KRAMER,(playing with his hair) Talk to him.
S04E06,ELAINE,"Hey, how's your hair?"
S04E06,KRAMER,"Oh, well, yeah, it's good."
S04E06,ELAINE,"(handing over the phone) You're not the type that should be playing with matches, seriously Kramer."
S04E06,KRAMER,"(listens) Uh, yes. Uh uh, Doctor uh, Reston, is he in? Well, this is Kramer and uh, he's expecting my call."
S04E06,ELAINE,(mouths silently) Okay.
S04E06,KRAMER,(singing) ...Johnny ...was a rebel. He rode through the land...
S04E06,KRAMER,"...Yu uh, yes, yes uh, uh, Doctor Reston. Uhm well, hello there. Ahh yeah, well, I'm a good friend of Elaine's..."
S04E06,ELAINE,"(animated, but quietly) No, no. Not friends."
S04E06,KRAMER,"...Well, actually uh, we're uh, we're not friends Uh, we're uh, we're much more than friends..."
S04E06,KRAMER,"...and uh, I'm afraid we have a bit of a problem. Well, the point is, doctor uh, I'm very much in love with Elaine..."
S04E06,KRAMER,"...and uh, she's very much in love with me, and uh, well uh, we would uh, appreciate it if you would cease and desist, and allow us to pursue our courtship unfettered."
S04E06,ELAINE,(mouths silently) That's perfect!
S04E06,KRAMER,"If not, I can assure you, doctor, that I can make things very unpleasant for you and your staff. If you have one."
S04E06,KRAMER,"Yes. Yeah, but the point that I... (listens)"
S04E06,KRAMER,"...Ah, ye... (listens) Well, no... Uh, yeah, that's possible..."
S04E06,KRAMER,"(listens) ...Well, I suppose I could, (turns away from Elaine) but I'd have to shift a few things around, uhm... Hold on for a second, will you? Uh..."
S04E06,KRAMER,"... Uh, go ahead, yeah. (listens and makes a note) Alright uh... Yeah, yeah, okay... I look forward to it too. (listens) Eh, hah, okay. So long."
S04E06,ELAINE,What happened? What'd he say? (indicates pad) What's going on here?
S04E06,KRAMER,"Uh, okay now. He uh, you know, he uh, wants to get together."
S04E06,ELAINE,(horrified) Get together!!
S04E06,KRAMER,He wants to talk.
S04E06,ELAINE,"Well, why didn't you say no!!"
S04E06,KRAMER,(momentary confusion) Wha...? Uh... (thoughtful) That's interesting.
S04E06,ELAINE,(frustration) Ugh!
S04E06,NAOMI,Did you enjoy your poisson?
S04E06,HELEN,It was... different.
S04E06,NAOMI,(to Jerry) And how was yours?
S04E06,JERRY,"Ah, very good."
S04E06,NAOMI,You should try our mousse. (a little flirtatious) It'll change your life expectancy.
S04E06,JERRY,"No thanks, just the check."
S04E06,HELEN,What's the matter with you?
S04E06,JERRY,What?
S04E06,HELEN,Why didn't you flirt with her?
S04E06,JERRY,Come on.
S04E06,HELEN,She was flirting with you. Why didn't you say something?
S04E06,JERRY,What am I gonna say?
S04E06,HELEN,You just sat there.
S04E06,JERRY,"Well, you made me uncomfortable."
S04E06,HELEN,"You're a comedian, couldn't you come up with something?"
S04E06,LEO,(to Morty) Where's the bathroom?
S04E06,JERRY,"In the back, on your right."
S04E06,JERRY,Dad!
S04E06,MORTY,Will you stop it Jerry. Let go.
S04E06,HELEN,Jerry.
S04E06,JERRY,Will you let me pay just once.
S04E06,MORTY,You're out of your mind.
S04E06,JERRY,How you gonna pay? You don't even have a wallet!
S04E06,MORTY,Don't worry about it.
S04E06,JERRY,What're you gonna do?
S04E06,MORTY,"What's the difference, we'll figure something out."
S04E06,HELEN,(to Jerry) You're not paying.
S04E06,JERRY,"Alright, fine. You figure something out. I'd be very curious to know how you pick up a check with no money. 'Cause if this works, the whole monetary system's obsolete, we're back to wampum. (standing) I'm going to the bathroom."
S04E06,MORTY,How the hell am I gonna pay for this?
S04E06,LEO,"They give you some portion here, huh?"
S04E06,JERRY,"Uh, yeah. (broaching a subject) Hey uncle Leo, I hope I wasn't uh, rude to you that day I bumped into you on the street. Uh, I really did have to get to a meeting."
S04E06,LEO,"(preening himself in the mirror) Aw, no, no, I understand. I got plenty of friends in showbusiness. I know you're all very busy."
S04E06,JERRY,"So you found that watch in the garbage can, huh?"
S04E06,LEO,Yeah. In fact it was right after I ran into you.
S04E06,JERRY,"Oh, heh. You know, a friend of mine has a watch just like that. I'd love to replace it for him as a gift."
S04E06,LEO,"Well, I haven't seen too many like (indicating watch) these."
S04E06,JERRY,"Yeah, I know. Maybe uh, you wanna sell me that one."
S04E06,LEO,"(sarcastic) Aww, sure. (laughter)"
S04E06,JERRY,(pulling Leo back in) Hang on a second. I got a little proposition for you.
S04E06,DOORMAN,(into phone) There's a George Bonanza to see you.
S04E06,GEORGE,Costanza. Costanza.
S04E06,DOORMAN,(into phone) George Costanza.
S04E06,GEORGE,The guy who pitched him the show with the stories about nothing. (snaps fingers) Jerry Seinfeld. Jerry Seinfeld's friend.
S04E06,DOORMAN,"(into phone) Seinfeld friend. (he listens) (to George) He says, call him Monday."
S04E06,GEORGE,"(into phone, frantic) Mister Dalrimple! Mister Dalrimple I have to talk to you!"
S04E06,DOORMAN,Excuse me.
S04E06,GEORGE,"It's about the show. It... No, it was..."
S04E06,DOORMAN,Excuse me.
S04E06,GEORGE,"...It was all a terrible misunderstanding, sir. Just five minutes. Just five minutes of your time. (listens) Thank you! Thank you, Mister Dalrimple."
S04E06,DOORMAN,"(into phone) Very good, sir."
S04E06,MORTY,"You don't understand. I can't allow my son to pay for me. Look, as soon as I get back to Florida, I promise you I'll mail you a check."
S04E06,MAITRE D',"Why don't you just let him pay, and then you can pay him back?"
S04E06,MORTY,"No, no, he won't let me do that."
S04E06,MAITRE D',"Why don't you just put the money in his pants pocket, unsuspectingly?"
S04E06,MORTY,He could wash them.
S04E06,MAITRE D',"Monsieur, we are running a reputable business."
S04E06,MORTY,Don't tell me about business! I sold raincoats for thirty-five years!
S04E06,MAITRE D',"Aha, but you did not give them away, did you?"
S04E06,MORTY,You don't understand my...
S04E06,MAITRE D',"Ah, monsieur, I cannot get involved with you and your family, ah."
S04E06,ELAINE,"Now look, don't take too long."
S04E06,KRAMER,(looking around) Look at this building. What is this?
S04E06,ELAINE,I don't know. It's a building.
S04E06,KRAMER,(indicating) The door's on a diagonal.
S04E06,ELAINE,So what?
S04E06,KRAMER,(looking around) It's architecturally incorrect.
S04E06,ELAINE,(frustrated) Just go.
S04E06,GEORGE,(sidling in) Is this a bad time? I hope I'm not disturbing anything.
S04E06,RUSSELL,We were about to sit down to dinner.
S04E06,RUSSELL,(indicating) This is Cynthia.
S04E06,GEORGE,"(entering the apartment more fully) Oh. Oh, hi, hi. Hi. Nice to meet you. (peering at the table) What're you having, veal?"
S04E06,RUSSELL,No.
S04E06,GEORGE,Looks like veal.
S04E06,RUSSELL,It's not veal.
S04E06,GEORGE,"Well, it's a good looking piece of meat. (laughs nervously) Wow, this is some place. A duplex, huh? (indicating) Look at this, you got stairs in an apartment. All my life, I dreamed about having steps in an apartment. Even one step. Sunken living room. Although, one step is really not all that sunken. (tries hard to elicit a laugh)"
S04E06,RUSSELL,Who gave you my address?
S04E06,GEORGE,"No, that's a fair question. It is, uhm... (nervous chuckle) Jerry, yeah. (to Cynthia) Jerry's a friend of mine. (to Russell) He uh, he gave it to me. Unbelievable how many addresses of people this guy has."
S04E06,GEORGE,He's got Marlon Brando's. I could go to Marlon Brando's house if I really wanted.
S04E06,GEORGE,"Course, I wouldn't, I mean uh, the guy is uh, well obviously (to Cynthia, as she passes) the guy has his problems."
S04E06,RUSSELL,"So, what's the surprise? You wanna talk about the show?"
S04E06,GEORGE,"Well, you know, it's really very funny, because you know what we got here, really? We really, really, just have a terrible misunderstanding. You see, when I passed on the deal, I thought that's what Jerry wanted me to say. Y'know, I, I misinterpreted."
S04E06,CYNTHIA,"(bored) Russell, where's the TV Guide."
S04E06,GEORGE,"Oh, what time is it? Eight thirty? I'll tell you what's on. You got Major Dad, Blossom, very funny programme..."
S04E06,RUSSELL,Blossom's on Monday.
S04E06,GEORGE,"Are you sure? Oh, look who I'm talking to. The president of NBC. (forced laughter)"
S04E06,RUSSELL,"Look Mister Costanza, it's too late now anyway. I already made a deal with another writing team."
S04E06,GEORGE,"(worried) Alright, alright. Look, we're people, you and me, huh? Businessmen. Colleagues, if I may. Let's not quibble. We'll do it for the thirteen thousand. Thirteen thousand, and I never came up here, we never talked, alright. You take good care. (moving past Russell toward the door) It was nice seeing you again, and nice meeting you. (to Cynthia) Cynthia, right?"
S04E06,RUSSELL,"Alright, now look. These deals are already made."
S04E06,GEORGE,"Awright, lemme just say this. Ten thousand dollars, alright, and now I'm going below what you wanted to pay. You have your dinner, have your veal, or whatever it is. Enjoy..."
S04E06,RUSSELL,Mister Costanza.
S04E06,GEORGE,"Alright, that's it. Alright, good, eight thousand dollars. (to Cynthia) Cynthia, again, nice meeting you. Have I commented on the shoes? I love suede, it's so thick and rich. Did you ever, you ever rub it against the grain? Alright, anyway..."
S04E06,CYNTHIA,"(bored, frustrated) Russell, can we eat?"
S04E06,RUSSELL,(to George) Alright. Eight thousand.
S04E06,GEORGE,(pleased) You've made Jerry very happy.
S04E06,GEORGE,May I just use your bathroom for a moment?
S04E06,JERRY,"Alright, two hundred, but that's as high as I can go. I really think you're being unreasonable here!"
S04E06,LEO,"Jerry, I'd give you the watch. It's not the money, I happen to like it."
S04E06,JERRY,"Look, I happen to know how much that watch cost. It's a sixty dollar watch, you paid forty to get it fixed. That's a hundred dollars. I'm offering you two hundred!"
S04E06,LEO,(indicating) I've never seen a band like this.
S04E06,JERRY,"Aww, right. Three hundred, plus fifty for the repair. Three fifty, that's it!"
S04E06,LEO,You have it on you?
S04E06,JERRY,"Yeah, I think I do."
S04E06,JERRY,(under his breath) This is unbelievable.
S04E06,MORTY,What the hell is going on here?
S04E06,KRAMER,"Well, it uh, (offering his hand) it's a pleasure to meet you."
S04E06,RESTON,(shaking hands) Thank you for coming in.
S04E06,KRAMER,Thank you.
S04E06,RESTON,"Please, sit down."
S04E06,KRAMER,(quiet) Okay.
S04E06,RESTON,"Could I offer you something to drink. Uhm, coffee? Anything?"
S04E06,KRAMER,"Okay uh, yeah. I'll have a uh, you have a decaf cappuccino?"
S04E06,RESTON,I don't think we have that.
S04E06,KRAMER,"Well, that's a little strange."
S04E06,RESTON,"Uh, why does that surprise you?"
S04E06,KRAMER,"Well, it's uh, it's a very popular drink"
S04E06,RESTON,This is an office.
S04E06,KRAMER,"That's true. But, you know, I can't help but think that uh..."
S04E06,RESTON,(interrupting) So tell me Mister Kramer...
S04E06,KRAMER,"...Okay, yes, shoot."
S04E06,RESTON,"Tell me all about uh, you and Elaine."
S04E06,KRAMER,"Oh, alrighty uh..."
S04E06,KRAMER,"Well, what we have here, doctor, is uhm, an extraordinary situation."
S04E06,RESTON,Is it?
S04E06,KRAMER,"Oh, you better believe it."
S04E06,DAVOLA,(singing) '...Travelling along...'
S04E06,ELAINE/DAVOLA,"'...singing a song, side by side...'"
S04E06,ELAINE,Wow. You really have a terrible voice.
S04E06,DAVOLA,Do I know you?
S04E06,ELAINE,"Uhh, I don't think so."
S04E06,DAVOLA,'Cos you really look familiar.
S04E06,ELAINE,"Oh, well maybe you've seen me. My face is on uhm, Mount"
S04E06,DAVOLA,"Oh yes, of course, that's it. I guess I'm just used to seeing it on a much larger scale."
S04E06,ELAINE,"Oh yeah, right. I replaced uh, Teddy Roosevelt."
S04E06,DAVOLA,Oh really.
S04E06,ELAINE,Umm. Trustbuster. Bust this.
S04E06,KRAMER,"You know, I never thought of it like that before, doctor. (points) You, are absolutely right."
S04E06,RESTON,I'm glad we agree.
S04E06,KRAMER,"(reaching in pocket) Hey, would you like a cigar? Y'know, they're Cubans."
S04E06,RESTON,I'd love one.
S04E06,KRAMER,"Yeah. You know, I think Elaine is a wonderful woman. You two are gonna make a wonderful couple."
S04E06,RESTON,"If you ever feel, a need to talk to someone..."
S04E06,KRAMER,(lighting Dr Reston's cigar) Uh huh.
S04E06,RESTON,...About anything. You have my number.
S04E06,KRAMER,"(lighting his own cigar) Well, that's very kind of you."
S04E06,KRAMER,"Mmm, these are good, huh?"
S04E06,KRAMER,(quiet) Oh.
S04E06,ELAINE,"I cannot believe I'm doing this. I never meet people like this. You're not a nut, are you?"
S04E06,DAVOLA,"No, I don't think so."
S04E06,JERRY,I can't believe I'm doing this. I never do stuff like this.
S04E06,NAOMI,(joking) Really? I give out my number to just about every customer who comes in here.
S04E06,JERRY,Oh. (chuckles) Really? You don't seem that desperate.
S04E06,NAOMI,"(playing it straight) Oh yeah. Actually, I'm a little disappointed. I kind of had my eye on uncle Leo."
S04E06,JERRY,"Uh huh. Well uh, I'll give you a call, and thanks for the fish. By the way, you know why fish are so thin?"
S04E06,NAOMI,Why?
S04E06,JERRY,They eat fish.
S04E06,KRAMER,Hey.
S04E06,ELAINE,What happened? What took you so long?
S04E06,KRAMER,"Hey, he's a terrific guy."
S04E06,ELAINE,Wha...? What are you talking about? What'd he say?
S04E06,KRAMER,"Well, we talked about a lot of things."
S04E06,ELAINE (O.C.),You talked about a lot of things? Well...
S04E06,KRAMER (O.C.),Yeah.
S04E06,ELAINE (O.C.),Did you talk about us?
S04E06,DAVOLA (O.C.),I'm in love. I just met her outside in the street. Her
S04E06,RESTON (O.C.),Did you say Elaine?
S04E06,JERRY,"How come the psychiatrist, every, the hour is only fifty minutes? Wha, what do they do with that ten minutes that they have left? Do they just sit there going, ""Boy, that guy was crazy. I couldn't believe the things he was saying. What a nut! Who's coming in next? Oh, no, another headcase!"""
S04E06,MORTY,You shoulda told me it didn't work.
S04E06,JERRY,"I know, I know."
S04E06,HELEN,You didn't have to throw it out.
S04E06,JERRY,"I was always late. It was frustrating me. I'm sorry, I really am."
S04E06,HELEN,"Oh, that must be Leo."
S04E06,JERRY,I woulda taken you to the airport.
S04E06,HELEN,He has nothing to do.
S04E06,JERRY,Neither do I. (to intercom) Yeah?
S04E06,GEORGE (O.S.),It's George.
S04E06,JERRY,Come on up. (to parents) It's George.
S04E06,MORTY,"Oh, it's George."
S04E06,HELEN,What ever happened with NBC and the deal?
S04E06,JERRY,"Ah, George turned it down."
S04E06,HELEN,He turned it down?
S04E06,JERRY,Yeah.
S04E06,HELEN,Why did he do that?
S04E06,JERRY,Because of Ted Danson.
S04E06,HELEN,What does Ted Danson have to do with it?
S04E06,MORTY,Maybe he doesn't like Ted Danson.
S04E06,JERRY,"(fetching a drink from the fridge) Hey, who knows, maybe we'll wind up getting more money."
S04E06,GEORGE,(to Jerry) Hey.
S04E06,MORTY,"Hey, Georgie-boy, how are ya?"
S04E06,GEORGE,"Hey, Mr Seinfeld. (shakes Morty's hand) Hey, Mrs Seinfeld. How are you?"
S04E06,HELEN,What's the matter with you?
S04E06,GEORGE,What'd I do?
S04E06,JERRY,What about NBC? Did you hear anything?
S04E06,GEORGE,"Yeah, as a matter of fact, I did."
S04E06,GEORGE,We got a deal.
S04E06,MORTY/HELEN/JERRY,(simultaneous) Hey!/That's wonderful!/We got a deal!
S04E06,JERRY,Heyy! Terrific.
S04E06,MORTY,"You see, he had the right idea. Hold out. That's how you get the big money, huh George? (slaps George on the shoulder)"
S04E06,GEORGE,"Uh, please, Morty."
S04E06,MORTY,"No, no, no. He knows how to talk to these people. No-one's gonna take advantage of Georgie. (slaps George's shoulder again)"
S04E06,GEORGE,I'm just happy to be working with your talented son...
S04E06,JERRY,Aww...
S04E06,GEORGE,...Who's not doing this for the money.
S04E06,JERRY,...C'mon.
S04E06,GEORGE,You have no idea how refreshing that is.
S04E06,JERRY,So what'd we get?
S04E06,GEORGE,(big smile) Eight thousand dollars.
S04E06,JERRY,Beautiful!
S04E06,GEORGE,"(quietly) That's uh, for the two of us."
S04E06,HELEN,Four thousand apiece?
S04E06,JERRY,"Lemme see if I understand this. In other words, you held out"
S04E06,GEORGE,"I was wrong, you were right."
S04E06,JERRY,"You know, the basic idea of negotiation, as I understand it, is to get your price to go... up."
S04E06,GEORGE,"You're smart, I'm dumb."
S04E06,JERRY,"You know, this is how they negotiate in the bizarro world."
S04E06,HELEN,That's gotta be Leo.
S04E06,JERRY,(to intercom) Yeah?
S04E06,LEO (O.C.),Leo.
S04E06,JERRY,"Alright, we're coming down."
S04E06,MORTY,"Alright, let's get going."
S04E06,JERRY,"Dad, before we go, I got a little something for you."
S04E06,JERRY,A present.
S04E06,MORTY,A present?
S04E06,MORTY,"Hey! Look at this, a wallet. Exactly what I needed, y'see."
S04E06,JERRY,"C'mon, you lost your wallet, I figured I'd get you another one."
S04E06,HELEN,I hope you didn't spend too much on that.
S04E06,MORTY,I wanna tell you. This is one of the most thoughtful gifts anyone's ever given me.
S04E06,HELEN,"He's something, you son, isn't he?"
S04E06,JERRY,"Ah hah, alright, let's go."
S04E06,MORTY,You're a terrific kid.
S04E06,JERRY,Okay.
S04E06,GEORGE,"Yeah, he's something, isn't he?"
S04E06,HELEN,How could anybody not like you?
S04E06,GEORGE,(to Jerry) You're very special.
S04E06,JERRY,"(pointedly) Yeah, I'm good for about four thousand dollars."
S04E06,LEO,"Hey, let's go! It's twelve (checks watch) uh, twelve twenty-two."
S04E06,MORTY,"Alright, Leo."
S04E06,JERRY,"Hey, uncle Leo."
S04E06,LEO,"Hi, hi..."
S04E06,JERRY,How you doing?
S04E06,JERRY,This is some beautiful parking spot you got here.
S04E06,LEO,"Yeah, I hate to give it up."
S04E06,JERRY,"Yeah. Hey, dad, you sure you don't need any more money?"
S04E06,MORTY,Jerry!
S04E06,JERRY,"Alright, I'm just joking. Listen, have a nice trip."
S04E06,HELEN,"(hugging Jerry) Bye bye, Jerry."
S04E06,GEORGE,"Bye Mrs Seinfeld, take care."
S04E06,MORTY,Bye bye. (hugging Jerry) Thanks again for the wallet.
S04E06,GEORGE,"(shaking hands with Morty) Morty, always a pleasure."
S04E06,JERRY,Take care now. So long.
S04E06,GEORGE,"Yeah, like he was really gonna take your money."
S04E06,JERRY,"Oh, he took it. I put four hundred dollars in the new wallet."
S04E06,GEORGE,You're kidding.
S04E06,JERRY,"He lost all that cash. It was the only way I could give it back to him, otherwise he wouldn't accept it."
S04E06,GEORGE,"Man, would I like to see the look on his face."
S04E06,MORTY,You believe this?
S04E06,HELEN,What?
S04E06,MORTY,(indicates the new wallet) It's velcro.
S04E06,HELEN,You're kidding.
S04E06,MORTY,Who needs this?
S04E06,MORTY,"Leo, let's go."
S04E06,JERRY,"...main difference between the women's wallet and the man's wallet, is the photo section. True? Women carry with them a photograph of every person they've ever met, every day in their whole lives, since the beginning of time. And every picture is out of date. You know what I mean? It's, ""Here's my cousin, three years old. She's in the marines now."" ""This is my dog. He died during the Johnson administration."" You know. You get stopped by a cop, no licence, no registration, (waves imaginary wallet) ""Here's fifty-six people that know me."" Cop goes. ""Alright, ma'am, just wanted to make sure you had some friends, move it along. Routine pal check."""
S04E07,JERRY,"Have you ever called someone up, and you're disappointed when they answer the phone? You wanted the machine. You know, and you're always kind of thrown off, (left hand up to side of face, pretending its a receiver) you go ""Oh, I eh, I - I didn't know you were there, I ah - just wanted to leave a message saying, sorry I missed you."""
S04E07,JERRY,Well this is it.
S04E07,NAOMI,"Oh, this is nice. Thanks again for the Chinese food."
S04E07,JERRY,"Oh, you're welcome. You know I think I ate too much of that garlic."
S04E07,NAOMI,"Yeah, me too."
S04E07,JERRY,"No, I ate the whole plate. I didn't know those little things were garlic. I thought they were peanuts."
S04E07,NAOMI,"(laughs) - Nnnhhahahahahahahahahahahahahaha (obnoxious laugh). Oh, you know what? I think Naked Gun is on. Oh I've seen it. I laughed through that whole thing. You wanna watch?"
S04E07,JERRY,"No, I mean, I don't think so."
S04E07,NAOMI,I thought you liked to laugh. I thought you were happy go lucky.
S04E07,JERRY,"No, no, no. I'm not happy, I'm not lucky, and I don't go. If anything I'm sad stop unlucky."
S04E07,NAOMI,Ahahahahahahahahaha.
S04E07,JERRY,That's not funny Naomi.
S04E07,NAOMI,Ah hahahaha. (points at Jerry)
S04E07,JERRY,"I didn't mean to be funny there. Why don't you check the TV guide. I think uh, Holocaust is on."
S04E07,GEORGE,"(on the answering machine) Jerry, it's George. Hey, hey are you all set for the weekend. This is going to be great. You're going to have a great time with Naomi."
S04E07,GEORGE,"(con't) All right, you know she's got that laugh. What did you say? It's like Elmer Fudd sitting on a juicer?"
S04E07,GEORGE,"(con't) A-Anyway, I was thinking we would take two cars up to the cabin and that way if one of wanted to stay you know..."
S04E07,JERRY,This thing has never worked right. (holding the machine in his hand)
S04E07,NAOMI,"You think I, laugh like Elmer Fudd sitting on a juicer?"
S04E07,JERRY,"Well, first of all Elmer Fudd is one of the most beloved internationally known cartoon characters of all time. ""I'm going to kill that cwazy wabbit ... hahahahahaaa "" Come on. Not only that, a juicer is one of the healthiest ways ... (Naomi exits) it makes the juice ... it extracts the-the pulp and-and-and the vitamins, for-for long life and-and-and vitality."
S04E07,JERRY,How could you leave a message like that on my machine.?
S04E07,GEORGE,Well how could you just play your message in front of anybody?
S04E07,JERRY,Because I didn't think anyone would leave it!
S04E07,GEORGE,"Well, I didn't think anyone would play it."
S04E07,JERRY,"Well, now she's not going away for this weekend."
S04E07,GEORGE,"What do you mean not goin'? Come on, we got plans here. Call her up."
S04E07,JERRY,"Nah, it's better anyway. I mean really. What was going to happen? I'm a comedian. How can I go out with a girl with a laugh like that? I mean izz-it's like ah, it's like Coco Chanel goin' out with a fish monger. You know, cause she's with all the perfumes and a fish monger's pretty bad smell."
S04E07,GEORGE,Wh-Well maybe you should ask Elaine.
S04E07,JERRY,"Yeah but if I ask Elaine, then Kramer will feel slighted."
S04E07,GEORGE,"Oh no no no no, don't say anything to Kramer. Susan can't stand him. He vomited all over her."
S04E07,JERRY,"Yeah, .. wait a minute do you smell smoke?"
S04E07,KRAMER,Hmm.
S04E07,JERRY,"Ah, Kramer."
S04E07,KRAMER,"Hello boys, (in an Irish accent) top of the morning to ya. What do you say?"
S04E07,JERRY,Will you put that thing out before you start another fire. You had to give him a box of cigars.
S04E07,KRAMER,"So, what are you guys doin' this weekend?"
S04E07,JERRY and GEORGE,"uh uh, we're uh .."
S04E07,KRAMER,Because I'm going to be playing golf at the Westchester country club. Mmh.
S04E07,JERRY,Westchester? Isn't that a private club?
S04E07,KRAMER,"Oh, that's right buddy. It's private. It's very private. But I met the pro at the golf shop up on 49th St. -- I gave him one of these Cubans and he invites me up to play a free round ... then he says anytime I lay one of these babies on him it's going to be the same deal. Ha ha. Idn't that beautiful."
S04E07,JERRY,"and GEORGE Ye, hu, um Ye,"
S04E07,KRAMER,"Man, I'm going to be hitting the links all weekend. Ffoooo (Taking an imaginary swing, he makes the sound of a golf ball being hit)"
S04E07,GEORGE,"Gee, that's-that's too bad."
S04E07,JERRY,"Yeah, too bad."
S04E07,KRAMER,Why? What wa?
S04E07,GEORGE,"Well, cause we were just saying we were going to ask you to come up to the country with us this weekend. Susan's father has a cabin up there. But, eh, all right, well."
S04E07,KRAMER,"Well, what, they got any golf courses up there?"
S04E07,JERRY and GEORGE,"No, no, no, no, no, no, no."
S04E07,GEORGE,"No, no that's ah, that's pie country."
S04E07,JERRY,Yeah
S04E07,GEORGE,"Yeah, they eh, they do a lot of baking up there."
S04E07,KRAMER,Uh huh.
S04E07,JERRY,"They sell them by the side of the road. Blueberry, Blackberry ...."
S04E07,GEORGE,"Blackberry, Boysenberry ..."
S04E07,JERRY,"Boysenberry, Huckleberry ..."
S04E07,GEORGE,"Huckleberry, Raspberry..."
S04E07,JERRY,"Raspberry, Strawberry ..."
S04E07,GEORGE,"Strawberry, Cranberry ..."
S04E07,JERRY,Peach.
S04E07,ELAINE,I don't know.
S04E07,JERRY,Come on. I don't want to tag along with George and Susan. If you're there it'll be a better group.
S04E07,ELAINE,What's that?
S04E07,JERRY,"Ah, it's an autographed picture for my dry cleaner. I never know what to write on these things. I hate doin' this."
S04E07,ELAINE,"""I'm very imPRESSED""? ... Ah you mean pressed caus' its like a dry cleaner?"
S04E07,JERRY,"Yeah, see that's why I hate it. So, come on, you going to go?"
S04E07,ELAINE,Well what about the sleeping arrangements? In the Cabin!
S04E07,JERRY,"Well, um same bed ..."
S04E07,ELAINE,uh huh (very quietly)
S04E07,JERRY,".. and uh, underwear and a tee shirt."
S04E07,ELAINE,What about me?
S04E07,JERRY,Well you'd be naked of course.
S04E07,ELAINE,"Uh, that's, ..."
S04E07,MEL,"Excuse me, Jerry Seinfeld?"
S04E07,JERRY,Yeah.
S04E07,MEL,"My name's Sanger, Mel Sanger."
S04E07,JERRY,Hi.
S04E07,MEL,I drive that truck out there.
S04E07,JERRY,"Oh, the Yoo Hoo?"
S04E07,MEL,Yeah.
S04E07,JERRY,I love Yoo Hoo.
S04E07,MEL,"Yes, it's a fine product. Anyway I saw you on the Tonight Show a couple weeks ago. I was watching the show with my son Donald. He's got this rare immune deficiency in his blood ... the damnedest thing. Doctors say he has to live in a plastic bubble. Can you imagine that? A bubble."
S04E07,JERRY,A bubble?
S04E07,ELAINE,A bubble?
S04E07,MEL,"Yes, a bubble!"
S04E07,MEL,Do you mind? May I?
S04E07,ELAINE,"Oh, sure."
S04E07,MEL,"Ah, It'd break your heart seein' him in there. It's like a prisoner. No friends - just his mother and me. And I'm out there six days a week haulin' Yoo Hoo. We have sacrificed everything. All for the sake of our little ... bubble boy."
S04E07,MEL,"(in tears) Excuse me, I ah ..."
S04E07,ELAINE,Oh right here (giving out paper napkins to Mel and Jerry and herself)
S04E07,MEL,"Excuse me, anyway we were watching ya on TV."
S04E07,JERRY,You get in the bubble with him?
S04E07,MEL,No. He can see through the bubble. It's plastic.
S04E07,JERRY,"Oh, I thought it was like an igloo."
S04E07,MEL,"No, it's clear."
S04E07,JERRY,Ah ha.
S04E07,ELAINE,Who has the remote? (wipes a tear from her eye)
S04E07,MEL,He does.
S04E07,ELAINE,The remote goes through the bubble?
S04E07,MEL,"Yeah, he's in the bubble with the remote."
S04E07,JERRY,So you have no control over the remote?
S04E07,MEL,"No, it's frustrating."
S04E07,JERRY,Mmm
S04E07,ELAINE,"Yeah, of course, yeah. (blows her nose)"
S04E07,MEL,"So anyway, you're his favorite comedian. He laughed so hard the other night we had to give him an extra shot of hemoglobin."
S04E07,JERRY,Awe... That's nice!
S04E07,MEL,"Tomorrow is his birthday and it would mean so much to him if you could find it in your heart ta' pay him a visit and, just say hello."
S04E07,JERRY,"Hu, well, tomorrow, I, ..."
S04E07,ELAINE,Jerry! Of course he'd pay him a visit. You'd be happy to.
S04E07,JERRY,"Yeah, uh, Ok, uh, tomorrow uh, where da ya - where do you live, uh, up town? Upper west side?"
S04E07,MEL,"No, up state."
S04E07,JERRY,Up state! Hummm.
S04E07,JERRY,He's a bubble boy.
S04E07,GEORGE,A bubble boy?
S04E07,JERRY,Yes. A bubble boy.
S04E07,SUSAN,What's a bubble boy?
S04E07,JERRY,He lives in a bubble.
S04E07,GEORGE,Boy!
S04E07,SUSAN,"Say, so what kind of a bubble? Like an igloo?"
S04E07,JERRY,"No, that's what I thought but apparently it's just a big piece of plastic dividing the room."
S04E07,SUSAN,Oh.
S04E07,GEORGE,What kind of plastic do you think it is? What do you think like that dry cleaning plastic?
S04E07,JERRY,"That's no good. He wouldn't last ten minutes in there. Anyway what can I do, I promised I'd go visit him tomorrow. It's his birthday. I can't go to the cabin."
S04E07,SUSAN,"Well, where does he live?"
S04E07,JERRY,"I don't know, up state, Falls, somethin'"
S04E07,SUSAN,"Wait a minute, This is right on the way to the cabin."
S04E07,GEORGE,"Well all right, beautiful, so you stop in. Ya, ya visit the bubble boy for twenty minutes and then we can go."
S04E07,JERRY,You think we can do it?
S04E07,SUSAN,Oh I know exactly where this is. You can just follow us.
S04E07,JERRY,"Oh, great. Ok we'll goin' away. I think I'm excited."
S04E07,GEORGE,(laughs) hu hu.
S04E07,SUSAN,"I'm excited. Oh, you're going to love this cabin. My grandfather built it in 1947. It's it's incredible."
S04E07,JERRY,Ohh.
S04E07,GEORGE,"All right there you go. It's a '47 cabin all right. So, we'll see you tomorrow."
S04E07,JERRY,OK.
S04E07,KRAMER,"Well,"
S04E07,GEORGE,"and JERRY Very nice, very nice, nice."
S04E07,KRAMER,"Well, I'm off to the links."
S04E07,GEORGE,and JERRY Yeah.
S04E07,KRAMER,"Listen, I want to thank you for the invite up state. I'm sorry I can't make it."
S04E07,GEORGE,(clears his throat)
S04E07,SUSAN,The what?
S04E07,GEORGE,"Uh, nothing, lets get going. Come on. (laughs) hu hu."
S04E07,SUSAN,Did you ... (George grabs her hand)
S04E07,GEORGE,"No, no, no we'll talk about it later."
S04E07,SUSAN,Is that one of the cigars my father gave you? (Susan is pulled from the apt. and Kramer looks out the door to watch them leave)
S04E07,ELAINE,"Hey, what's with George and Susan? Does he actually like her?"
S04E07,JERRY,"Ah, I don't know if he likes her as much as he likes it.?"
S04E07,ELAINE,"Oh, that's nice!"
S04E07,JERRY,What's he doing? What is his hurry?
S04E07,ELAINE,Well you know George. It's not good enough to get there. You gotta make good time.
S04E07,JERRY,I know he once went from West 81st Street to Kennedy Airport in 25 minutes.
S04E07,ELAINE,Hmhmhm (laughing quietly)
S04E07,JERRY,Look at him.
S04E07,ELAINE,Hmhmhm (laughing quietly)
S04E07,GEORGE,Would you stop that please. Would you just stop that?
S04E07,SUSAN,Why?
S04E07,GEORGE,"Knock it off, just sit in your seat over there you're distracting me. We're making incredible time here. I once went into Kennedy Airport from West 81st Street to in uh, in 15 minutes. hu uh. Oh, here hold this. It's uh, ten dollars for the tolls."
S04E07,JERRY,What's he doing? Is he out of his mind? Do you see him? I don't even think I see him anymore. Where is he?
S04E07,ELAINE,Isn't that blue car him?
S04E07,JERRY,"No, no that's not him. What happened to him? I can't believe it. I lost him. That stupid idiot. Now what are we going to do?"
S04E07,ELAINE,It's no big deal Jerry. We'll just meet him at the bubble boy's house.
S04E07,JERRY,I don't even know where the bubble boy lives. I - I don't even remember the name of the town.
S04E07,ELAINE,"Wa',you don't have the directions?"
S04E07,JERRY,"No, I was following him."
S04E07,ELAINE,How could you not take the directions?
S04E07,JERRY,"Because, HE'S my directions."
S04E07,SUSAN,I didn't see them George.
S04E07,JERRY,We make all these plans - this idiot goes a hundred miles an hour - the whole weekend's over - incredible - just like that -
S04E07,ELAINE,"Poor little bubble boy. He's sitting there waiting for you in his bubble, or igloo thing, whatever."
S04E07,JERRY,I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO DO. I DON'T KNOW WHERE I AM.
S04E07,ELAINE,Here just get off at this exit. We'll figure somethin' out.
S04E07,SUSAN,We lost them. Do you KNOW THAT. WE LOST THEM!
S04E07,GEORGE,Well it's not my fault. Seinfeld can't drive. How hard is it to follow somebody?
S04E07,SUSAN,Well now what are you gonna do?
S04E07,GEORGE,"It's fine, we'll just meet him at the bubble boy's house."
S04E07,SUSAN,Does he have the address?
S04E07,JERRY,(answering machine) Leave a message. I'll call you back. Thanks.
S04E07,NAOMI,"(on phone speaker) Hi, Jerry it's Naomi. Ah, listen, if its not too late I, changed my mind, I'd like to go to the cabin."
S04E07,KRAMER,"Wait, wai, ... ... Yeah. Hello!, Hi, Aw, this is Kramer. Yeah, I'm the next door neighbor. Aw, well you know, ah Jerry's left, uh, uh, But listen, ah, see ah, my golf game got canceled. Uh, I'm thinkin' of going up myself... They got pies and ah, I got the directions right here."
S04E07,KRAMER,So then I drive all the way up to the country club and then I find out they got a tournament goin' on. Do you mind if I smoke?
S04E07,NAOMI,No.
S04E07,KRAMER,"These are Cubans. (IN FAKE SPANISH) Maria, poquendo los scientos de estes con gleam."
S04E07,NAOMI,Ha ha ha ha ha ha ... Ha ha ha ha ha ha ... Ha haaaa
S04E07,GEORGE,I don't know of this is the house. I don't see Jerry's car anywhere.
S04E07,GEORGE,Would you stop it. (Susan playfully bites his ear lobe again) Would you quit it please. Someone is going to see us here.
S04E07,SUSAN,So what? You are SUCH a prude.
S04E07,GEORGE,"Hey, I am not a prude sweetheart. I swing with the best of them. (snapping his fingers 5 times)"
S04E07,SUSAN,"Okay, Come on lets go in."
S04E07,GEORGE,What?
S04E07,SUSAN,Well we should at least tell them what happened. They might be very late if they make it at all.
S04E07,GEORGE,I can't go in there. I can't face the bubble boy.
S04E07,SUSAN,What's the matter?
S04E07,GEORGE,I-I just don't react well to these situations. My grandmother died two months early because of the way I reacted in the hospital. She was getting' better. And then I went to pay her a visit. She saw my face. BOOM. That was the end of it.
S04E07,SUSAN,"Okay, we're goin' in. Come on."
S04E07,GEORGE,"Susan, wait please... (grabs her) Please ..."
S04E07,SUSAN,Come on George. George stop. George.
S04E07,GEORGE,"Susan, Susan would you wai,...."
S04E07,JERRY,"(ranting) I can't believe how a little thing like George going too fast - and my whole weekend is gone - the plans, the packing, ... everything."
S04E07,ELAINE,Your whole weekend? What about the bubble boy?
S04E07,JERRY,Why do you keep bringing up the bubble boy. You don't have to mention the bubble boy? I know about the bubble boy. I'm aware of the bubble boy. Why do you keep reminding me about the bubble boy?
S04E07,JERRY,I'll have a cup of coffee and a turkey club.
S04E07,WAITRESS,How ?bout you?
S04E07,ELAINE,"Um, I'll just have a glass of water."
S04E07,JERRY,(whispers) You can't just have water.
S04E07,ELAINE,Why not? That's all I want.
S04E07,JERRY,Well this is not like a park bench where you just come in and sit down. It's a business.
S04E07,WAITRESS,Hold it a second. Don't ?chu play on TV?
S04E07,JERRY,"Oh, no."
S04E07,ELAINE,YES! yes. You saw him on TV.

S04E07,JERRY,"Uh, I don't have anymore pictures Elaine."
S04E07,ELAINE,He's lying. They're in the trunk (takes car keys) Now you get to sign another one.
S04E07,JERRY,I'm not lying.
S04E07,ELAINE,"Yeah, yeah he is. (as she leaves)"
S04E07,JERRY,She'll have a cup of coffee and a broiled chicken.
S04E07,MRS. SANGER,See it's not really a bubble. A lot of people think it's an igloo. But it's really just a plastic divider.
S04E07,GEORGE,Huh (quietly)
S04E07,GEORGE,and SUSAN (nod)
S04E07,GEORGE,"Can you uh, go in the bubble?"
S04E07,MRS. SANGER,"Well, you have to put so many things on because of the germs."
S04E07,MEL,"The gloves, the mask, it's a whole production."
S04E07,GEORGE,So then he makes his own bed?
S04E07,MRS. SANGER,"Well, that's one of the things we fight about."
S04E07,MEL,Would you like to meet him?
S04E07,GEORGE,"Uh, well, you know,..."
S04E07,MRS. SANGER,"Oh, he loves games. Maybe you could play Trivial Pursuit with him."
S04E07,DONALD,"HEY MA WHAT THE HELL DO I GOT TO DO TO GET SOME FOOD AROUND HERE? I'M STARVIN'. AND IF IT'S PEANUT BUTTER, I'M GONNA SHOVE IT IN YOUR FACE."
S04E07,MRS. SANGER,"(embarrassed) Ha...ha ha ha ha, ha."
S04E07,ELAINE,(laughing) hehehe -- One picture left in the trunk.
S04E07,JERRY,"Uh, THANKS! This is FUN! Yeah, this turned out to be a GREAT weekend."
S04E07,ELAINE,Where's my water?
S04E07,JERRY,"Oh, it's comin'. - Here ya' go."
S04E07,WAITRESS,Thanks.

S04E07,JERRY,No good?
S04E07,ELAINE,THIS is what you came up with?
S04E07,JERRY,Well.
S04E07,ELAINE,"That is so lame. Jerry, people are going to be reading that for the next twenty years and laughing at you."
S04E07,JERRY,"Yeah, yeah, you're right. Excuse me, excuse me. Would you mind. I'd like to take the picture back."
S04E07,WAITRESS,Why
S04E07,JERRY,"I, I'm not happy with what I wrote."
S04E07,WAITRESS,It's good. I like it.
S04E07,JERRY,"No, believe me it's not good. I'll mail you a new one with something really funny written on it."
S04E07,WAITRESS,"Well, when you mail me a new one I'll send you back this one."
S04E07,JERRY,"No, look, you don't understand. I, I want the picture."
S04E07,WAITRESS,RIGHT! (leaves)
S04E07,MRS. SANGER,This is Donald.
S04E07,GEORGE,Hi. (waves to Donald and laughs) hahahaha.
S04E07,SUSAN,Hello.

S04E07,GEORGE,"A-hu no, uh, it's just that ..."
S04E07,DONALD,WELL I'M GOING TO KICK YOUR ASS.
S04E07,JERRY,"Look, I was nice enough to give you the picture. I don't like what I wrote. I don't want it up there. Now please just give it back to me."
S04E07,WAITRESS,You are really startin' to get under my skin.
S04E07,JERRY,I want that picture.
S04E07,WAITRESS,"Well, you can't have it! In fact maybe you better just pay your check and get out."
S04E07,JERRY,I'm not paying for anything until I get that back.
S04E07,WAITRESS,"Well, you ain't getting' it back."
S04E07,JERRY,"Well, maybe I'll just take it back."
S04E07,ELAINE,This chicken is really good.
S04E07,DONALD,"OK, HISTORY ... THIS IS FOR THE GAME. ... HOW YA DOIN' OVER THERE? ... NOT TOO GOOD!"
S04E07,GEORGE,All right Bubble Boy. Let's just play... Who invaded Spain in the 8th century?
S04E07,DONALD,THAT'S A JOKE. THE MOORS.
S04E07,GEORGE,"Oh, Noooo, I'm so sorry. It's the MOOPS. The correct answer is, The MOOPS."
S04E07,DONALD,"MOOPS? LET ME SEE THAT. THAT'S NOT MOOPS YOU JERK, IT'S MOORS. IT'S A MISPRINT."
S04E07,GEORGE,I'm sorry the card says MOOPS.

S04E07,GEORGE,What? Must be a big one.
S04E07,ELAINE,Do you smell something?
S04E07,JERRY,"Yeah,"
S04E07,SUSAN,Smoke.
S04E07,GEORGE,"Yeah, (cough) Definite smoke."
S04E07,ELAINE,"Arghhh, look it's a fire! (cough)"
S04E07,JERRY,Holy cow! look at that!
S04E07,SUSAN,IT'S MY FATHER'S CABIN!
S04E07,ELAINE,The CABIN is on fire!
S04E07,GEORGE,(Apprehensively) Um. I just realized. Ya' never gave me back the change from the tolls.
S04E07,ELAINE,How could this have happened?
S04E07,KRAMER,"(singing) ... It's a big, wild, funky mountain man ..."
S04E07,NAOMI,"Oh, my god, the cabin?"
S04E07,JERRY,What are you two doin' here?
S04E07,NAOMI,Look at that.
S04E07,JERRY,You didn't ... (makes motion like he's lighting a cigar)
S04E07,KRAMER,My Cubans! (runs off to the burning cabin)
S04E07,** Pies - Just in case you did not know what these two kinds of pies are,
S04E07,Boysenberry,"The edible fruit obtained by crossing the blackberry, raspberry, and loganberry. [ After Rudolph Boysen, 20th century U.S. horticulturist ]"
S04E07,Huckleberry,The edible black or dark blue berry of any of various North American shrubs. 2. A shrub yielding this berry.
S04E08,[Setting,Jerry's apartment]
S04E08,JERRY,She hasn't told her father yet?
S04E08,GEORGE,No. We're supposed to tell him tonight.
S04E08,JERRY,"""We're""? What do you mean, ""We're""?"
S04E08,GEORGE,Susan wants me to be there.
S04E08,JERRY,You're meetin' the father for the first time?
S04E08,GEORGE,(Reluctantly) Yeah.
S04E08,JERRY,"(Chuckles slightly) Well, you'll make quite an impression on him when you tell him how you burned his cabin down."
S04E08,GEORGE,I didn't burn it down - Kramer did!
S04E08,JERRY,"(Laughs) I mean, the whole thing is ironic. Think of it Here the guy is nice enough to give you a box of very fine Cuban cigars.."
S04E08,GEORGE,"Yeah, I know what happened."
S04E08,JERRY,"No, but wait, wait And then you dump them off onto Kramer.."
S04E08,GEORGE,(Getting frustrated) I know.
S04E08,JERRY,"(Continuing) ..Who, who proceeds to burn the man's cabin down with one of those very same cigars! (Topping off his observation) It's very comical.."
S04E08,GEORGE,"Listen, maybe we shouldn't start writing today. I got a lot on my mind."
S04E08,JERRY,"(Persisting) No, no, we put this off long enough. Today's the day."
S04E08,GEORGE,"(Letting his conscious get the best of him) I wonder how Susan's father's going to react to this. Alright, what- what's the worst he could do? So you burn a cabin down.."
S04E08,JERRY,"(Agreeing) C'mon. It's not even a house - it's, like, a cabin."
S04E08,GEORGE,We could build a cabin like (Snaps) that.
S04E08,JERRY,"(Blunt) Well, maybe not us, but two men could."
S04E08,GEORGE,"(Looking over the writing materials they just bought) Bics? What, d'ja get, bics?"
S04E08,JERRY,"What, you got a problem with the pen now?"
S04E08,GEORGE,"Well, I like a rolling writer. They're very smooth."
S04E08,JERRY,"Alright, let's just get to work. (They both move into the living room - ready to start writing their script. Jerry sits down) NBC Pilot, Seinfeld project. Act I, Scene A."
S04E08,GEORGE,"(Still standing) So, you're gonna sit there?"
S04E08,JERRY,"(Wanting to get started) Just - just park yourself. (George reluctantly sits on the sofa) Alright. Act I, Scene A."
S04E08,GEORGE,(Offering) Drink?
S04E08,JERRY,"No, no thank you."
S04E08,GEORGE,"(Uncapping his pen) Alright, here we go."
S04E08,JERRY,"Act I, Scene A.."
S04E08,GEORGE,Weren't you supposed to call Elaine?
S04E08,JERRY,"(Eagerly reaching for the phone) Yes. (George turns the TV on, and begins watching as Jerry dials the number) Hi, is Elaine there? Oh, uh, Hi, Sandra. Uh, yeah. I can hold. (To George) Every time I call I gotta chit-chat with her assistant for, like, twenty minutes. (Back into the phone) Oh, hi, Sandra. Listen, I'm at a pay phone, and there's lots of people here waiting to use it. (Yelling out for believability) I'll be off in a minute! (To Sandra) Yeah, could you just put me through to Elaine? Okay, thanks! (He turns to George) Are you thinking of ideas? (George, picking his teeth with his finger, is absorbed into the television. He seems to not even notice Jerry) Listen, Elaine, is there any way I could get through to you directly? Every time I call Sandra bends my ear for, like, twenty minutes. (Pause) So we're on for later?"
S04E08,ELAINE,"Yeah, I'll come by after work. Hey, I got a rubber pencil thing happenin' here.. (Sandra passes her doorway) Uh, I gotta go. I gotta go. (Hangs up) Sandra! Sandra? Hi, can you come here for a second?"
S04E08,JERRY,"Okay, let's go. (George shuts the television off, ready to work)"
S04E08,GEORGE,"Alright, here we go. You got it?"
S04E08,JERRY,Yeah.
S04E08,GEORGE,Here we go.
S04E08,JERRY,"Okay, how about this I'm in my apartment, you come in."
S04E08,GEORGE,"(Holding out his arms - giving praise) It's beautiful. Now, what do I say?"
S04E08,ELAINE,"Could you do me a favor? Um, when my friends call, could you not talk to them for too long?"
S04E08,SANDRA,Why? Did Jerry say something?
S04E08,ELAINE,"No, no."
S04E08,SANDRA,He must have said something.
S04E08,ELAINE,"Oh, no, he didn't say anything."
S04E08,SANDRA,(Near tears) I can't work for you! I can't. I'm leaving. (Exits quickly)
S04E08,ELAINE,"(Calling out to Sandra) No, Sandra. I'm sorry, I'm sorry! I really am! Listen, listen, Jerry's under a lot of pressure right now. It's very hard being a stand-up comedian! Sometimes they don't laugh!"
S04E08,GEORGE,"Alright, let's go."
S04E08,JERRY,Here we go.
S04E08,KRAMER,Hey.
S04E08,GEORGE,"yeah, Kramer, we're, uh, kind of in the middle of something here. We're trying to do a little work.."
S04E08,JERRY,"Yeah, come on. (Kramer gives out a frustrated sigh) What's with you?"
S04E08,KRAMER,(Complaining) No more golf.
S04E08,JERRY,Why?
S04E08,KRAMER,"Well, you remember I told you about the pro, you know, at the Westchester Country Club, who's letting me play a round every time I give him a couple of those Cuban cigars?"
S04E08,JERRY,Yeah.
S04E08,KRAMER,"(Angered) Yeah, well, I lost them all in the fire! (Leaning over the couch, he addresses George) Hey, George, maybe you can ask Susan's father for more, huh?"
S04E08,GEORGE,"What are you, Crazy? I can't ask the guy for more cigars after you burned down his cabin!"
S04E08,KRAMER,Why? What's one thing got to do with another?
S04E08,GEORGE,"Kramer, please."
S04E08,KRAMER,"Well, I can't go back to the public courses, now. I can't! I won't. I mean, you know what that's like? It's crowded, the grass has big brown patches in it, they don't rake the sand traps! Not to mention the caliber of people you have to play with!"
S04E08,GEORGE,"Kramer, I can't help you. You're gonna have to get them some place else."
S04E08,KRAMER,(Opening the door) Where? They're Cubans. (Leaves)
S04E08,GEORGE,(Getting up) You know what? Maybe I should take off.
S04E08,JERRY,What?!
S04E08,GEORGE,"Well, you know, I gotta go to, uh, Susan's parent's house for dinner.. and, you know, I want to shower first.. and I want to leave myself plenty of time."
S04E08,JERRY,(Looking at his watch) You got four hours! What about the script?
S04E08,GEORGE,I think we got a bite on it. (Exits)
S04E08,[Setting,The Ross' house]
S04E08,MRS. ROSS,"(To Mr. Ross) Doesn't George look like your sister, Sarah?"
S04E08,MR. ROSS,(Gruff) A slight resemblance.
S04E08,MRS. ROSS,"(To George) Her son's a podiatrist, you know."
S04E08,GEORGE,"Ohh, I have tremendous respect for people who work with feet. I mean, to dedicate yourself to the foot - you're toiling in virtual anonymity. I mean.."
S04E08,MR. ROSS,How are you enjoying those cigars I gave you?
S04E08,GEORGE,"Oh, uh, the cigars.. (Chuckles nervously) I'm, uh, suckin' 'em down. I'm puffing my brains out, yeah."
S04E08,MR. ROSS,You know those cigars are made special for Castro?
S04E08,GEORGE,(Impersonating Carson) I didn't not know that. Weird. Wild. (Susan and George both laugh)
S04E08,MR. ROSS,What?
S04E08,SUSAN,"(Explaining) He's doing Johnny Carson, daddy."
S04E08,MR. ROSS,I didn't care much for his jokes.
S04E08,SUSAN,(To George) Daddy never laughs.
S04E08,GEORGE,"Oh, well, so what? Laughter - what is that? I mean, what is the point of opening your mouth and going ""Ha, ha!""? What is that? ""Ha, ha!""?"
S04E08,MR. ROSS,"You know, you can't get those cigars anywhere."
S04E08,MRS. ROSS,You and your cigars..
S04E08,MR. ROSS,(Shooting back at his wife) Wear some more lipstick.
S04E08,SUSAN,"Daddy, there's, um, there's something that we have to talk to you about.."
S04E08,MR. ROSS,"Oh, I forgot to ask you - how'd you like the cabin?"
S04E08,GEORGE,"(Even more nervous than before) Oh, the, uh, the cabin.. well, (Clears throat)"
S04E08,[Setting,Jerry's apartment]
S04E08,JERRY,"Right after we get off the phone, then you go and tell her that?! Well, of course she knows it was me who complained! Now I'm responsible for this woman's quitting. Oh, this is unbelievable!"
S04E08,ELAINE,(Full of guilt) I know! I screwed up. It's all my fault. Would you call her?
S04E08,JERRY,"(Caving in) Ohh.. dial the number. (Elaine picks up the phone, and starts to dial) How could you do this?"
S04E08,ELAINE,(Handing the phone over to him) I was just trying to help you.
S04E08,JERRY,"(Muttering) Oh, just trying to (Rudely grabs the phone from her) help me.. (Into the phone) Hello? Sandra? Hi, uh, this is Jerry Seinfeld. (Elaine now has her hand in a bowl of popcorn - grabbing a fistful) Listen, I - I just want to tell you, (Jerry sternly grabs Elaine's hand - forcing her to drop the popcorn, then shoves her hand away. Elaine sits back like a scolded child) There's been a terrible misunderstanding See, I told Elaine that, uh, it was a real treat talking to you on the phone, and she thought I was being sarcastic, you know, 'cause I'm a comedian and all. She thought I meant (Deeply sarcastic) ""Yeah, it was a real treat talking to her on the phone."" (Back to normal) You know, but I was really being sincere.. No, of course I like you.. Tonight? ..Um, uh, hold on a second. (To Elaine, whispering) Now she wants to have a drink with me. (Elaine mouths out ""Just go"" while making gestures. Jerry, again, gives in. Back on the phone) Yeah, I think I can.. Um.. yeah, I know where that is.. Ok.. uh, I'll see you there. Okay, bye. (Hangs up, peeved) Now I gotta have a drink with her."
S04E08,[Setting,The Ross' house]
S04E08,GEORGE,"The cabin.. (Laughs nervously) Well.. (Pauses as he thinks of a way to break the news, then decides to pass it off) Susan?"
S04E08,SUSAN,Uhh.. about the cabin..
S04E08,MR. ROSS,"(Cutting her off) I love that place. My father built that cabin in 1947. My mother was recuperating from Impetigo at the time, and dad thought it would be a good idea to get her out into the fresh air. She died there the following winter. And he passed away 10 years later to the day. His last words to me were, (Mrs. Ross, bored out of her mind, has obviously heard this story a million times - she mouths the words as Mr. Ross says them) ""Cherish the cabin."" Not, uh, ""Take care of your sister."" (Adding) She's a paraplegic. But, ""Cherish the cabin."" (Smiling, reflecting) And I have.. for 45 years. It's often been a.. sanctuary for me."
S04E08,GEORGE,(Annoyingly butting in) Kinda like Superman's fortress of solitude.
S04E08,MR. ROSS,What?
S04E08,GEORGE,"S, uh, Superman - he, uh, built the fortress of solitude up at the North Pole, to, uh, you know, sort of get away from it all.."
S04E08,MR. ROSS,"When I go, I'm passing it on to her. (Pointing at Susan)"
S04E08,MRS. ROSS,"(Drunk, she laughs out loud) I'll take a hotel any day."
S04E08,SUSAN,Daddy..
S04E08,MR. ROSS,Yes?
S04E08,SUSAN,"Daddy, about the cabin.."
S04E08,MRS. ROSS,"(Laughing, she points to her shirt) Look, Henry, I spilled wine on me! (Laughs again)"
S04E08,MR. ROSS,(To Susan) What about it?
S04E08,SUSAN,"Well, the thing is.."
S04E08,MR. ROSS,What? What is it?
S04E08,SUSAN,"Well, the - the cabin, is, kind of, uh.. George?"
S04E08,GEORGE,(Extremely blunt) Burned.
S04E08,MR. ROSS,Burned?
S04E08,SUSAN,"There was a fire, and it uh.."
S04E08,GEORGE,Burned.
S04E08,MR. ROSS,(Still trying to comprehend what has happened) The cabin burned?
S04E08,GEORGE,"(Laughs) yeah, burned. Whoo.."
S04E08,MRS. ROSS,(Laughing out loud) Burned! (George laughs with her)
S04E08,MR. ROSS,Was anything found? Was it all burned to the ground?! Did they find anything?
S04E08,SUSAN,(Solemn) No. Nothing.
S04E08,MRS. ROSS,"(Laughing, she's obviously getting a kick out of her husband's misfortune) Nothing! Ha, ha, ha."
S04E08,GEORGE,"Eh, but, you know, Mr. Ross, if - if you look at the whole situating, what with it being your cigars, and everything, it's really rather ironic - one might even say, in a sense, comical.. (Mr. Ross has, by now, left the room. Mrs. Ross is pointing at George, nodding, laughing. As if to say he hit the bullseye. George calls out to Mr. Ross) Really. Think about it."
S04E08,[Setting,Jerry's apartment]
S04E08,SANDRA,(Offended) I can't believe you said that!
S04E08,JERRY,What?!
S04E08,SANDRA,(Buttoning her jacket) How could you say something like that to me?!
S04E08,JERRY,What? What?! You were the one who was talking dirty. I was just trying to keep up!
S04E08,SANDRA,That was a weird thing to say.
S04E08,JERRY,Why? It didn't mean anything. I was just trying to join in so you wouldn't feel embarrassed.
S04E08,SANDRA,"Ohh, I think you're really sick."
S04E08,JERRY,(Getting slightly offended) I'm not sick. (Pointing at her) You - you said much sicker things than me.
S04E08,SANDRA,I'm leaving. (Moves toward the door. Jerry blocks her path)
S04E08,JERRY,I really think you're making too much of this.
S04E08,SANDRA,(Attempting to get past him) Excuse me. (They both move to the door)
S04E08,JERRY,Let me walk you to a cab.
S04E08,SANDRA,(Opens the door) That's ok.
S04E08,JERRY,"I mean, the main thing is that this is just between us, and that'll be the end of it."
S04E08,SANDRA,"Oh, really? (Quickly walks out)"
S04E08,JERRY,"(Calling after her) I mean, people - they're not interested in things like this. They don't want to hear about it. They really don't."
S04E08,[Setting,The Coffee shop]
S04E08,JERRY,"So, we're.. uhh, drinkin' and talkin', and uhh, so, she starts rubbing my leg."
S04E08,GEORGE,Wo-hoah! What did you do?
S04E08,JERRY,(Sarcastic) Have you ever told a woman to stop touching your leg?
S04E08,GEORGE,"Yeah, right."
S04E08,JERRY,"I mean, I know it's the wrong thing to do. She works in Elaine's office. I know it's wrong - but I can't get that hand off my leg. I mean, I'm looking at the hand, and I'm thinking, ""That hand should not be on my leg."" But I can't make my brain to get my mouth to say the words, ""Would you mind?!"""
S04E08,GEORGE,"Yeah, woman have no problem getting the hand off. How do they do that?"
S04E08,JERRY,"I don't know, they're working on a whole other level.."
S04E08,GEORGE,"Alright, so, go ahead."
S04E08,JERRY,So we go back to my apartment..
S04E08,GEORGE,(Expressing shock) Woah. Whoa! Woah!
S04E08,JERRY,"So, we're, uh, foolin' around there.. you know, it's getting a little passionate.. (Scoots closer to George, to prevent others from hearing) and, uh, she starts with the dirty talking."
S04E08,GEORGE,"(Putting his hands up) Alright, alright, hold on! (Jerry has George's full attention) Time out! Woah, woah! (Scooting in, giddy) What did she say?"
S04E08,JERRY,"(Modest) Oh, you know, the usual.."
S04E08,GEORGE,"No, I don't know. How do I know the usual?"
S04E08,JERRY,Typical things.
S04E08,GEORGE,(Picking up the ketchup) What typical? Gimme typical. Gimme some typical.
S04E08,JERRY,"She says, uh.. (Mumbles something inaudible. George, so shocked by what he's just heard, accidentally squeezes the ketchup bottle - ketchup squirts out and files off-screen. George reacts deeply)"
S04E08,GEORGE,(Breathing deeply) That's very dirty. (Jerry nods) That's absolutely filthy.
S04E08,JERRY,..And then she starts talking about her panties.
S04E08,GEORGE,(Yelling out to a waitress) Gonna need some water here!
S04E08,JERRY,So I said something.
S04E08,GEORGE,"Ok, what did you say?"
S04E08,JERRY,"(Defensively) Now, bear in mind, I am just trying to keep up."
S04E08,GEORGE,Of course.
S04E08,JERRY,"Okay? So, she's taking about her panties, so, uh.. So, I said, ""You mean the panties your mother laid out for you?"""
S04E08,GEORGE,"(Takes a few seconds to mull this one over. Shooting Jerry a confused look, he repeats it) ""The panties your mother laid out for you""? (Jerry nods) What does that mean?"
S04E08,JERRY,(Throwing up his hands) I don't know! It just popped out.
S04E08,GEORGE,"Well, how did she react?"
S04E08,JERRY,She flipped out! Just left.
S04E08,GEORGE,"Well, that's not offensive. (Reflects) It's abnormal, but it's not offensive."
S04E08,JERRY,"Look, the main thing is I don't want Elaine to know about any of this. I mean, especially the panty remark. I mean, it's embarrassing. And she's never let me hear the end of it."
S04E08,JERRY,"She will tell her. She's going back to work. I talked her into it - how stupid was that? (Changing subject as they both collect money to pay for the check) Hey, so, Susan's father took that news pretty hard, huh?"
S04E08,GEORGE,"Yeah, yeah. He went into the bedroom and started sobbing."
S04E08,JERRY,I guess he failed to see the humor in it.
S04E08,GEORGE,"Huh. (Makes a ""over his head"" gesture with his arm) C'mon, let's go, go. We got a lot of work to do today."
S04E08,JERRY,"(Getting up) Alright, big work day."
S04E08,GEORGE,That's right.

S04E08,GEORGE,"(Scoffs) No, I told you, I'm not gonna do that."

S04E08,ELAINE,Why? What happened? Did you talk?
S04E08,JERRY,Talk? Did I talk? It - you're darn right I talk to her! We talked up a storm - and I concluded from the basis of these talks that this isn't anybody you should be talking to.
S04E08,ELAINE,Really?
S04E08,JERRY,Yes.
S04E08,ELAINE,Really? You really think I should fire her?
S04E08,JERRY,"Oh yeah. Yeah, in fact, if George and I weren't so busy here working on the script, I'd do it myself."

S04E08,RICKY,(Blunt) I don't have one.

S04E08,SUSAN,"(Now gestures to an old woman in a wheelchair) And this is my Aunt, Sara."
S04E08,SARA,(Staring at George) He doesn't look like me.

S04E08,SARA,"Nothing, they're clean."
S04E08,MRS. ROSS,"Ricky, did you wipe her wheels off?"
S04E08,RICKY,(Annoyed) Yes.

S04E08,JERRY,What?! How?
S04E08,ELAINE,"I got Sandra transferred to another office upstairs, okay?! So, she blabs to Lippman about my long distance calls to Europe!"
S04E08,JERRY,What calls?!
S04E08,ELAINE,"Uh! I made a friend when I was in Europe, okay?! And we've been in touch, and Sandra told Lippman!"
S04E08,JERRY,"Oh, did - did she say anything else to you?"
S04E08,ELAINE,"(Confused) ""Anything else""? What do you mean ""anything else""?"
S04E08,JERRY,So she just left the office - didn't say a word to you about anything?
S04E08,ELAINE,Yeah!
S04E08,JERRY,(Smiling to himself) Beautiful.
S04E08,ELAINE,Why is that beautiful?
S04E08,JERRY,"Oh, no, not beautiful."
S04E08,ELAINE,It's four hundred and twenty nine dollars!
S04E08,JERRY,"Hey, look, I'm going to pay for that."
S04E08,ELAINE,"No, no."
S04E08,JERRY,"(Taking out his checkbook) No, I insist. I was the one who encouraged you to fire her - the whole thing was all my-"
S04E08,ELAINE,(Giving up too easy) Okay.
S04E08,JERRY,"(Pauses, noting Elaine's quick accept) fault. (Starts to write a check out, then stops, looking at the door) Do you smell smoke?"
S04E08,KRAMER,"Oh, hey! Hey, Jer, I want you to meet my new friends, here. (Introducing each one) This is, uh, Louis, Jorge, and Umberto."
S04E08,JERRY,"Oh, how you doing? Nice to meet you."
S04E08,KRAMER,"Yeah, we're heading up to Westchester - gonna hit the links."
S04E08,JERRY,"Oh. (Notices Louis' jacket) Isn't that, uh, your.."
S04E08,KRAMER,"(Trying to avoid the issue) Oh, yeah, yeah, Okay, we're going. (To his three friends) Vamanos, muchachos!"
S04E08,ELAINE,"(Turns to George, he is now reading a book) Hey, what are you reading?"
S04E08,GEORGE,"Oh, uh, ""The Falconer"" by John Cheever. It's really excellent."
S04E08,ELAINE,"(To Jerry) John Cheever, you ever read any of his stuff?"
S04E08,JERRY,"Uh, yeah, I'm familiar with some of his writing. (George shoots Jerry a smirk, then returns to his book) Alright, (Hand the check to Elaine) look, we gotta get back to work. We just had a big breakthrough here."
S04E08,ELAINE,"(Folding up the check) Ok, I'll leave you two alone."
S04E08,JERRY,(Moving back into the living room) Okay.
S04E08,ELAINE,"(In the door way) Maybe I'll go visit my mother. She just bought me some new panties (Jerry pauses right before sitting in his chair) and they're - all laid out for me. (Leaves, smiling to herself. Jerry and George both look at each other, frozen in their places)"
S04E09,JERRY,"(answering machine) leave a message and I?ll call you back, thanks. JOE DIVOLA Jerry, Joe Divola. *Pbt* *Pbt* *Pbt* I have a hair on my tongue, I can't get it off, you know how much I hate that? Course you do, you put it there. I know what you said about me Seinfeld. I know you badmouthed me to the execs at NBC, put the kibosh on my deal. Now I?m gonna put the kibosh on you. You know I?ve kiboshed before, and I will kibosh again."
S04E09,KRAMER,"So, what do you think?"
S04E09,JERRY,About what?
S04E09,KRAMER,About the opera.
S04E09,JERRY,"Nah, I don't wanna go."
S04E09,KRAMER,You gotta go.
S04E09,JERRY,"I-I-I don't like the opera. What are they singing for? Who sings? You got something to say, say it!"
S04E09,KRAMER,"Jerry, you don't understand, that?s the way they talk in Italy, they sing to one another. Kramer starts to sing in bad Italian."
S04E09,JERRY,"All right, all right."
S04E09,KRAMER,"That?s the way it was, you know. You listen to the language, its got that sing songy quality. It?s the language Jerry, the language"
S04E09,JERRY,So why don't they talk like that now?
S04E09,KRAMER,"Well its, uh, well its too hard to keep up, you know, they were tired."
S04E09,KRAMER,Better get that
S04E09,JERRY,Yeah?
S04E09,ELAINE,(intercom) it?s me!
S04E09,JERRY,Come on up.
S04E09,KRAMER,"So, huh?"
S04E09,JERRY,I don't know
S04E09,KRAMER,"Oh come on Jerry, its opening night, black tie, Pagliacci! The great clown, the great sad tragic clown, like you."
S04E09,JERRY,"Well it?s very flattering. How did you get these tickets, I heard they're impossible to get."
S04E09,KRAMER,"Oh, well I have many associates."
S04E09,JERRY,"I don't know, opera, it?s not my kind of thing."
S04E09,KRAMER,"All right, you not gonna go I?m not gonna go, I?m gonna call the whole thing off."
S04E09,JERRY,"No, wait a minute, wait a minute, that?s not fair, what about George, Susan and Elaine, what do you need me for?"
S04E09,KRAMER,"You're the nucleus, the straw that stirs the drink. You're the Miana!"
S04E09,JERRY,"Well I guess if I?m the Miana I should go. All right, all right."
S04E09,ELAINE,Hi!
S04E09,JERRY,Hi!
S04E09,KRAMER,Hey! Hi Elaine!

S04E09,KRAMER,"Well no, I don't have them on me."
S04E09,ELAINE,What? That?s why I came all the way over here.
S04E09,KRAMER,"My friends got 'em, I?m going to pick them up tomorrow."
S04E09,ELAINE,"Oh, I was gonna surprise Joey with them, you got an extra one right?"
S04E09,KRAMER,Oh yeah!

S04E09,JERRY,"Yeah, so Joey?s a great lover of the opera"
S04E09,ELAINE,"Listen, I got news for ya, its nice to be involved with somebody who?s interested in something other than nick at night. Now he?s got a grip on reality, he's happy, he's well adjusted."
S04E09,JERRY,Well I?m looking forward to meeting him.
S04E09,ELAINE,I've got to go
S04E09,JERRY,"Where are you going, what?s the rush?"
S04E09,ELAINE,"I'm going to surprise Joey, I?ve never been to his apartment so I?m just going to 'pop in'"
S04E09,JERRY,"Oh, good, men love that!"
S04E09,JERRY,Hey!

S04E09,KRAMER,"Steady, steady, now calm yourself, come on, now get a hold of yourself,"
S04E09,JERRY,What the hell he's supposed to be on medication I don't understand he told me he's getting medication what happened to his medication!?
S04E09,KRAMER,OK Quiet! Quiet! Now let me think!
S04E09,JERRY,"I'm gonna call the cops. That?s what I?m doing, I?m calling the cops."
S04E09,KRAMER,The cops? What are you calling the cops for? They?re not going to do anything!
S04E09,JERRY,"What do you mean they're not going to do anything, they're the cops, they gotta do something, he just put the kibosh on me, do you know what the kibosh means, its a kibosh!"
S04E09,KRAMER,Yiddigtkk ka kibosh.

S04E09,KRAMER,Call him and tell him
S04E09,JERRY,"That?s what I?ll do, I?ll just call him and tell him, I?ll tell him. That?s all I?ll do. He's a human being, I?ll talk to him. He'll understand. Right?"
S04E09,KRAMER,Right.... Don't mention my name
S04E09,JERRY,"Oh, I got the machine."
S04E09,KRAMER,What?s his message like?

S04E09,JERRY,"(into phone) Hello Joe, listen this is Jerry Seinfeld, I really think there?s been a huge colossal misunderstanding,"
S04E09,KRAMER,Big! Big!
S04E09,JERRY,"and I feel if we can just talk about this we can straighten the whole thing out, so listen, so call me back. Bye."
S04E09,ELAINE,Joey? Joey?
S04E09,ELAINE,"Oh god, oh, its you! You scared me!"
S04E09,JOE DIVOLA,Good. Fear is our most primal emotion.
S04E09,ELAINE,You left your door open.
S04E09,JOE DIVOLA,"I know, I like to encourage intruders."
S04E09,ELAINE,(laughs) What?s all this?
S04E09,JOE DIVOLA,Do you like it? My home is a shrine to you.
S04E09,ELAINE,Where did you get all these pictures?
S04E09,JOE DIVOLA,"I took them myself with a telephoto lens. Coming out of your office, your apartment, shopping, showering."
S04E09,ELAINE,Showering?
S04E09,JOE DIVOLA,I developed them myself in my dark room. Would you like to see?
S04E09,ELAINE,"In the dark room? Uh no, no thank you. Not right now. I'm a day person!... Are you all right?"
S04E09,JOE DIVOLA,Why
S04E09,ELAINE,"Well I don't know, you just don't seem yourself?"
S04E09,JOE DIVOLA,Who am I? Who am I supposed to be?
S04E09,ELAINE,"That?s a good question, good question, its very... exerstential! Who are you? Who am I? Yeah, well."
S04E09,JOE DIVOLA,What are you doing here?
S04E09,ELAINE,"Oh, nothing, I just stopped by to chat, you know, shoot the breeze."
S04E09,JOE DIVOLA,Were you able to get those opera tickets to Pagliacci from that friend of yours? I'm really looking forward to it.
S04E09,ELAINE,"Oh, no, he couldn't get them. We're not going."
S04E09,JOE DIVOLA,Really?
S04E09,ELAINE,"Oh, dammit, you know I just remembered I gotta go, I left something on, the gas, the lights, the water in the tub. Something is on somewhere so I?m just gonna get the uh.."
S04E09,JOE DIVOLA,"You know the story of Pagliacci, Nedda?"
S04E09,ELAINE,Uh.. I?m Elaine!
S04E09,JOE DIVOLA,He's a clown whose wife is unfaithful to him.
S04E09,ELAINE,Oh.
S04E09,JOE DIVOLA,"Do you think I?m a clown, Nedda?"
S04E09,ELAINE,"Do I think you're a clown? No, not if it?s bad to be a clown, if it?s bad to be a clown then you are definitely not a clown. But if its good to be a clown then, you know, I would have to rethink the whole thing."
S04E09,JOE DIVOLA,"You've betrayed me with another, haven't you, Nedda? Who is he. I want you to tell me who he is. I want his name. Tell me his name."
S04E09,ELAINE,"Oh, like any man would ever look at me, come on, I?m gonna... get out of here."
S04E09,JOE DIVOLA,Pagliacci kills his wife.
S04E09,ELAINE,"Se, now that?s terrible, that is not a nice thing to do at all, I don?t know how this Paliachi thing turns out but you know I would assume that there is big big trouble for that clown"
S04E09,JOE DIVOLA,You're not leaving
S04E09,JERRY,"(on phone) But officer, he threatened me! I don't understand, that?s not right! What if it was the President of the United States I bet you'd investigate. So what?s the difference, I?m a comedian of the United States, and I?ll tell you I?m under just as much pressure. Alright, thanks anyway, ok bye."
S04E09,JERRY,(cautiously) Who is it?
S04E09,GEORGE,It's George.
S04E09,GEORGE,"What, are you locking the door now?"
S04E09,JERRY,"Well, well, look at you. It?s a little skimpy there isn't it?"
S04E09,GEORGE,"Do you know the last time I wore this thing? Six years ago, when I made that toast at Bobby Leighton's wedding."
S04E09,JERRY,"Ooo, that was a bad toast."
S04E09,GEORGE,It wasn't that bad.
S04E09,JERRY,I never heard anybody curse in a toast.
S04E09,GEORGE,I was trying to loosen 'em up a little bit.
S04E09,JERRY,"There were old people there, all the relatives. You were like a Red Fox record. I mean, at the end of the toast nobody even drank. They were just standing there, they were just frozen! That might have been one of the worst all time toasts."
S04E09,GEORGE,"Alright, still her father didn't have to throw me out like that, he could have just asked me to leave. The guy had me in a headlock! Susan's not going tonight you know."
S04E09,JERRY,What do you mean not going? why not?
S04E09,GEORGE,"I don't know, she said she had to pick up a friend of hers at the airport. It cost me a hundred dollars this ticket."
S04E09,JERRY,Why doesn't she pay for hers?
S04E09,GEORGE,"That's a very good question. You know she and I go out for dinner, she doesn't even reach for the check. That?s all I?m asking for is a reach. Is that so much to ask for?"
S04E09,JERRY,It's nice to get a reach.
S04E09,JERRY,Who is it?
S04E09,KRAMER,It's me!
S04E09,KRAMER,"What, are you locking the door now?"
S04E09,JERRY,Because of Divola! Get in here... How come you're not dressed?
S04E09,KRAMER,I am dressed.
S04E09,JERRY,You're going like this?
S04E09,KRAMER,Yeah. Hey I want you to hear something.
S04E09,JERRY,I thought you said people dress up when they go to the opera!
S04E09,KRAMER,"People do, I don't."
S04E09,JERRY,"Well what about me! If you're going like that, I?m not going like this."
S04E09,GEORGE,"Wait a minute, wait a minute, do you think I?m comfortable here. I can't change, I?ve got no clothes here! You've got to go like that, I can?t go like this alone!"
S04E09,JERRY,Why should I be uncomfortable just because my apartment is closer to town hall than yours?
S04E09,GEORGE,"That?s not the issue, we're friends, if I?ve got to be uncomfortable, you've got to be uncomfortable too!"
S04E09,JERRY,"All right, all right, I?ll wear this. It's bad enough I?ve got to go to the opera I?ve got to sit next to ozzie nelson over here."
S04E09,JERRY,Would you turn that down! What is that crap!
S04E09,KRAMER,It's Pagliacci!
S04E09,JERRY,"Oh beautiful. Listen, we've got a little problem here, we've got two extra tickets."
S04E09,KRAMER,Why? What happened?
S04E09,JERRY,Well Susan isn't going and Elaine just left me a message her friend isn't going either.
S04E09,KRAMER,"That?s fantastic! We'll scalp the tickets, we'll make maybe five hundred a ticket."
S04E09,GEORGE,What? Really?
S04E09,KRAMER,Yeah.
S04E09,GEORGE,People are looking for tickets here?
S04E09,KRAMER,"What, are you kidding? Opening night Pavarotti and Pagliacci. Ha, we're gonna clean up!"
S04E09,GEORGE,Oh man! I knew I was gonna love the opera.
S04E09,JERRY,Oh yeah right.
S04E09,KRAMER,"OK come on, let?s go get the tickets."
S04E09,GEORGE,"All right, all right."
S04E09,JERRY,"All right, you guys listen, I've got to wait here for Elaine, I'll meet you in front of the theatre."
S04E09,GEORGE,"Oh, wait, isn't scalping illegal?"
S04E09,KRAMER,Oh yeah!
S04E09,JERRY,You sprayed him in the eyes with Binaca?
S04E09,ELAINE,"Cherry Binaca, it?s new."
S04E09,JERRY,"See, I don't get that. First they come out with the regular, then a year later they come out with the cherry. They know that we like the cherry, start with cherry! Then come out with the regular!"
S04E09,ELAINE,It's like I didn't even know him. He's like a totally different person.
S04E09,JERRY,"Well you should hear the message from my nut. Where's George and Kramer, I want to get inside already, I don't like standing out here, I feel very vulnerable."
S04E09,JERRY,"Hey, hey, what are you doing, that?s my quarter."
S04E09,MAN#1,"No it's not, it's mine."
S04E09,JERRY,"I was just flipping it, it's mine."
S04E09,MAN#1,"No, I dropped it, it's mine."
S04E09,JERRY,"All right, do you want the quarter, take the quarter, but don't try and tell me it's yours."
S04E09,MAN#1,Well it is mine.
S04E09,JERRY,"What, do you think I care about the money? Is that what you think? You want me to show you what I care about money? Here look, here look at this, here's a dollar here look, there, that?s how much I care about money."
S04E09,MAN#1,"You think I care about money, that?s how much I care about money, I don't care about money."
S04E09,JERRY,"Oh yeah, well why don?t you Just get lost."
S04E09,MAN#1,Why don't you get lost.
S04E09,JERRY,"Because I was standing here, that?s why."
S04E09,MAN#1,Oh Yeah?
S04E09,JERRY,Yeah!
S04E09,JERRY,"I kinda like this opera crowd, I feel tough... Anybody else got a problem?"
S04E09,PARK GUY#1,Hey clown!
S04E09,PARK GUY#2,hey clown!
S04E09,PARK GUY#1,"Make us laugh, clown!"
S04E09,PARK GUY#2,"Nice face, clown!"
S04E09,PARK GUY#2,"Make me laugh, clown!"
S04E09,KRAMER,"I got two, I got two huh, Paliachi, who needs two, Pagliacci, come on, the great tragic clown, come on, check it out, he laughs, he cries, he sings, Pagliacci. Hey, I got two beauties right here, check it out all right."

S04E09,MAN#2,I'll give you five hundred for the pair.
S04E09,GEORGE,"Ok, it's a deal!"
S04E09,KRAMER,Pzzzt. No.
S04E09,GEORGE,No? Are you crazy?
S04E09,KRAMER,"Look, let me handle this."
S04E09,GEORGE,"Five hundred dollars, that?s a great deal!"
S04E09,KRAMER,"You're blowing this, the guys a pigeon."
S04E09,GEORGE,Did you see that? The guy's walking away. What is wrong with you? That was a three hundred dollar profit.
S04E09,KRAMER,"Look, I know what I?m doing here George."
S04E09,GEORGE,"This is not a Metallica concert, it?s an opera alright, a little dignity, a little class, just give me my ticket, I will stand over here and sell it."
S04E09,KRAMER,"Oh, yeah."
S04E09,GEORGE,"Thank you very much. You just stand over there, I?ll stand over here."
S04E09,KRAMER,I know where I?m standing.
S04E09,GEORGE,Alright.
S04E09,KRAMER,Hey!
S04E09,GEORGE,(shouting) Get your Paliachi!
S04E09,JERRY,Where are they already?
S04E09,ELAINE,I guarantee they don't sell either one of those tickets.
S04E09,JERRY,"Hey, look, there's Bobby Eighteen?s father-in-law, Mr Reichman. George and I were just talking about that today, I can?t believe it! That?s the guy who threw George out of the wedding."
S04E09,ELAINE,"Oh, yeah, when George made that bad toast!"
S04E09,JERRY,Do you remember the curse toast?
S04E09,ELAINE,"Oh yeah, the curse toast."
S04E09,JERRY,"So, can you believe that message? Now I?ve got to spend the rest of my life looking over my shoulder."
S04E09,ELAINE,Me too
S04E09,JERRY,Crazy Joe Divola
S04E09,ELAINE,How do you know his name?
S04E09,JERRY,What do you mean? Why wouldn't I know his name?
S04E09,ELAINE,I never told you his name.
S04E09,JERRY,I never told you his name.
S04E09,ELAINE,"Wait a second, who are we talking about here?"
S04E09,JERRY,Joe Divola.
S04E09,ELAINE,"Right, Joe Divola"
S04E09,JERRY,How do you know his name?
S04E09,ELAINE,"I've been out with him three times, I should know the mans name."
S04E09,JERRY,"Oh my god, its Joe Divola"
S04E09,ELAINE,Is he stalking you? are you kidding me?
S04E09,JERRY,That madman is trying to kill me.
S04E09,ELAINE,"Oh, Jerry, why didn't you tell me his name! Oh my god, he accused me of seeing someone else, he said tell me his name, he said tell me his name!!"
S04E09,JERRY,"Oh! He said that! Can you imagine what he'll do if he sees me with you! He'll think I?m the one who ruined his deal at NBC and took away his girl, he'll put a kibosh on me!"
S04E09,ELAINE,"Oooohh, what about me!"
S04E09,JOE DIVOLA,Excuse me
S04E09,ELAINE & JERRY,Aaahhhhh!!
S04E09,GEORGE,But this is Pavarotti!
S04E09,MAN#3,"Three hundred dollars, that?s a lot of money."
S04E09,MR REICHMAN,"You know Steven Holstman (?) did a production at Tunis last yeas and from what I understand, the Moslems really took to it."
S04E09,GEORGE,"All right, I?ll tell you what, you seem like a nice guy, let?s stop jerking around. Give me.. two hundred and fifty dollars, I?ve got people waiting for me, I've got to get the hell out of here."
S04E09,MR REICHMAN,Scalping! I told them to put out extra security.. Excuse me.
S04E09,GEORGE,"Hey pop, would you buzz off, I've got something cooking."
S04E09,MR REICHMAN,Costanza!?
S04E09,GEORGE,Mr Reichman?
S04E09,MR REICHMAN,You've still got a mouth like a surd give me those tickets.
S04E09,MRS REICHMAN,"Harold, no, Harold, Harold be careful of you're hair transplant!"
S04E09,JOE DIVOLA,"Anything is welcome, I accept change."
S04E09,JERRY,"I don't have anything, I gave it to that guy."
S04E09,JOE DIVOLA,"You know, you could just say no, you don't have to humiliate me. I may be dressed as a clown but I am a person."
S04E09,JERRY,"I'm telling you, the guy took....."
S04E09,JOE DIVOLA,And I don't need people like you looking down their noses at me. I am just a street performer out here trying to make enough to get by.
S04E09,MRS REICHMAN,Doctor! Doctor! Is there a doctor anywhere!
S04E09,JOE DIVOLA,"What, are you showing off to your girlfriend here, is that it?"
S04E09,ELAINE,"I'm not his girlfriend. We dated for a while, but things didn't really work out."
S04E09,JOE DIVOLA,You people make me sick.
S04E09,JERRY,That is one angry clown!
S04E09,JERRY,"The hardest part about being a clown, it seems to me, would be that you're constantly referred to as a clown. ""Who was that clown?"", ""I'm not working with that clown, did you hire that clown?"", ""The guy's a clown!"". How do you even start into being a clown, how do you know that you want to be a clown, I guess you get to a point where you're pants look so bad, it's actually easier to become a clown than having the proper alterations done. Because if you think about it, a clown, if there isn't a circus around them, is really just a very annoying person. You're in the back seat of this guys Volkswagen, ""What, you're picking somebody else up? Oh man!"""
S04E09,JERRY,"(Singing) Camera, curtains, lights - This is it, we'll hit the heights - Oh what heights we'll hit - On with the show this is it!"
S04E09,ELAINE,"You know, it is so sad, all your knowledge of high culture comes from bugs bunny cartoons."
S04E09,JERRY,"Oh there's that clown again, what does he want from me. Look I?m serious, I?m not kidding, I don't have the quarter, that guy took it."
S04E09,JOE DIVOLA,I don't want any money.
S04E09,ELAINE,I smell cherry.
S04E09,JOE DIVOLA,It's Binaca.
S04E09,JERRY,Binaca?
S04E09,GEORGE,What did we say? Two seventy-five?
S04E09,MAN#3,Two fifty.
S04E09,GEORGE,Two fifty? Are you sure
S04E09,MAN#3,"Yeah, yeah, I?m sure."
S04E09,GEORGE,"All right, all right, two fifty."
S04E09,SUSAN,George!
S04E09,GEORGE,S-Susan
S04E09,SUSAN,"I can't believe it, I?m so glad I caught you."
S04E09,GEORGE,"What are you doing here, I though you were going to the airport."
S04E09,SUSAN,"Oh, there was some problem with the plane, they landed in Philadelphia."
S04E09,GEORGE,"So what, they don?t have another plane? She couldn't take a bus?"
S04E09,SUSAN,She's coming in tomorrow. I made it!
S04E09,GEORGE,"Yeah you made it, how about that."
S04E09,SUSAN,"Oh, I?m so excited, now we get to see the opera together."
S04E09,GEORGE,We get to go to the opera together!
S04E09,SUSAN,Who's that?
S04E09,GEORGE,"That?s-that?s-Harry Fong, he's a very good friend of mine and he's a big opera buff. Enjoy the show there harry!... You know what."
S04E09,JERRY,"Come on, you gotta let us in"
S04E09,USHER,Not without tickets.
S04E09,JERRY,"We have tickets, we just don't have 'em with us."
S04E09,USHER,Well that?s a problem. Excuse me.
S04E09,JERRY,"You don't understand, someone's after us, a crazy clown is trying to kill us."
S04E09,USHER,A crazy clown is after you? Oh that?s rich. Now clear the entrance so people with tickets can get through.
S04E09,JERRY&ELAINE,"We're with him, we're with him."
S04E09,KRAMER,Are you guys ready?
S04E09,JERRY&ELAINE,"Yeah, Yeah!!"
S04E09,KRAMER,Have you seen George?
S04E09,JERRY,We thought he was with you.
S04E09,ELAINE,"Come on, he's on his own, come on!"
S04E09,KRAMER,These are great seats huh?
S04E09,ELAINE,Yeah
S04E09,KRAMER,Yeah
S04E09,JERRY,"Boy, some cast, huh? Pavarotti, Aver Martone."
S04E09,ELAINE,"Aver Martone. I've heard of her, who's she playing?"
S04E09,JERRY,"She's playing, Pagliacci?s wife, Nedda."
S04E09,ELAINE,Nedda?
S04E09,JERRY,Yeah.
S04E09,ELAINE,Oh my god..
S04E09,MAN#3,"Excuse me, excuse me, excuse me."
S04E09,JERRY,Susan! What are you doing here?
S04E09,SUSAN,My Friend's flight couldn?t make it.
S04E09,JERRY,Where's George?
S04E09,MAN#3,I got his ticket.
S04E09,SUSAN,He decided not to come. He said he was uncomfortable.
S04E09,JERRY,"Uncomfortable? How does you think I feel?.. Hey let me ask you something, how much did you pay for that ticket?"
S04E09,MAN#3,One seventy-five.
S04E09,JERRY,"Kramer, who'd you sell your ticket to?"
S04E09,KRAMER,Some nut in a clown suit!
S04E09,JERRY,"I had some friends drag me to an opera recently, you know how they've got those little opera glasses, you know, do you really need binoculars, I mean how big do these people have to get before you can spot 'em. These opera kids they're going two-fifty, two-eighty, three-twenty-five, they're wearing big white woolly vests, the women have like the breastplates, the bullet hats with the horn coming out. If you can't pick these people out, forget opera, think about optometry, maybe that?s more you're thing."
S04E10,JERRY,We're dead.
S04E10,GEORGE,We're not dead.
S04E10,JERRY,We are dead.
S04E10,GEORGE,Come on. We got all day tomorrow to come up with a story.
S04E10,JERRY,All day tomorrow? We had a month and a half to come up with something and we didn't do anything.
S04E10,GEORGE,So we'll do it tomorrow.
S04E10,JERRY,Let me ask you something. When's the last time you went skiing?
S04E10,GEORGE,About six years ago.
S04E10,JERRY,I think you can take the lift ticket off your jacket now.
S04E10,GEORGE,Women like skiers.
S04E10,JERRY,So what? You can't meet anybody. You're going on with Susan.
S04E10,GEORGE,Yeah. Right.
S04E10,JERRY,"Hey, see those two women over there? I almost dated the one on the right. She's in the closet business."
S04E10,GEORGE,The closet business? What's the closet business?
S04E10,JERRY,What is it your business?
S04E10,GEORGE,I'm interested.
S04E10,JERRY,She reorganizes your closet and shows you how to maximize your closet space. She looked into my closet.
S04E10,GEORGE,So you thought she was good looking and figured this would be a good way to meet her.
S04E10,JERRY,Yeah.
S04E10,GEORGE,Yeah. So what happened?
S04E10,JERRY,"So, she mentioned she had a boyfriend and then it hit me. What do I need more closet space for? (Across the room) Hi, Marla."
S04E10,MARLA,(Walks over to Jerry and George) Jerry.
S04E10,JERRY,"George, Marla."
S04E10,GEORGE,Marla.
S04E10,MARLA,"George. Jerry, Stacey."
S04E10,JERRY,Stacey.
S04E10,STACEY,Jerry.
S04E10,JERRY,"George, Stacey."
S04E10,GEORGE,Stacey.
S04E10,STACEY,George.
S04E10,JERRY,George.
S04E10,GEORGE,Jerry. Marla. (Realizing Jerry's cue) Stacey! (Walks over to Stacey)
S04E10,MARLA,"So, how was your trip to Berlin?"
S04E10,JERRY,Trip to Berlin?
S04E10,MARLA,Remember? That's why you put off doing the closets. You said you were going to Berlin for a while.
S04E10,JERRY,"Oh, right, right."
S04E10,MARLA,"The wall had just come down, and you told me you wanted to be part of the celebration."
S04E10,JERRY,"Yes, yes, I did. But, you know, I was watching it on CNN, and they covered it so well I thought, ""Why knock my brains out?"""
S04E10,MARLA,"You, know my boyfriend went."
S04E10,JERRY,Really?
S04E10,MARLA,"Yes, I told him all about you going and he got all excited and decided to go."
S04E10,JERRY,"Oh, did he like it?"
S04E10,MARLA,I don't know. He never came back. (Over to the other side of the bar)
S04E10,GEORGE,"Anyway, we met with NBC about a month ago and they gave us the green light to go ahead and write a pilot. In fact, we got a big meeting with them tomorrow. They gotta approve of the story before we can write."
S04E10,STACEY,"Wow, what a great job. A writer."
S04E10,GEORGE,Not a bad way to make a buck.
S04E10,STACEY,Sounds great.
S04E10,GEORGE,"Well, I'll tell you, Stacey. It's a lot of hard work. But, it comes fairly easy to me. Some people write symphonies. This is my gift. (Raises ski lift ticket while Stacey looks away)"
S04E10,JERRY,"So, are you gonna go out with her?"
S04E10,GEORGE,I might.
S04E10,JERRY,What about Susan?
S04E10,GEORGE,What? I'm not married. I'm not allowed to go out with somebody else?
S04E10,JERRY,Depends.
S04E10,GEORGE,Depends on what?
S04E10,JERRY,On many factors.
S04E10,GEORGE,Like what?
S04E10,JERRY,"Well, how long you've been seeing her. What's your phone call frequency? Are you on a daily?"
S04E10,GEORGE,No. Semi-daily. Four or five times a week.
S04E10,JERRY,"What about Saturday nights? Do you have to ask her out, or is a date implied?"
S04E10,GEORGE,Implied.
S04E10,JERRY,She got anything in your medicine cabinet?
S04E10,GEORGE,There might be some moisturizer.
S04E10,JERRY,Ah hah. Let me ask you this. Is there any tampax in your house?
S04E10,GEORGE,(Pause) Yeah.
S04E10,JERRY,"Well, I'll tell you what you've got here."
S04E10,GEORGE,What?
S04E10,JERRY,You got yourself a girlfriend.
S04E10,GEORGE,"Ah, no, no. Are you sure? A girlfriend?"
S04E10,JERRY,"I'm looking at a guy in a semi-daily with tampax in his house and an implied date on Saturday night. I would like to help you out, but..."
S04E10,GEORGE,"Would you believe my luck? The first time in my life I have a good answer to the question, ""What do you do?"" and I have a girlfriend. I mean, you don't need a girlfriend when you can answer that question. That's what you say in order to get girlfriends. Once you can get a girlfriend, you don't want a girlfriend, you just want more girlfriends."
S04E10,JERRY,You're going to make a good father someday.
S04E10,GEORGE,"Well it's not fair, Jerry. It's just not fair. All right, all right. That's it. I'm getting out of this thing."
S04E10,JERRY,Fine. Break up with her. But you know what this means?
S04E10,GEORGE,"No, what?"
S04E10,JERRY,"The script, the pilot, the TV show. That's all over."
S04E10,GEORGE,Why? What do you mean?
S04E10,JERRY,"Figure it out. She's one of the executives at NBC that's gonna make the decision whether or not they pick up the show. She's one of our biggest fans. You drop her off, you think they're gonna pick us up?"
S04E10,GEORGE,"Oh, right. Oh no, man."
S04E10,JERRY,"you know, it's a very interesting situation. Here you have a job that can get you girls. But, you also have a relationship. But if you try and get rid of the relationship so you can get the girls, you lose the job. You see the irony?"
S04E10,GEORGE,"Yeah, yeah. I see the irony. All right. What about this? What if I can find some way to break up with her so that she'll still like me and it doesn't affect the deal."
S04E10,JERRY,"(sarcastically) Oh, yeah."
S04E10,GEORGE,"Wait, wait. Here me out. Don't dismiss this. You're very quick to dismiss. Don't dismiss. She's got a big crush on David Letterman, I mean, a big crush. She talks about him all the time. Suppose I go up to David Letterman. He works at NBC; I work at NBC. I explain my situation. He agrees to meet her. They go out, they fall madly in love. And she dumps me for David Letterman."
S04E10,JERRY,This is your plan?
S04E10,GEORGE,"No, no. I'm just thinking."
S04E10,JERRY,I don't think you are.
S04E10,MARLA,Let me tell you what I think.
S04E10,JERRY,"Please, and be brutal. I have no closet sensitivity."
S04E10,MARLA,Are you very fussy about your pants?
S04E10,JERRY,I don't think I am.
S04E10,MARLA,Because I have a very radical idea. Can you handle it?
S04E10,JERRY,Try me.
S04E10,MARLA,"Here's what I'm proposing. We eliminate all this. The hangers, the bar, the shelves. And in its place install a series of hooks. We'll put everything on hooks."
S04E10,JERRY,Everything?
S04E10,MARLA,"Everything. The shirts, pants, sport jackets, pajamas. We could get eighty hooks on here."
S04E10,JERRY,"You're quite mad, you know. (Kramer enters) Oh, I don't believe this. (Goes into other room) Hey?"
S04E10,KRAMER,Hey.
S04E10,JERRY,What are you doing?
S04E10,KRAMER,I'm watching The Bold and the Beautiful.
S04E10,JERRY,No.
S04E10,KRAMER,What?
S04E10,JERRY,This is not a good time.
S04E10,KRAMER,Five minutes. What?
S04E10,JERRY,What did you have to give your TV away to George for?
S04E10,KRAMER,"Because I've been watching too much. It was an addiction. I couldn't stop. It was, it was destroying my brain cells."
S04E10,JERRY,"Yeah, but now you're in here all the time. (Marla enters from other room)"
S04E10,KRAMER,"Well, wow."
S04E10,JERRY,"Marla, Kramer."
S04E10,KRAMER,Hey.
S04E10,JERRY,Why don't you go out? It's nice out.
S04E10,KRAMER,"Oh, no. There's nothing out there for me."
S04E10,JERRY,There's weather.
S04E10,KRAMER,Weather? I don't need weather. Weather doesn't do it for me.
S04E10,JERRY,I'm tellin' George to give you your TV back.
S04E10,KRAMER,"No, no, I don't want it back. (Pause) Are you gonna watch the Knick game tonight?"
S04E10,JERRY,I don't know.
S04E10,KRAMER,Will you tape it?
S04E10,JERRY,Kramer... (points to Marla)
S04E10,KRAMER,Yeah. (He exits)
S04E10,JERRY,So your boyfriend never came back from Berlin.
S04E10,MARLA,Never came back.
S04E10,JERRY,"Oh, you must have been devastated being left for a wall."
S04E10,MARLA,It was about to end anyway. There was this... problem.
S04E10,JERRY,Ah hah. (Buzzer) Excuse me one second. Yeah?
S04E10,ELAINE,It's me.
S04E10,JERRY,"Come on up. Oh, it's Elaine, she's just a friend of mine. I don't know what she's doing here now. (Buzzer) I'm sorry. What?"
S04E10,ELAINE,I didn't get it.
S04E10,JERRY,Ugh. So you were saying there was this problem.
S04E10,MARLA,"Well, he wanted me to move in with him."
S04E10,JERRY,Snapple?
S04E10,MARLA,No thanks.
S04E10,JERRY,Go on.
S04E10,MARLA,Well I wouldn't move in because...
S04E10,JERRY,Yes.
S04E10,MARLA,Well because...
S04E10,JERRY,Yeah.
S04E10,MARLA,Well because I'm a virgin. (Elaine enters)
S04E10,ELAINE,Hello!
S04E10,JERRY,"Hi, um. Marla, Elaine."
S04E10,ELAINE,"I'm sorry, I didn't know you had company. I just wanted to return your tape."
S04E10,JERRY,"Oh, thanks a lot, two weeks late. Now that costs me thirty-five dollars to see Havana."
S04E10,ELAINE,"I'm sorry, I really am. I just kept forgetting."
S04E10,MARLA,I should be going.
S04E10,ELAINE,"No, no, I'm leaving."
S04E10,JERRY,I like that thing in your hair there.
S04E10,ELAINE,Oh yeah? This woman was selling them at this crazy party I was at last night. You'll appreciate this. Snapple?
S04E10,MARLA,No thanks.
S04E10,ELAINE,"I was talking to this guy, you know, and I just happened to throw my purse on the sofa. And my diaphragm goes flying out. So I just froze, you know, ahh! Staring at my diaphragm. You know, it's just lying there. So then, this woman, the one who sold me this hair thing, she grabbed it before the guy noticed, so. I mean, big deal, right? So I carry around my diaphragm, who doesn't? Yeah, like it's a big, big secret that women carry around their diaphragms. You never know when you're gonna need it, right? (Sips the Snapple) Ahh."
S04E10,MARLA,I should be going.
S04E10,JERRY,So we'll talk about the hooks then?
S04E10,MARLA,Yes. (She exits)
S04E10,ELAINE,What? Was it something I said?
S04E10,JERRY,"She's a virgin, she just told me."
S04E10,ELAINE,Well I didn't know.
S04E10,JERRY,Well it's not like spotting a toupee.
S04E10,ELAINE,Well you think I should say something? Should I say something? Should I apologize? Was I being anti-virgin?
S04E10,JERRY,"No, no, I mean..."
S04E10,ELAINE,'Cause I'm not anti-virgin. I'll be right back. (She leaves)
S04E10,JERRY,"Elaine, Elaine... (Buzzer) Yeah?"
S04E10,GEORGE,It's George.
S04E10,GEORGE,She's a virgin?
S04E10,JERRY,A virgin.
S04E10,GEORGE,Wow. So what're you gonna do?
S04E10,JERRY,"I don't know. I'm very attracted to her. That accent, it's so sexy."
S04E10,GEORGE,"I don't think I could do it. You know, they always remember the first time. I don't want to be remembered. I wanna be forgotten."
S04E10,JERRY,"You need a little pioneer spirit. You know, you don't have any of that Lewis and Clark in you."
S04E10,GEORGE,"You know, sometimes those guys don't make it back. (Looks in fridge) I'm really hungry."
S04E10,JERRY,"Yeah, me too."
S04E10,GEORGE,We gotta get something. I don't want to go to that meeting on an empty stomach. Let's get some Chinese. You wanna order it?
S04E10,JERRY,"All right, but then we gotta get some work done. Let me just call Kramer, see if want anything. (Calls) Hey, we ordering Chinese food. If you want anything-- (Kramer enters quickly) let me know what it is and I'll order for you."
S04E10,KRAMER,I'm in. Let's go for it.
S04E10,GEORGE,What do you want?
S04E10,KRAMER,"I don't care, whatever."
S04E10,GEORGE,I'll tell you what. Why don't we just get a couple of dishes and we'll just share 'em.
S04E10,KRAMER,Okay. What are you getting?
S04E10,GEORGE,I'm gonna get a Chow Fung.
S04E10,KRAMER,What's a Chow Fung?
S04E10,GEORGE,It's a broad noodle.
S04E10,KRAMER,"What do you mean, a broad noodle?"
S04E10,GEORGE,It's a big flat noodle.
S04E10,KRAMER,Well I don't want a big flat noodle.
S04E10,GEORGE,What kind of noodle do you want?
S04E10,KRAMER,Who says I want a noodle?
S04E10,GEORGE,"All right, look. I'm getting the Chow Fung. You don't have to have any."
S04E10,KRAMER,All right. I'll get pea pods and you can't have any of my pea pods.
S04E10,GEORGE,Fine.
S04E10,KRAMER,Get extra MSG.
S04E10,ELAINE,"Look, Marla. This whole sex thing is totally overrated. Now, here's the one thing you've gotta be ready for is how the man changes into a completely different person five seconds after it's over. I mean, something happens to their personality it's really quite astounding. It's like they committed a crime and they want to flee the scene before the police get there."
S04E10,MARLA,So they just leave?
S04E10,ELAINE,"Yeah, pretty much, yeah. Well, the smart ones start working on their getaway stories during dinner. How, you know, they gotta get up early tomorrow. What is about being up early? They all turn into farmers suddenly."
S04E10,MARLA,Wow. It must be pretty good to put up with all that.
S04E10,ELAINE,Eh.
S04E10,JERRY,"All right, let's go. We don't have much time before the meeting."
S04E10,GEORGE,Where's the food? What happened to Ping?
S04E10,JERRY,"Don't worry, he'll be here. Look, we only got about two hours. We just need to come up with one good story so we can get through this meeting. (Buzzer) There's your food."
S04E10,GEORGE,"Hey, what about this? I'm in a car accident. The motorist is uninsured, you with me?"
S04E10,JERRY,Yeah.
S04E10,GEORGE,"My car's totaled. It's all his fault and now, he has absolutely no money. There is no way that he can pay me. So the judge decrees that he becomes my butler."
S04E10,JERRY,Your butler?
S04E10,GEORGE,"Right. He cooks my food, he cleans my house, he does all my shopping for me. And there you go, that's your program."
S04E10,JERRY,What about me?
S04E10,GEORGE,"Don't worry, we'll find something for you. (Knock of Jerry's door)"
S04E10,JERRY,"(Getting the door) That's the stupidest idea I ever heard. Sentenced to be a butler. (Elaine, Marla, and an injured Ping are at the door) Ping, what happened?"
S04E10,ELAINE,There was a bit of an accident.
S04E10,PING,Head hurts. Head really hurts.
S04E10,JERRY,What happened?
S04E10,ELAINE,"Marla and I went out for coffee and afterwards I was crossing the street and he was biking right towards me. So I got out of the way just in time, but then he ran into a parked car. He hit his head and everything went flying."
S04E10,GEORGE,Something happened to the food?
S04E10,PING,I only saved one bag.
S04E10,JERRY,Should I call an ambulance? Do you wanna see a doctor?
S04E10,MARLA,I'll get some ice.
S04E10,GEORGE,(After looking in the bag) The pea pods? All you saved was the pea pods? (Kramer enters)
S04E10,KRAMER,"Hey, you got the food?"
S04E10,JERRY,"Yeah, here."
S04E10,KRAMER,"What took you so long? Hey, Ping!"
S04E10,PING,Kramer. (Kramer and George sit on the couch)
S04E10,KRAMER,Yeah. Where's yours?
S04E10,GEORGE,He dropped it.
S04E10,KRAMER,"Oh, that's too bad."
S04E10,ELAINE,"You should slow down, you know that? It's dangerous to go that fast."
S04E10,PING,"No, no. I have green light. You jaywalked."
S04E10,KRAMER,"(To Jerry) Hey, you watchin' Oprah?"
S04E10,ELAINE,(To Ping) I did not jaywalk.
S04E10,JERRY,(To George) You're givin' him back that TV.
S04E10,PING,"(To Elaine) Yes, you jaywalked."
S04E10,KRAMER,"(To Jerry) No, I don't want it back."
S04E10,PING,(To Elaine) Jaywalker. I could slap suit on you.
S04E10,GEORGE,(To Jerry) We got work to do. What about the meeting?
S04E10,KRAMER,"(To himself) Hey, look. An hour with Patrick Swayze."
S04E10,JERRY,"A month and a half we had. We did nothing. I can't believe we put it off until today and then we couldn't do anything because Elaine runs out to apologize to a virgin, crosses against a light, and knocks over a Chinese delivery boy. Now we're gonna make fools of ourselves, we got nothing. You're not even in show business. I gotta reputation. You drag me into the sewer with you. I've been on TV buddy boy. You know how fast word spreads in show business? It's like that (Snaps in George's face) , like that! One bad impression, you're outta the business!"
S04E10,GEORGE,"All right, let's postpone it. Let's get out of here."
S04E10,JERRY,What do you mean? They know we're here.
S04E10,GEORGE,"I'll fake an illness. (Acts it out) My back! My back! I can't believe, my back."
S04E10,JERRY,"No, no, would you get up?"
S04E10,GEORGE,"I can do this, Jerry."
S04E10,JERRY,No.
S04E10,GEORGE,"All right, I'll tell them my sister died. (Starts fake crying) My poor sister died. She was standing and then she was laughing and then they SHOT her! That's the kind of sick city that we're livin' in. They shoot you for laughing. I must go and comfort my poor family. Jerry, take me home so I can comfort my... my poor family."
S04E10,JERRY,What?
S04E10,GEORGE,That's David Letterman. I just saw David Letterman walk by. I'll be right back. (He exits)
S04E10,WOMAN,"Mr. Seinfeld, they're ready for you. (She exits)"
S04E10,JERRY,"Yes, I was very wise to hitch my wagon to his star. (Jerry enters meeting)"
S04E10,MAN #1,"Hey, Jerry."
S04E10,JERRY,"Hi, how are you doing? Nice to see you all here. Hello."
S04E10,RITA,"Hello, Jerry. I'm Rita Kearson."
S04E10,JERRY,"Oh, uh, nice to meet you. Where's Russell?"
S04E10,RITA,"He, uh, had to go to LA. There's a problem on the set of Blossom."
S04E10,JERRY,"Oh, poor Blossom. (He sits)"
S04E10,RITA,"Anyway, he asked me to sit in for him."
S04E10,MAN #2,Where's George?
S04E10,JERRY,"Oh, he ran to say something to David Letterman."
S04E10,SUSAN,David Letterman's on the floor?
S04E10,JERRY,"Yeah, he just walked by."
S04E10,RITA,"Well, I think we should get started anyway."
S04E10,JERRY,"Yeah, good idea."
S04E10,RITA,So how are you guys comin' along?
S04E10,JERRY,"Good, good, we've got a lot of ideas."
S04E10,RITA,Good. (Pause)
S04E10,JERRY,"Have you ever been to a Chinese restaurant and they tell you it'll be, like, five minutes for a table and you wind up waitin' there for, like, thirty minutes? Well, we thought it would be very funny to do an entire show where all you're doin' is waitin' for the table. (They don't seem to like it) Because we've all been in that situation. You know, you're waiting... and you're hungry... and you bump into somebody you know... When is Russell coming back?"
S04E10,RITA,So that's the idea?
S04E10,JERRY,"Well no, that's one. We have many others. We have an idea where, uh, I get into an accident with a guy who has no insurance and the judge sentences him to be my butler. (Everyone laughs) You know he cooks for me, he has to cook for me... He cleans my house, he's doin' my shopping, you know? I'm walkin' around with one of those big neck collars."
S04E10,MAN #2,Those collars are funny!
S04E10,MAN #1,Once you see someone in those collars you start laughing immediately. (George enters)
S04E10,GEORGE,"You tellin' 'em about the butler story? Is that beautiful or what? Hey, sorry I'm late. (Looks at Rita) Russell?"
S04E10,RITA,I'm Rita Kearson.
S04E10,GEORGE,"Oh, Rita. Hey, Mr. Shermack, how're you doing, good to see you. Jay, always a pleasure. (To Susan) Sweetie. (Kisses her and then sits down next to Jerry) Yeah, yeah, that butler idea, that's beautiful. Isn't that killer? (Aside to Jerry) I thought I was getting the butler."
S04E10,JERRY,"Don't worry, uh, we'll find something for you."
S04E10,JERRY,"So Letterman didn't spark to your idea, huh?"
S04E10,GEORGE,"No, he said there was nothing he could do, and next time I should probably break the Prozacs in half."
S04E10,KRAMER,"You, you guys wanna hold it down? I'm watchin' Jeopardy."
S04E10,JERRY,Would you give him the TV back?
S04E10,KRAMER,"Oh, by the way, George. Susan called for you a minute ago."
S04E10,GEORGE,I bet they're probably doing summersaults about us over there. You think they get butler stories like that everyday? (He calls Susan)
S04E10,KRAMER,(To the TV) Who is Joseph Cotton? Giddee up!
S04E10,SUSAN,Hello?
S04E10,GEORGE,"Hi, it's me. It's Georgie Boy. What's going on?"
S04E10,SUSAN,What's going on? What's going on? I'll tell you what's going on. I'm fired!
S04E10,GEORGE,Fired? Why?
S04E10,SUSAN,"Because you kissed me. You kissed me, you stupid idiot! Rita called Russell and he fired me over the phone."
S04E10,KRAMER,(To the TV) What is pi? Ooh! Giddee up again.
S04E10,GEORGE,But I had no... I didn't realize.
S04E10,SUSAN,"You didn't realize? How could you not realize? You're stupid! You're a stupid, stupid man!"
S04E10,GEORGE,I just feel terrible This is just terrible.
S04E10,KRAMER,"(To the TV once again) What is the cha-cha? Ooh, yes indeed."
S04E10,SUSAN,I'll speak to you later.
S04E10,GEORGE,"(Hangs up phone and pauses) this is great! He fired her! This is incredible, he fired her. I'm out, baby! I'm out!"
S04E10,JERRY,Why did he fire her?
S04E10,GEORGE,"Because I kissed her in the meeting. Russell found out, he fired her over the phone. Finally, my stupidity pays off!"
S04E10,KRAMER,"What is here comes the judge, here comes the judge!"
S04E10,JERRY,You can't break up with her now. Her life is shattered. You got her fired. You gotta be there for her.
S04E10,GEORGE,What?
S04E10,JERRY,You gotta at least wait until she gets another job.
S04E10,GEORGE,Another job?
S04E10,JERRY,Couple of interviews.
S04E10,GEORGE,"Oh, this is unbelievable. I'm stuck. Every time I think I'm out, they pull me back in."
S04E10,MARLA,"Are you gonna leave after its over? You know, if we have sex."
S04E10,JERRY,What? Leave? Where? Why?
S04E10,MARLA,"You know, the apartment."
S04E10,JERRY,Why would I leave? This is my apartment.
S04E10,MARLA,Well what if it was my apartment?
S04E10,JERRY,Who gave you this idea I would wanna leave?
S04E10,MARLA,Well Elaine said men like to leave after it's over.
S04E10,JERRY,"Listen, I wouldn't put too much stock into what Elaine has to say about relationships. She comes from a broken home, and I mean that literally. A tree fell on her roof and cracked the whole structure. Her parents got along beautifully, but her house was in bad shape."
S04E10,MARLA,Maybe I should get going.
S04E10,JERRY,What else did you say to her?
S04E10,ELAINE,Nothin'. I was just givin' her the straight dope.
S04E10,JERRY,"More like a dope was giving it to her straight. Another cup of coffee with you, she'll wind up in a convent."
S04E10,ELAINE,"Listen, there was a lot more I could've told her, believe me."
S04E10,JERRY,What is that about leaving after sex? Did I ever leave with you?
S04E10,ELAINE,You might've if I'd stayed. So you know what? I got served with papers today. Ping is suing me. I need your virgin as a witness. You better be nice to her.
S04E10,JERRY,I was trying to be.
S04E10,ELAINE,"Look at George. (On the other side of the restaurant) He lucked out, huh?"
S04E10,JERRY,"Oh, you're not kiddin'. Who'd 've figured Susan would break up with him? They had a good thing going."
S04E10,ELAINE,"Yeah, since she met him she's been vomited on, her family cabin's been burned down, she learned her father's a homosexual, and she got fired from a high paying network job. Yeah, they had a real good thing going."
S04E10,GEORGE,"What do I do? Well actually, I'm a writer. In fact, I'm writing a comedy pilot for NBC right now."
S04E10,WOMAN,"A sitcom? How can you write that crap? Carol, this guy's writing a sitcom."
S04E10,CAROL,"A sitcom? Come on, let's go. (They leave)"
S04E10,WOMAN,A sitcom. Can you imagine? And he actually tried to use it to hit on me!
S04E11,[Setting,Monk's Coffee shop]
S04E11,JERRY,(To Elaine) Let me ask you a question.
S04E11,ELAINE,Mm-hm.
S04E11,JERRY,"You're a hostage, captured by terrorists-"
S04E11,ELAINE,"(Smiling, chewing) Who, me?"
S04E11,JERRY,"You, anybody - whatever. You're in the little room, you're chained to the floor, you're there for a long time.. do you think they would ever consider doing the laundry?"
S04E11,ELAINE,"(Matter-of-factly) They have to, it's in the Geneva Convention."
S04E11,KRAMER,"(Imitating a Turkish terrorist) You! Take off your socks, your pants, your underwear. We're doing the wash. C'mon! Take it off, take it off!"
S04E11,KRAMER,"Hey, Georgie."
S04E11,JERRY AND ELAINE,Hi.
S04E11,JERRY,(To George) What's the matter?
S04E11,GEORGE,(Slowly shakes his head) My mother caught me.
S04E11,JERRY,"""Caught"" you? Doing what?"
S04E11,GEORGE,You know. (All three give him blank stares) I was alone..
S04E11,ELAINE,(Making a face of surprise) You mean..?!
S04E11,GEORGE,(Nods) Uh-huh.
S04E11,KRAMER,(Laughing) She caught you?
S04E11,JERRY,Where?
S04E11,GEORGE,"(Not really wanting to embellish) ..I stopped by the house to drop the car off, and I went inside for a few minutes.. Nobody was there - they're supposed to be working. (Jerry and Elaine look at each other - enjoying the story) My mother had a Glamour magazine, I started leafing through it.."
S04E11,JERRY,"""Glamour""?"
S04E11,GEORGE,"..So, one thing lead to another.."
S04E11,JERRY,"So, what did she do?"
S04E11,GEORGE,"First she screams, ""George, what are you doing?! My God!"" And it looked like she was gonna faint - she started clutching the wall, trying to hang onto it."
S04E11,KRMAER,(Reflecting on the story so far) Man..
S04E11,GEORGE,"I didn't know whether to try and keep her from falling, or zip up."
S04E11,JERRY,What did you do?
S04E11,GEORGE,I zipped up!
S04E11,ELAINE,"(Wide-eyed) So, she fell?"
S04E11,GEORGE,"Yeah. (Noticing this makes him out to be the bad kid, he gets defensive) Well, I couldn't run over there the way I was!"
S04E11,ELAINE,"No, I guess you couldn't have.."
S04E11,JERRY,"(In the middle of Elaine's sentence, smiling) No, I wouldn't think so."
S04E11,ELAINE,(Finishing it off) ..done that.
S04E11,GEORGE,"So, she fell, and then she started screaming, ""My back! My back!"" So, I picked her up and took her to the hospital."
S04E11,ELAINE,(Between chuckles) How is she?
S04E11,GEORGE,(Somewhat angered) She's in traction.
S04E11,ELAINE,"(Still laughing) Ok, I'm sorry."
S04E11,GEORGE,"It's not funny, Elaine."
S04E11,ELAINE,(Stifling her laughter) I know. I'm sorry. I'm serious.
S04E11,GEORGE,"Her back went out. She's gotta be there for a couple of days. All she said on the way over in the car was, ""Why, George, why?!"".. I said, ""Because it's there!"""
S04E11,JERRY,"""Glamour""?"
S04E11,GEORGE,"(Vowing) Well, I'll tell you this, though - I am never doing.. that , again."
S04E11,ELAINE,"What, you mean, in your mother's house, or all together?"
S04E11,GEORGE,(Definite) All together.
S04E11,ELAINE,"Oh, gimme a break.."
S04E11,JERRY,(Skeptical) Ohhh yeah.. right.
S04E11,KRAMER,"Oh, like you're gonna stop?"
S04E11,JERRY AND ELAINE,C'mon..
S04E11,GEORGE,You don't think I can?
S04E11,JERRY,No chance.
S04E11,GEORGE,(Daring) You think you could?
S04E11,JERRY,"Well, I know I could hold out longer than you."
S04E11,GEORGE,Care to make it interesting?
S04E11,JERRY,"Sure, how much?"
S04E11,GEORGE,A hundred dollars.
S04E11,JERRY,(Pointing) You're on.
S04E11,KRAMER,"(Butting in) Wait a second, wait a second. Count me in on this. (Clicks his tongue)"
S04E11,JERRY,You?
S04E11,KRAMER,Yeah.
S04E11,JERRY,You'll be out before we get the check.
S04E11,ELAINE,"(Smiling) I want to be in on this, too."
S04E11,GEORGE AND JERRY,"(Rejecting) Ohh, no. No, no, no.."
S04E11,ELAINE,Why?
S04E11,JERRY,(Showing difference) It's apples and oranges..
S04E11,ELAINE,"What? Why? (More 'no, no, no's from Jerry and George. Persistent) Why?"
S04E11,JERRY,Because you're a woman!
S04E11,ELAINE,So what?
S04E11,JERRY,It's easier for a woman not to do it than a man.
S04E11,ELAINE,(Sarcastic) Oh.
S04E11,JERRY,"We have to do it. It's part of our lifestyle. It's like, uh.. shaving."
S04E11,ELAINE,"Oh, that is such bologna. I shave my legs."
S04E11,KRAMER,(Making a point) Not everyday.
S04E11,GEORGE,"Alright, look, you want to be in?"
S04E11,ELAINE,Yeah!
S04E11,GEORGE,You gotta give us odds. At least two to one - you gotta put up two-hundred dollars.
S04E11,KRAMER,"No, a thousand!"
S04E11,ELAINE,"No, I'll - I'll put up one-fifty."
S04E11,GEORGE,"Alright, you're in for one-fifty."
S04E11,JERRY,"(Nodding) Okay, one-fifty."
S04E11,GEORGE,"Alright, now, how are we gonna monitor this thing?"
S04E11,JERRY,"Well, obviously, we all know each other very well, (Elaine slightly laughs) I'm sure that we'll all feel comfortable within the confines of the honor system."
S04E11,KRAMER,Alright. (Holds out his pinkie at the center of the table)
S04E11,[Setting,Jerry's apartment]
S04E11,GEORGE,"(Stern) No, ma, I'm not gonna see a psychiatrist. N- I don't care if you do pay for it! No! Discussion over. Yeah, alright, I'll see you later. Yes, of course I'm gonna come by. Alright. (Hangs up, slamming it down on the coffee table. He sits down next to Jerry) My mother wants me to see a psychiatrist now. Why?! Because she caught me? (Scoffs, shaking his head) You know, if everyone who did that had to go see a psychiatrist.. (Laughing, he snorts)"
S04E11,JERRY,(Waits for the rest of the sentence) ..Yeah?
S04E11,GEORGE,(Defensively) Whatever.
S04E11,JERRY,How is she?
S04E11,GEORGE,(Shrugging it off) She'll be fine. I gotta go to the hospital to see her tonight.
S04E11,JERRY,(Answering to the intercom) Yeah?
S04E11,ELAINE,It's me.
S04E11,JERRY,Come on up. (Lets her in by unlocking the front door)
S04E11,GEORGE,"Hey, what are you doing tonight?"
S04E11,JERRY,(Opens his door slightly for Elaine) Dating Marla.
S04E11,GEORGE,"Oh, the virgin?"
S04E11,JERRY,Yeah.
S04E11,GEORGE,"Any, uh.. progress, there? What's the latest?"
S04E11,JERRY,"Well, I got my troops amassed along the border - I'm just waiting for someone to give me the go-ahead."
S04E11,KRAMER,"Hey, look at this, c'mere. There's a naked woman across the street."
S04E11,JERRY,Where?
S04E11,KRAMER,Second floor from the top. (Pointing) See the window on the left?
S04E11,GEORGE,(In awe) Wow!
S04E11,JERRY,(Also amazed) Who walks around the house like that?!
S04E11,GEORGE,"(Suggesting) Maybe she's a nudist. You know, those nudist colony people.."
S04E11,KRAMER,"..Yeah.. (Pause) yeah.. (Slowly stands up, and walks out Jerry's apartment - leaving Jerry and George with the view, he shuts the door behind him)"
S04E11,JERRY,"Hey, let me ask you a question. In these nudist colonies, do they eat naked in the dining room?"
S04E11,GEORGE,I would imagine it's all naked.
S04E11,JERRY,"What about the chamber maids? Are they naked, too?"
S04E11,GEORGE,"(Still focused on the nudist) They're naked, the gardeners naked.. the bellhops. (Jerry makes a noise of astonishment) One big nude-a-rama."
S04E11,ELAINE,Hey.
S04E11,JERRY AND GEORGE,(Only turning back for a second) Hey.
S04E11,ELAINE,"Well, (Smiling) where's my money? Who caved?"
S04E11,JERRY,(Over his shoulder) Not me.
S04E11,GEORGE,"(Also, over his shoulder) Not me."
S04E11,ELAINE,What're you looking at?
S04E11,JERRY,There's a naked woman across the street.
S04E11,ELAINE,"(Smiling, chuckling) This is gonna be the easiest money I've ever made in my life. (Moving on to a new topic) So, my fried, Joyce, is teaching an aerobics class. I'm gonna go tonight."
S04E11,JERRY,(Commenting) Yeah.. the - the waitress should've taken it back.
S04E11,ELAINE,"(Realizes Jerry and George aren't paying attention) So then, I got a call this morning. You know, I was, uh, chosen to go on the space shuttle. We're goin' to Mars."
S04E11,JERRY,(Still staring at the woman) Uh-huh.
S04E11,GEORGE,Have a good time.
S04E11,KRAMER,(Declaring) I'm out!
S04E11,ELAINE,What?!
S04E11,KRAMER,"Yeah, I'm out - I'm out of the contest."
S04E11,GEORGE,You're out?!
S04E11,KRAMER,"Yeah, yeah.. (Notes their reactions) what?"
S04E11,ELAINE,"Well, that was fast!"
S04E11,JERRY,"Well, it was that woman across the street. (To Jerry) You know, you better be careful, buddy. She's gonna get you next. (Walks out, shutting the door behind him)"
S04E11,ELAINE,..And then there were three.
S04E11,[Setting,Hospital room]
S04E11,ESTELLE,"I don't understand you. I really don't. You have nothing better to do at three o' clock in the afternoon? I go out for a quart of milk, I come home, and find my son treating his body like it was an amusement park!"
S04E11,GEORGE,"(Stern, trying to shut her up) Ma."
S04E11,ESTELLE,"Don't give me ""Ma"". It's a good thing I didn't hit the table. I could of cracked my head open."
S04E11,GEORGE,"Ma, people can hear you."
S04E11,ESTELLE,(Heavy in sarcasm) Too bad you can't do that for a living. You'd be very successful at it. You could sell out Madison Square Garden. Thousands of people could watch you! You could be a big star!
S04E11,GEORGE,"(Getting up) Alright, Ma, that's enough!"
S04E11,ESTELLE,I want you to go see a psychiatrist.
S04E11,GEORGE,No! I am not going to see a psychiatrist!
S04E11,ESTELLE,Why? Why not?! Why won't you go?
S04E11,GEORGE,(Like a kid) Because I don't want to.
S04E11,ESTELLE,I want you to go see somebody.
S04E11,GEORGE,"Well, I am not going."
S04E11,ESTELLE,It's a good thing your father's in Chicago.
S04E11,SHELLY,"Hello, Aunt Estelle. Look at you - how did this happen?"
S04E11,GEORGE,"(Snapping) Is that important, really? What is this, a police investigation? The woman's been through enough. She has to relive the experience now?!"
S04E11,NURSE,"Hi, Denise. Six-thirty, time for your sponge bath."
S04E11,DENISE,Mmm.. is it six-thirty already? I fell asleep.
S04E11,SHELLY,"(Seems not to notice what's going on beyond the divider) So, George, what are you doing now? I hear you got some kinda television, writing - thing?"
S04E11,GEORGE,"(Slowly backing away, he's not at all committed to the conversation) Yeah.. television."
S04E11,NURSE,"Let me help you out with that. Here, just slip it over your head.."
S04E11,DENISE,Oh.. thank you.
S04E11,SHELLY,"(Nodding) Well, it's about time. We thought you were gonna wind up on the street. (As the bath is going on, George is now completely mesmerized) What is it you're doing, exactly?"
S04E11,ESTELLE,"George, you're cousin, Shelly, is talking to you!"
S04E11,[Setting,New York Health Club]
S04E11,JOYCE,"So, when was the last time you took a class?"
S04E11,ELAINE,"Oh, it's been a while."
S04E11,JOYCE,(Overly excited) Are you psyched?
S04E11,ELAINE,"(Fake excitement) Yeah. yeah, I'm really.. psyched."
S04E11,JOYCE,"Well, you're gonna thank me for getting you in here."
S04E11,ELAINE,Why is that?
S04E11,JOYCE,"(Pointing, she directs Elaine's attention off-camera) See the guy with the dark hair and the red shorts?"
S04E11,ELAINE,"(Between breaths) Oh, my God. (Joyce nods) John F. Kennedy Junior's here!"
S04E11,JOYCE,He's gonna be in your class today.
S04E11,ELAINE,(Still unable to speak right) In my class? John Kennedy's gonna be in my class?!
S04E11,JOYCE,I can get you a spot right behind him. He has got a great butt.
S04E11,ELAINE,Yeah. Butt. Butt. Great butt. John-John's butt.
S04E11,[Setting,Jerry's car]
S04E11,MARLA,Let's slow it down a little.
S04E11,JERRY,"""Slow it down""?"
S04E11,MARLA,"Well, (Reminding him of her virginity) You know.."
S04E11,JERRY,"Ah, yeah.. I know."
S04E11,MARLA,"You're okay with that, right?"
S04E11,JERRY,"Yeah, yeah.. of course. What, do you think I care about the sex? What kind of person do you think I am? That doesn't mean anything to me. (Faint) I don't care about that."
S04E11,MARLA,"So, I'll see you Saturday night, then?"
S04E11,JERRY,"(Smiling, nodding) Sure, Saturday night."
S04E11,MARLA,"Alright, then. Good night."
S04E11,JERRY,"Goodnight. (She gets out. Jerry leans forward, adding) Not just a good night - a great night. (She shuts the door, he waves)"
S04E11,[Setting,Jerry's bedroom]
S04E11,[Setting,Jerry's apartment]
S04E11,KRAMER,(Singing) Goood Moorrrnninng!
S04E11,JERRY,"(Out of it) Yeah, good morning."
S04E11,KRAMER,"Ha, ha! Nothing like some good solid sack time. (Turns toward Jerry's window)"
S04E11,JERRY,She's not there. She's doin' her wash.
S04E11,KRAMER,"(Turning back to Jerry) Oh. So, did you make it through the night?"
S04E11,JERRY,"(Over the top) Yes, I'm proud to say I did!"
S04E11,KRAMER,"So, you're still master of your domain."
S04E11,JERRY,"(Nodding) Yes. Yes I am. (Kramer chuckles) Master of my domain. But I will tell you this I am going over to (Gestures to the nudist) her apartment, and I'm tellin' her to put those shades down!"
S04E11,KRAMER,"Woah, woah, woah. What-what did you just say?"
S04E11,JERRY,"I can't take it anymore! She's driving me crazy! I can't sleep, I can't leave the house, and I' here, I'm climbin' the walls. Meanwhile, I'm dating a virgin, I'm in this contest - something's gotta give!"
S04E11,KRAMER,"Do you hear what you're saying?! Can you hear it?! (Jerry puts on his coat) This is a beautiful woman walking around naked, and you want to tell her to stop?! That's the dumbest thing I ever heard! I mean, think comprehens- I'm not gonna let you do it."
S04E11,JERRY,"(Persistent) Well, I'm doin' it, get out of my way."
S04E11,KRAMER,"(Stopping him) No, no, no, no. You can't! You can't! This is something that comes about once in a lifetime! When we were boys, looking through our bedroom windows, we would think ""Why can't there be a woman out there, taking her clothes off?"" And now that wish's come true, and you want to (Makes a noise) throw it away?!"
S04E11,JERRY,"Look, I'm sorry-"
S04E11,KRAMER,"No, I'm not gonna let you do it, Jerry."
S04E11,JERRY,"Kramer, (Trying to pass him) get outta my way!"
S04E11,KRAMER,"(Frantic) No, no, no. Don't do it. Don't do it! For my sake! God knows I don't ask you for much! (Pleading) Now, come on. Please, Jerry. Please! I'm beggin' ya! Please! (Claps hands) Come on! Please!"
S04E11,JERRY,Alright.. (Takes his coat off)
S04E11,KRAMER,Yes!
S04E11,JERRY,..Alright.
S04E11,KRAMER,"(Moving to the window) Thank you, thank you, thank you. (Sits in Jerry's chair, looking out the window)"
S04E11,JERRY,She's not there!
S04E11,KRAMER,"Oh, I can wait.."
S04E11,[Setting,Monk's Coffee shop]
S04E11,JERRY,So the nurse was giving her a sponge bath?
S04E11,GEORGE,"Every night at six-thirty. The nurse was gorgeous.. then I got a look at the patient.. (Laughs, then snorts) I was going nuts."
S04E11,JERRY,"Oh, man. Well, I guess you'll be going back to that hospital."
S04E11,GEORGE,"(Fake sympathy) Well, my mother, Jerry.."
S04E11,JERRY,(Pointing) But are you still master of your domain?
S04E11,GEORGE,(Arms out) I am king of the county. You?
S04E11,JERRY,Lord of the manor.
S04E11,ELAINE,John F. Kennedy Jun-ya!
S04E11,JERRY,What?
S04E11,ELAINE,(Smiling) He was in my aerobics class.
S04E11,JERRY,Really? Did you talk to him?
S04E11,ELAINE,"No, you don't understand - he was working out right in front of me. So, listen, after the class was over, I timed my walk to the door so we'd get there at the exact same moment, and he says to me, (Thinking the world of what he said) ""Quite a workout."""
S04E11,GEORGE,"""Quite a workout""? What did you say?"
S04E11,ELAINE,"(Smiling, proud) I said, ""yeah."""
S04E11,JERRY,"(Adding, fake praise) Good one."
S04E11,ELAINE,"So then, listen, listen. So then, I showered and I dressed, and I saw him again, on the way out. (Giddy and nearly out of breath) So we're walkin' and talkin', and he asked me my name - and I think I said Elaine - but, I mean, who the hell knows.. And so then, he says to me ""Do you wanna split a cab uptown?"" And I said, ""Sure"" - even though I was going downtown. So, we get in the cab, and I mean, I have no idea where I'm goin', right? But this is John F. Kennedy Junior we're talkin' about! (Deep breath) So, then, he says to me, ""Where do you live?"" And I - and I - and I was close to your block, so I said your building. So he dropped me off in front, (Laughs) and I had to take a cab all the way back downtown to my house.. (Picks up a glass of cold water and presses it up to her forehead to cool her off) Oh, God.."
S04E11,JERRY,"But the question is, are you still master of your domain?"
S04E11,ELAINE,(Sets the glass down) I'm queen of the castle. (Pops a piece of food into her mouth)
S04E11,[Setting,Estelle's hospital room]
S04E11,ESTELLE,You're back.
S04E11,GEORGE,"Of course I'm back. Why wouldn't I be back? My mother's in the hospital, I'm going to pay her a visit."
S04E11,ESTELLE,"I know, but two days in a row? You didn't have to do this."
S04E11,GEORGE,You're my mother! What wouldn't I do for you?
S04E11,ESTELLE,You know what you could do? I haven't eaten lunch or dinner. I can't eat this hospital food. Maybe you could run down to the deli and get me a sandwich..
S04E11,GEORGE,"(Smiling) You got it, Ma. (She smiles back, nodding) A little later. (George sits back in a nearby chair, looking at the divider in anticipation)"
S04E11,ESTELLE,"(Let down) Could you go now, George? I'm very hungry. I'm weak."
S04E11,GEORGE,"Well, wait a little while, Ma. What's the difference?"
S04E11,ESTELLE,I don't understand why you can't do this for me!
S04E11,GEORGE,"(Standing up) I just got here, Ma! I'd like to spend a little time with you."
S04E11,ESTELLE,"But if you wait, they won't let you back in! Visiting hours are almost over!"
S04E11,GEORGE,"Ten minutes! Here, here, (Fishes a box of Tic-Tacs out of his coat pocket and tosses them to her) Have some Tic-Tacs."
S04E11,ESTELLE,Get the hell outta here. (Angrily sets them aside) I'm sorry you came.
S04E11,NURSE,(To patient) Six-thirty. Time for your sponge bath.
S04E11,ESTELLE,George.. I'm huuunnnggry!
S04E11,GEORGE,"(Muttering, slow) Hang on, Ma.. hang on.."
S04E11,[Setting,New York Health Club]
S04E11,JOYCE,Hi!
S04E11,ELAINE,Hi.
S04E11,JOYCE,Did you get your hair done today?
S04E11,ELAINE,"No, I just, uh, fixed it.. a little bit. (Still looking around, she quickly checks her breath)"
S04E11,JOYCE,You know who - isn't here. He was in the early class today. (Elaine looses her composure) But I think you made quite an impression on him yesterday.
S04E11,ELAINE,(Regarding herself) What? What? Who? Me-me-me? I made an impression? What impression?
S04E11,JOYCE,Let me just put this back. (Turns to put a stack of shorts away)
S04E11,ELAINE,No! No! Now! Tell me now! What did he say?!
S04E11,JOYCE,(Uneasy) He asked about you.
S04E11,ELAINE,"(Ecstatic) He asked about me? John Kennedy asked about me?! (Hangs off the side of the counter, both feet in the air) What did he say?"
S04E11,JOYCE,He wanted to know your situation.
S04E11,ELAINE,(Quick) What situation? I have a situation?
S04E11,JOYCE,I-I told him you were single.
S04E11,ELAINE,That was good. That was very good.
S04E11,JOYCE,He said you were just his type.
S04E11,ELAINE,"(Frank) Okay, you tryin' to hurt me? Are you tryin' to hurt - you're tryin' to injure me, right? You're trying to hurt me."
S04E11,JOYCE,He also told me to tell you that he'll be in your neighborhood tomorrow around nine o' clock - so he's gonna stop in front of your building if you want to come down and say hello.
S04E11,[Setting,Jerry's apartment]
S04E11,JERRY,"Alright, Ma, I'll talk to you later.. Nothing, I'm, I'm watching, uh, Tiny Toons here, on Nickelodeon.. It's, I-I like kid shows. They have a very innocent, wholesome quality. Okay, alright, I'll talk to you later. Bye. (Hangs up)"
S04E11,KRAMER,"(Obviously watching the nudist across the street) Oh, that's good. That's good. That's very, very good. Oh, it's hot in there.. (Jerry looks back at Kramer in envy) It's hot in there. So, just walk around a little bit. Don't be ashamed, don't be ashamed.. that's good, that's good.. yes, yes, yes.."
S04E11,JERRY,"(Trying to block out Kramer, he starts to sing along with the TV) The wheels on the bus go round and round, round and round, round and round. The wheels on the bus.."
S04E11,KRAMER,"The woman across the street has nothing on, nothing on, nothing on.."

S04E11,[Setting,Jerry's apartment]
S04E11,GEORGE,All you got is instant coffee? Why don't you get some real coffee?
S04E11,JERRY,"I don't keep real coffee in here, I get my coffee on the outside! (Intercom buzzes. He answers it) Yeah?!"
S04E11,ELAINE,(Through intercom) It's Elaine.
S04E11,JERRY,(Shouting) Come on up! (Opens his door for Elaine)
S04E11,GEORGE,Where did you get those socks?
S04E11,JERRY,I don't know.
S04E11,GEORGE,I think those are my socks!
S04E11,JERRY,How are these your socks?!
S04E11,GEORGE,"I don't know, but those are my socks! I had a pair just like that with the blue stripe, and now I don't have them anymore!"
S04E11,JERRY,"(Sarcastic) Oh, yeah, that's right, well, you fell asleep one day on the sofa and I took them off your stinkin' feet. They looked so good to me, I just had to have them!"
S04E11,GEORGE,"Yeah, well, they're my socks!"
S04E11,JERRY,They're my socks!
S04E11,GEORGE,Oh boy..
S04E11,JERRY,What are we doing here..
S04E11,GEORGE,..Oh boy.
S04E11,JERRY,This is ridiculous.
S04E11,GEORGE,Do you believe this? We're fighting. We're fighting.
S04E11,JERRY,I haven't been myself lately. I've been snapping at everybody.
S04E11,GEORGE,Me too. I've been yelling at strangers on the street.
S04E11,ELAINE,"Hello.. (Pulls a wad of bills out of her purse, and starts to count it up)"
S04E11,GEORGE,(Shocked) You caved?!
S04E11,JERRY,It's over?
S04E11,GEORGE,You're out?
S04E11,JERRY,Ohh-my-God. The Queen is dead.
S04E11,GEORGE,I figured you'd cruise. At least through the Spring.
S04E11,JERRY,What happened?
S04E11,ELAINE,It was..uh.. John-John.
S04E11,JERRY AND GEORGE,Ohhhhh.. John-John.
S04E11,JERRY,But you made it through the day before.
S04E11,ELAINE,"Yeah, but yesterday, he told Joyce, the aerobics teacher, that he wants to meet me outside here at nine o' clock tonight."
S04E11,JERRY,Why outside here?
S04E11,ELAINE,"Because he think I live here. Remember when we shared a cab, and he dropped me off out in front? He's picking me up."
S04E11,JERRY,"Alright, Costanza - it's just you and me."
S04E11,GEORGE,"And then, (Smacks the money) there were two."
S04E11,ELAINE,(Slowly) Elaine Benes Kennedy Junior..
S04E11,[Setting,Jerry's apartment]
S04E11,MARLA,Let's go in the bedroom.
S04E11,JERRY,Really?
S04E11,MARLA,Yes.
S04E11,JERRY,You sure?
S04E11,MARLA,Yes.
S04E11,JERRY,You really want to?
S04E11,MARLA,I do. I'm ready.
S04E11,JERRY,Okay..
S04E11,MARLA,I know how difficult this must have been for you.
S04E11,JERRY,(Chuckles) You don't know the half of it.
S04E11,MARLA,What do you mean?
S04E11,JERRY,"Well, it's kinda silly, but.."
S04E11,MARLA,Contest?! A contest! This is what you do with your friends?
S04E11,JERRY,"No, it was just a bet. I mean, it actually started with George and his mother-"
S04E11,MARLA,I don't want to hear another word. And to think how close I came to you being the one! I must have been out of my mind.
S04E11,ELAINE,"Marla? Hi, oh, I'm glad I ran into you-"
S04E11,MARLA,"I don't want to have anything to do with you or your perverted friends. (Confused, Elaine moves closer) Ooohh, get away from me! You're horrible."
S04E11,[Setting,Jerry's apartment]
S04E11,ELAINE,What happened?
S04E11,JERRY,I told her about the contest.
S04E11,ELAINE,"Ohh. Boy, she's a whack-o."
S04E11,GEORGE,"(To Elaine) Hey, what happened?"
S04E11,ELAINE,What?
S04E11,GEORGE,I thought you were meeting Kennedy.
S04E11,ELAINE,(Let down) He didn't show.
S04E11,GEORGE,"Yeah, he did."
S04E11,ELAINE,"What? He's - He's out there? Oh, my God. I-I gotta go, I gotta go.."
S04E11,GEORGE,"No, no, no. He just left."
S04E11,ELAINE,What?
S04E11,GEORGE,"Yeah, he was talking to Marla."
S04E11,JERRY,Marla?
S04E11,GEORGE,"Yeah, I think, you know, she was, like, crying, and he was consoling her, and then, she, uh, just got into his car, and they just drove away."
S04E11,ELAINE,"(Angered) He left with Marla, the virgin?"
S04E11,GEORGE,Yeah.
S04E11,ELAINE,They drove away?
S04E11,GEORGE,"Yeah, drove away.. You know, I said 'Hello' to him. You know, he's - he's-"
S04E11,JERRY,"(Moving to the window, shocked) Oh my God in heaven!"
S04E11,ELAINE,(Makes a sound of surprise) Is that..?
S04E11,GEORGE,Kramer?!
S04E11,ELAINE,He's waving..
S04E11,[Setting,Elaine's bedroom]
S04E11,MARLA,"Ohh, John. That was wonderful.."
S04E12,ELAINE,"Bah bah baaah, Boo doo bah bah bah, boo doo waaaah, waah, waaaah..."
S04E12,JERRY,"Hey, could you do me a favour? [pause] Could you shut-up?"
S04E12,ELAINE,Hey guess what? This window doesn't work.
S04E12,JERRY,"I hate rental cars. Nothin' ever works the window doesn't work, the radio doesn't work... and it smells like a cheap hooker... [pause] Or is that you?"
S04E12,ELAINE,Gimme ten bucks and find out...
S04E12,JERRY,"So, this worked out pretty good. Them givin' me an extra ticket, y'know, you get a free trip to St. Louis, I did my gig, you got to see your sister..."
S04E12,ELAINE,"Yeah, worked out good."
S04E12,JERRY,And here's the beauty--
S04E12,ELAINE,What?
S04E12,JERRY,George is pickin' us up at the airport.
S04E12,ELAINE,Get out of here! Why?
S04E12,JERRY,You know that awning outside my building?
S04E12,ELAINE,Yeah...
S04E12,JERRY,"He's always bragging about his vertical leap, so I bet him fifty bucks that he couldn't touch the awning."
S04E12,ELAINE,So what happened?
S04E12,JERRY,"He didn't come within two feet of the thing. He's wavin at it... So, I told him if he picks us up at the airport, he wouldn't have to pay me anything."
S04E12,ELAINE,"Hey, how we doin' on time?"
S04E12,JERRY,"Timed out perfectly. Drop off the car, pick up the rental car shuttle, we walk right on the plane..."
S04E12,ELAINE,Hey! Wait up!
S04E12,JERRY,Hey! Wait up!
S04E12,DRIVER,Sorry. Heh heh heh...
S04E12,SKYCAP,Where you goin'?
S04E12,JERRY,"Uh, JFK. [To Elaine] I need some small bills for a tip. You got anything?"
S04E12,ELAINE,"Yeah, you want five?"
S04E12,JERRY,Gimme ten.
S04E12,ELAINE,You're giving him *ten* dollars?
S04E12,JERRY,"Well, we got three bags."
S04E12,ELAINE,That's a pretty big tip...
S04E12,JERRY,That's what they get!
S04E12,ELAINE,They don't get that much.
S04E12,JERRY,Let's ask him.
S04E12,ELAINE,We can't ask him...
S04E12,JERRY,Let's see what he says.
S04E12,ELAINE,"Jerry, we don't have time for this..."
S04E12,JERRY,"Two seconds. [To Skycap] Excuse me, my friend and I here, we were having a discussion and we were wondering what you usually get for a tip."
S04E12,SKYCAP,"Depends on the person, depends on the bag."
S04E12,JERRY,"Uh, how about a couple of people like us."
S04E12,SKYCAP,"People like you? I wouldn't expect much, you don't even look like you know what you're doing..."
S04E12,JERRY,"C'mon, seriously..."
S04E12,SKYCAP,"Well, since you asked, usually, I get five dollars a bag."
S04E12,ELAINE,What!?
S04E12,SKYCAP,That's right.
S04E12,ELAINE,*Five* dollars a bag? I don't think so.
S04E12,SKYCAP,"Look, you asked, I told you."
S04E12,ELAINE,You got some nerve trying to take advantage of us...
S04E12,JERRY,"All right, look, we're late. Thank you very much..."
S04E12,ELAINE,You're lucky I don't report you...
S04E12,SKYCAP,JFK...
S04E12,SKYCAP,...Honolulu.
S04E12,ELAINE,Wait up!
S04E12,JERRY,"You see? Never be late for a plane with a girl. 'Cuz a girl runs like a girl-- with the little steps and the arms flailing out... You wanna make this plane, you've gotta run like a man! Get your knees up!"
S04E12,JERRY & ELAINE,The flight's been canceled?!?!
S04E12,TICKET LADY,"Everything into JFK's booked... No, wait-- I have two seats into Laguardia-- but they're not together. It's boarding right now."
S04E12,JERRY,We'll take 'em!
S04E12,ELAINE,We're not going to sit together?
S04E12,JERRY,"Well, so what? It's not that long-- you'll read."
S04E12,ELAINE,"Well, what about George? He's supposed to pick us up at Kennedy."
S04E12,JERRY,We'll call him...
S04E12,ELAINE,There's no time.
S04E12,JERRY,No time? [To ticket lady] Is there time?
S04E12,TICKET LADY,There's no time.
S04E12,JERRY,"There's no time. All right, we'll call him from the plane."
S04E12,TICKET LADY,"I have one seat in first class, and one in coach. The price is the same since your flight was canceled."
S04E12,(The two have that uncomfortable politeness that only comes about when you're down to the last piece of pizza. Jerry breaks the silence,)
S04E12,JERRY,I'll take the first class.
S04E12,ELAINE,Jerry!
S04E12,JERRY,What?
S04E12,ELAINE,Why should you get the first class?
S04E12,JERRY,"Elaine, have you ever flown first class?"
S04E12,ELAINE,No.
S04E12,JERRY,"All right then. See? You won't know what you're missing. I've flown first class, Elaine-- I can't go back to coach. I can't... I won't..."
S04E12,ELAINE,You flew here coach.
S04E12,JERRY,"Yeah, that's a point..."
S04E12,ELAINE,"All right, fine. I don't care. If the plane crashes, everybody in first class is going to die, anyway."
S04E12,JERRY,"Yeah, I'm sure you'll live."
S04E12,ATTENDANT #1,Third row right...
S04E12,ATTENDANT #1,"Oh, you're in here, sir. Welcome aboard."
S04E12,JERRY,"Bon voyage, Lainey!"
S04E12,"(Elaine is robbed of her peek into the first class section by a drawn curtain and she goes to her seat. However, someone comes after her and",)
S04E12,PASSENGER #1,"Oh, excuse me... Um, excuse me, miss, I think you're sitting in my seat..."
S04E12,PASSENGER #1,I never check my bags-- I can't stand that wait in the baggage area.
S04E12,ELAINE,Great... [To herself] Help me...
S04E12,"(Jerry gets to his seat, however, he also is in the wrong seat",)
S04E12,TIA,"Excuse me, I think you're in my seat..."
S04E12,JERRY,"Oh, sorry... My mistake... [To himself] Thank... *you*!"
S04E12,GEORGE,"Hey, thanks for coming with me."
S04E12,KRAMER,"Hey, what made you think you could touch that awning?"
S04E12,GEORGE,I confused it with another awning.
S04E12,KRAMER,So how we doin' on time?
S04E12,GEORGE,"We're perfect. I timed this out so we would pull up at the terminal *exactly* 17 minutes after their flight is supposed to land. That gives them just enough time to get off the plane, pick up their bags and be walking *out* of the terminal as we roll up. I tell you, it's a thing of beauty. I can not express to you the feeling I get from a perfect airport pickup. (starts looking around) What's going on? What are you doing? The Long Island Expressway? What are you getting on the Long Island Expressway for? Do you know what the traffic will be like? This is a suicide mission!"
S04E12,KRAMER,Will you relax?!
S04E12,GEORGE,"Oh, I had it perfectly timed out the Grand Central, the Van Wyck! You destroyed my whole timing!"
S04E12,KRAMER,This is the best way to go!
S04E12,GEORGE,Do you know what happens if I miss him? I don't get credit for the pickup and I lose my 50 bucks...
S04E12,KRAMER,"George, there's no traffic at this time. Now, come on, man..."
S04E12,GEORGE,Really?
S04E12,KRAMER,"If anything, we'll probably get there early. I'll have a chance to go to the Duty Free shop."
S04E12,GEORGE,The Duty Free Shop? Duty Free is the biggest sucker deal in retail. Do you know how much duty is?
S04E12,KRAMER,Duty.
S04E12,GEORGE,"Yeah, ""duty"". Do you know how much duty is?"
S04E12,KRAMER,"No, I dunno how much duty is."
S04E12,GEORGE,Duty is *nothing*. It's like sales tax...
S04E12,KRAMER,I still like to stop at the duty free shop.
S04E12,GEORGE,I like to stop at the duty free shop.
S04E12,"(They start to ""sing"", growing more excited after each iteration",)
S04E12,GEORGE & KRAMER,I like to stop at the duty free shop!
S04E12,TIA,"So, he says, ``squeeze your breasts together'', and I say, ``I thought this was an ad for shoes''..."
S04E12,JERRY,Oh my...
S04E12,TIA,Is that the new Esquire? Turn to page 146.
S04E12,JERRY,Wow! Coming out of the shower... It's a good thing they gave you that washcloth to cover yourself up... What is this an ad for?
S04E12,TIA,"See those wrinkled jeans slung over the chair? Way in the background, out of focus?"
S04E12,JERRY,Uh-huh...
S04E12,KRAMER,How does it look on your side? [Pause while George just stares at him] We'll get there...
S04E12,ELAINE,"Oh, look at this... He's sleeping and I have to go to the bathroom. Maybe he'll wake up soon. What if my kidneys burst? Is it worth it not to wake this man up to damage a major organ? I hope this disgusting slob appreciates what I'm doing for him... [To passenger on the other side of her, but still to herself] Yeah, make a little more noise with your gum-- that's helpful."
S04E12,"[On the bright side, Kramer and George arrive at the airport. They're running to the terminal",
S04E12,GEORGE,They're not here! You cost me fifty bucks!
S04E12,KRAMER,Look at you! You run like a girl! Run like a man! Lift your knees!
S04E12,GEORGE,"Look, we're wasting our time here! We're a half-hour late, they've probably took it off the board already."
S04E12,KRAMER,"No, there it is, right there-- 133... and it's canceled."
S04E12,GEORGE,Canceled? Do I still get credit for the pick up? I was here!
S04E12,KRAMER,"Ok, c'mon... let's go check over at the ticket counter."
S04E12,GROSSBARD,"Oh, there it is honey, gate 18A, 830... [He leaves]"
S04E12,KRAMER,Did you see that guy?
S04E12,GEORGE,No... What guy?
S04E12,KRAMER,That guy.. He was just...
S04E12,GEORGE,"Listen, you go over to the ticket counter, I'm going to go stop in the gift shop and pick up a copy of Time magazine. There's supposed to ba blurb about Jerry in it and I think he mentioned my name!"
S04E12,KRAMER,[still lost] I know that guy...
S04E12,PRISONER,Gotta get my Time magazine... Never miss my Time magazine.
S04E12,GUARD,"Yeah, get your magazine and let's get out of here."
S04E12,PRISONER,"Hey, I was gonna take that!"
S04E12,GEORGE,"Gee, I'm sorry... I got here first."
S04E12,PRISONER,"I don't care when you got here, I want the magazine..."
S04E12,GEORGE,"You don't understand, there's a *blurb* about me in this magazine!"
S04E12,PRISONER,"A *blurb*?!? *You're* a blurb! Check out the cover, idiot!"
S04E12,GUARD,"All right, let's go..."
S04E12,PRISONER,I want the magazine!
S04E12,GEORGE,Umm... No.
S04E12,PRISONER,"You know what I would do to you, if I wasn't in these shackles..."
S04E12,GEORGE,"But you are Blanche... You *are* in the shackles. Oh, I can't wait to read my *Time* magazine! Laaaast copy, too. Maybe I'll read it tomorrow-- in the park! It's supposed to be a beeyootiful day! Have a nice life... sentence, that is!"
S04E12,KRAMER,"They're on a different flight. They're scheduled to land in a half hour, only at Laguardia."
S04E12,GEORGE,"Laguardia? All right, let's go. C'mon..."
S04E12,KRAMER,Where do I know that guy from?
S04E12,ELAINE,"[To herself, loudly] Wake up, you human slug! Wake up! *Wake* *up*!! I can't hold it anymore! [To the slug out loud] Excuse me, I've gotta go to the bathroom..."
S04E12,JERRY,Oh my... that *is* refreshing...
S04E12,ATTENDANT,Would you care for some slippers?
S04E12,JERRY,"Sounds lovely! [To Tia, motioning to put them on her] May I?"
S04E12,TIA,Please!
S04E12,JERRY,"Why, It's a perfect fit. You must be Cinderella."
S04E12,GEORGE,My name is not mentioned in this blurb...
S04E12,KRAMER,It's Grossbard!
S04E12,GEORGE,Who's Grossbard?
S04E12,KRAMER,"When I lived on Third avenue and 18th street 20 years ago, I had this roommate who was *always* behind in his rent. Then one month, he asks me to loan him his share of the rent-- 240 bucks! He took the cash and >pfffft< disappears. Well, I try to find him, I went to his girlfriend's house, even his family. Uh-uh. I never got the money back! He screwed me! And that's the guy-- John Grossbard!"
S04E12,GEORGE,"Hey Kramer, c'mon-- it was 240 bucks twenty years ago..."
S04E12,KRAMER,"No, I'm gonna turn around... I'm gonna get that guy..."
S04E12,GEORGE,"No-no-no, Kramer. Kramer! Kramer! You *cannot* abandon people in the middle of an airport pickup! It's a binding social contract. We... we must go forward... not back."
S04E12,"[Elaine is still waiting to get into the bathroom-- there's someone in there. *Finally*, a ZZ Top reject comes out of the bathroom and, to paraphrase Jerry in ""The Smelly Car""","``I open the door, like a *punch* in the *face*, the stench hits me--''. Elaine takes in a lungful of air and goes in. Brave little soldier.]"
S04E12,JERRY,"Tia, did you see all the flowers in that bathroom? It's like an English garden in there."
S04E12,ATTENDANT,"They're gardenias, mostly."
S04E12,JERRY,I thought I smelled lilac.
S04E12,ATTENDANT,"Yes, there are a few of those, too..."
S04E12,TIA,It's almost overwhelming...
S04E12,CAPTAIN,"Ladies and gentlemen, this is your captain speaking. Due to equipment problems at the runway at Laguardia, we've been instructed by the tower to re-route and land at JFK. We apologize for any inconvenience..."
S04E12,ELAINE,[To anyone who'll listen] What'd he say? What'd he say?
S04E12,GEORGE,"Well, You're not gonna believe it..."
S04E12,KRAMER,What?
S04E12,GEORGE,The plane's been re-routed *back* to Kennedy. We've got 45 minutes.
S04E12,KRAMER,"Let's go. Listen to the bell, Grossbard-- it tolls for thee."
S04E12,ATTENDANT,"We have some *delicious* Chateau Briande, my personal favourite. Or, if you prefer something lighter, a poached Dover sole in a delicate white wine sauce with just a *hint* of saffron."
S04E12,JERRY,"Oh, saffron! That sounds good."
S04E12,ATTENDANT,And today we're featuring wines from the *Tuscany* region...
S04E12,JERRY & TIA,Tuscany!
S04E12,ELAINE,Hi. Can I get to my seat?
S04E12,ATTENDANT,You're just gonna have to wait...
S04E12,ELAINE,But you just passed it. I'm sitting right there next to that guy...
S04E12,ATTENDANT,You're not supposed to get up during the food service.
S04E12,ELAINE,"Well, nobody *told* me that!"
S04E12,ATTENDANT,Look. This plane is *full*. I got a lot of people to serve. Now please... You're just gonna have to wait.
S04E12,GEORGE,There it is. Gate 46... We got plenty of time.
S04E12,KRAMER,Grossbard's plane leaves in ten minutes. I *still* got time to catch him!
S04E12,GEORGE,How you gonna catch him? He's probably boarded the plane already.
S04E12,KRAMER,Gimme your credit card.
S04E12,GEORGE,My credit card?
S04E12,KRAMER,"Just gimme the card, don't ask me any questions."
S04E12,GEORGE,I'm not gonna give you my card unless you tell me what it's for!
S04E12,KRAMER,I'm gonna buy a ticket-- I'm gonna get on that flight.
S04E12,GEORGE,"What, are you, nuts? You're gonna spend more on the ticket than you're gonna get back from Grossbard."
S04E12,KRAMER,"No, I'm not gonna use the ticket! I'm gonna get my money, I'll get off the plane and turn your ticket in for a refund. It's not gonna cost you a dime! Now gimme the card."
S04E12,GEORGE,This is a *great* idea! Here... use this one. I get frequent flyer miles with every purchase... Wait! Get two tickets. As long as your turning it in for a refund what's the difference? I'll get *double* the bonus miles.
S04E12,ELAINE,"Excuse me. I'm sorry to make you do this, but I got stuck in the aisle and the flight attendant wouldn't let me get through. There's no way to get around that cart..."
S04E12,PASSENGER #1,You're not supposed to get up during the food service.
S04E12,ELAINE,I'll try and remember that. [Pause] Where's my meal?
S04E12,PASSENGER #1,"He asked me where you were, and you were gone so long I thought you, uh, switched seats."
S04E12,ELAINE,"Excuse me? Excuse me, but I didn't get a meal."
S04E12,ATTENDANT,Are you sure?
S04E12,ELAINE,"Yes, I'm sure! I would know if a tray of food had been served to me."
S04E12,ATTENDANT,"Would you? Well, the only meal left is a kosher meal."
S04E12,ELAINE,Kosher meal? I don't want a kosher meal. I don't even know what a kosher meal is.
S04E12,PASSENGER #1,"I think it means when a Rabbi has inspected it, or something."
S04E12,PASSENGER #2,"No, no. It all has to do with the way they kill the pig."
S04E12,PASSENGER #1,They don't eat pigs!
S04E12,PASSENGER #2,They do if it's killed right-- under a Rabbi's supervision.
S04E12,PASSENGER #3,"Oh, You know what? *I* ordered the kosher meal."
S04E12,ELAINE,Then why didn't you take it?
S04E12,PASSENGER #3,"I ordered it six weeks ago, I forgot."
S04E12,ELAINE,You're eating my food!
S04E12,ATTENDANT,"Look, I got earplugs to collect. Do you want it, or not."
S04E12,JERRY & TIA,Mmmmmmmm!
S04E12,TIA,This is the best sundae I've ever had.
S04E12,JERRY,"Oh, man. You know what... they got the fudge on the bottom-- y'see? That enables you to control your fudge distribution as you're eatin' your ice cream."
S04E12,TIA,I've never met a man who knew so much about nothing.
S04E12,JERRY,Thank you...
S04E12,JERRY & TIA,Mmmmmm!
S04E12,ATTENDANT,More anything?
S04E12,JERRY,More everything!
S04E12,KRAMER,"Look, I got Super Savers! C'mon."
S04E12,GEORGE,Super Savers? Are they refundable!?
S04E12,GEORGE,"You bought non-refundable tickets, you idiot!"
S04E12,KRAMER,She talked me in to it-- she said it was the best deal.
S04E12,GEORGE,Do you know how much this is going to cost me?
S04E12,KRAMER,"Look, I'll tell you what-- I'll split it with you"
S04E12,GEORGE,"Look, I'm gonna go to the bathroom..."
S04E12,ATTENDANT,Excuse me... Excuuuse me...
S04E12,ELAINE,"What? Oh, no... nothing for me thanks."
S04E12,ATTENDANT,What is your name?
S04E12,ELAINE,Elaine Benes?
S04E12,ATTENDANT,[Checks her list] You're going to have to go back to coach.
S04E12,ELAINE,"No, but there was nobody sitting here..."
S04E12,ATTENDANT,"Yes, but you're still not allowed. These seats are very expensive."
S04E12,ELAINE,"Oh, no, please, don't send me back there. Please, I'll do anything. It's so nice up here. It's so comfortable up here. I don't want to go back there. Please don't send me back there... [She notices another attendant offering goods] Oh, you got *cookies*!"
S04E12,ATTENDANT,You're going to have to go back to your seat!
S04E12,ELAINE,"Ok, fine. I'll go back... You know, our goal should be a society *without* *classes*! [She goes through the curtain to, ick, *coach*] Do you realise that the people up here are getting *cookies*!"
S04E12,JERRY,"What is all the racket back there? You know, you're trying to relax on the plane and this is what you have to put up with. [To attendant] What is going on?"
S04E12,ATTENDANT,"Sir, this woman tried to *sneak* into first class."
S04E12,JERRY,"Oh, you see, that's terrible. The problem is, that curtain is no security-- there really should be a locking door."
S04E12,KRAMER,Hey! That guy owes me 240 bucks!
S04E12,JERRY,Couldn't be...
S04E12,JERRY,"Where are they already? I don't see them anywhere... I got my bags, I'm ready to go."
S04E12,ELAINE,"Yeah, *you* got *your* bags..."
S04E12,ELAINE,The worst flight I have been on in my entire life.
S04E12,JERRY,"Yeah, me too..."
S04E12,TIA,I'll call you.
S04E12,JERRY,Okay... [To a bamboozled Elaine] It's a business thing...
S04E12,KRAMER,You guys ready?
S04E12,JERRY,Yeah. Where's George?
S04E12,GEORGE,(can't be heard but looks like) Kramer!
S04E13,GEORGE,"I loved her Jerry, I loved her."
S04E13,JERRY,"No, you didn't."
S04E13,GEORGE,"And she loved me. Hoo, ho, she really did."
S04E13,JERRY,No she didn't.
S04E13,GEORGE,"What am I going to do now? I can't live without Susan. I gotta get her back. How? How, am I gonna get her back?"
S04E13,ELAINE,"[OC] Not only didn't you love her, you didn't even like her."
S04E13,GEORGE,Who says?
S04E13,ELAINE,You did.
S04E13,GEORGE,"Ah, ...A beautiful successful intelligent woman's in love with me and I throw it all away. uh oh boy. Now I'll spend the rest of my life living alone. I'll sit in my disgusting little apartment watching basketball games, eating Chinese take out. Walking around with no underwear. Because I'm too lazy to do a laundry."
S04E13,JERRY,You walk around with no underwear?
S04E13,GEORGE,"Yeah, what do you do when you run out of laundry?"
S04E13,JERRY,I do a wash.
S04E13,GEORGE,"Who am I going to meet who is better than her? No one, Jerry. No one's better than her."
S04E13,JERRY,When you were with her you said you couldn't stand her.
S04E13,GEORGE,I loved her!
S04E13,JERRY,You said goin up the steps of her apartment was like being taken to a cell.
S04E13,GEORGE,I would give anything to be going up those stairs again.
S04E13,GEORGE,I gotta call her. Should I call her?
S04E13,JERRY,"George, I don't know if that is such a good idea?"
S04E13,GEORGE,Whyie?
S04E13,JERRY,You need some professional advice. Why don't you go see Elaine's friend? She's a therapist.
S04E13,GEORGE,I'm not going to see that nut doctor she went to Europe with.
S04E13,JERRY,"No, no no [Elaine enters, flossing teeth] Elaine what's the name of that friend of yours ... that's a therapist ... the woman."
S04E13,ELAINE,Dana Folley.
S04E13,JERRY,"Right, Dana Folley."
S04E13,GEORGE,She any good?
S04E13,ELAINE,"Yeah, she's terrific. Why? You thinking of going?"
S04E13,GEORGE,"Wa, uh, ..."
S04E13,ELAINE,Tia? Who's that?
S04E13,JERRY,She's the model I met on the plane.
S04E13,ELAINE,She sent you a Christmas card?
S04E13,JERRY,Um uh. And we're going out Saturday night.
S04E13,GEORGE,My Darling Susan! My DARLING!!!
S04E13,JERRY,What are you doing?
S04E13,ELAINE,... date with Fred.
S04E13,JERRY,The religious guy?
S04E13,ELAINE,He's not THAT religious.
S04E13,JERRY,Let us pray.
S04E13,KRAMER,"Hey, you got any Double Crunch?"
S04E13,JERRY,Yeah.
S04E13,JERRY,"Kramer, should I call Susan?"
S04E13,KRAMER,Now what does the little man inside you say? See you gotta listen to the little man.
S04E13,GEORGE,My little man doesn't know.
S04E13,KRAMER,The little man knows all.
S04E13,GEORGE,My little man's an idiot.
S04E13,ELAINE,"See, she was clever. You know she put her picture on a card. I should do that. I never do anything like that."
S04E13,KRAMER,You want a picture like that on a Christmas card? I can do that for you. ...
S04E13,GEORGE,She kept such a nice clean apartment. She was so sanitary.
S04E13,ELAINE,"No, no, I was just thinking out loud I don't want my picture on a card."
S04E13,KRAMER,"No, no, I'll take your picture. I'll take care of everything."
S04E13,GEORGE,She made a big breakfast every Sunday. I don't know what she put in those eggs.
S04E13,KRAMER,"All right, ... now, you come on over. I'll have my cereal and I'll take your picture."
S04E13,ELAINE,Really? Can you really take a picture?
S04E13,JERRY,"Yeah, he's good. He takes good pictures. He's got equipment over there."
S04E13,ELAINE,"All right, ha ha"
S04E13,KRAMER,I don't know about that outfit though.
S04E13,ELAINE,Why? What's wrong with it?
S04E13,KRAMER,"Well, we'll have to improvise."
S04E13,GEORGE,"(singing) Oh hey, if you happen to see the most beautiful girl who walked out on me. Tell her I'm sorry. Tell her I need my baby ... oh won't you tell her ... I love her. Oh hey, ..."
S04E13,JERRY,George I'm afraid I'm going to have to ask you to leave.
S04E13,JERRY,"So, I'm thinking of putting in na tropical fish tank right here."
S04E13,TIA,Are you sure you're ready for that kind of comitment?
S04E13,JERRY,"Well, I figure if it doesn't work out I can always flush them down the toilet."
S04E13,TIA,That's horrible!
S04E13,JERRY,What's that perfume you're wearing?
S04E13,TIA,oh I completely forgot I want you to see this. The CALVIN KLEIN ad I was telling you about came out today.
S04E13,JERRY,What is that smell?
S04E13,TIA,It's here somewhere.
S04E13,JERRY,It smells like the beach.
S04E13,TIA,Exactly.
S04E13,JERRY,Oh my God is that the new perfume?
S04E13,TIA,Yeah.
S04E13,JERRY,I can't believe this. My next door neighbour had the idea for this exact perfume last year. He even met with an executive at CALVIN KLEIN. I can't believe they stole his idea.
S04E13,TIA,Are you sure?
S04E13,JERRY,And you're the model for this perfume?
S04E13,JERRY,"Uh, that's him. He just came home. ... Uh, the door [Jerry pushes his door against Kramer's entrance]"
S04E13,KRAMER,Hey
S04E13,JERRY,Hey.
S04E13,KRAMER,"Hey, how ya' doing? [Trying to enter]"
S04E13,JERRY,"Yeah, uh, I'll see you later."
S04E13,KRAMER,I just wanted to borrow your Dust Buster.
S04E13,JERRY,All right come on in. ... Just wait over HERE! Just wait here and I'll get it for you. ... Kramer this is Tia.
S04E13,KRAMER,Hello.
S04E13,KRAMER,How tall are you?
S04E13,TIA,Five ten.
S04E13,KRAMER,Come on lets see - Back to Back.
S04E13,JERRY,NO! Kramer!
S04E13,KRAMER,What's the matter with you? I just wanted to see how tall she was.
S04E13,JERRY,"Oh, you're tall - she's tall I'm tall. What's the difference who's tall. We're all tall."
S04E13,KRAMER,What's that?
S04E13,JERRY,What?
S04E13,KRAMER,That smell. What's that smell?
S04E13,JERRY,(starting the Dust Buster) What smell?
S04E13,KRAMER,It's very familiar. I can't put my finger on it. It's very familiar.
S04E13,JERRY,"Oh, they're all the same. Here. [gives him Dust Buster] Now if you'll excuse us, .."
S04E13,KRAMER,"Yeah, okay, So I'll see you tomorrow uh?"
S04E13,JERRY,Okay.
S04E13,KRAMER,Yeah. Nice meeting you.
S04E13,TIA,Nice meeting you too.
S04E13,JERRY,I'll see you later.
S04E13,JERRY,"Ooow, that was close."
S04E13,KRAMER,[OC] THE BEACH!!!
S04E13,KRAMER,You smell like the beach. What's the name of that perfume? you're wearing.
S04E13,TIA,It's Ocean by CALVIN KLEIN.
S04E13,KRAMER,"CALVIN KLEIN? No, no. That's my idea. They, they stole my idea. Y' see I had the idea of a cologne that makes you smell like you just came from the beach."
S04E13,JERRY,I know look at this [shows ad]
S04E13,KRAMER,"Whooo, ... That's you! What is going on here? The gyp(?) he laughs at me then he steals my idea. I could have been a millionaire. I could have been a fragrance millionaire, Jerry. ... They're not going to get away with this."
S04E13,DANA,"Hello. George, come in. Come in I've heard an awful lot about you. Please sit down."
S04E13,GEORGE,"Well hello. Um, ah, specifically the reason that I'm here, uh, I don't know uh what Elaine told you but uh I broke up with my girlfriend a couple of weeks ago. Actually she broke up with me [struggling with his coat zipper] and uh, well, I was the cause of it and uh, I just wanted to find out from you ... What's with this thing?"
S04E13,DANA,"So uh, she broke up with you? ..."
S04E13,GEORGE,"Yeah, and, ... Why won't this go down?"
S04E13,DANA,"It's all right don't worry about it. So, why did she break up with you?"
S04E13,GEORGE,What is with this damn zipper?
S04E13,DANA,It doesn't matter. You'll fix it later. Tell me about your girlfriend.
S04E13,GEORGE,It's stuck on a piece of cloth here. I can't get the cloth out.
S04E13,DANA,"It doesn't matter, so ..."
S04E13,GEORGE,"This is a brand new jacket. Boy this really burns me up, ..."
S04E13,DANA,"George, George, look at me. Okay, forget about the zipper. ... What's your girlfriend's name?"
S04E13,GEORGE,... Susan.
S04E13,DANA,"Okay, we're getting somewhere."
S04E13,GEORGE,"UH, ha ha, ... It's just SO frustrating. It's a brand new jacket."
S04E13,ELAINE,Anyway so Fred and I are going to do some volunteer work for that Church on Amsterdam.
S04E13,JERRY,"Oh, volunteer work!. See that's what I like about the holiday season. That's the true spirit of Christmas. People being helped by people other than me. That makes me feel good inside. Look at what we have here. (mail). A Christmas card from Laine. You didn't have to go to all that trouble."
S04E13,ELAINE,It was no trouble. My assistant did the whole thing.
S04E13,JERRY,I didn't even see the picture. How did it come out?
S04E13,ELAINE,"Well, you know. It's a picture?"
S04E13,JERRY,Oh yeah. Look at that. Looks good. Kramer did a good job.
S04E13,ELAINE,"Yeah, well. How hard is it to take a picture?"
S04E13,JERRY,... um ...
S04E13,ELAINE,What?
S04E13,JERRY,Did you look at look at this picture carefully?
S04E13,ELAINE,Carefully?
S04E13,JERRY,Because I'm not sure and and and correct me if I'm wrong but I think I see ... a nipple.
S04E13,ELAINE,What?
S04E13,JERRY,"Here. Take a look. What, what is that?"
S04E13,ELAINE,(gasps) Oh my God! That's my nipple.
S04E13,JERRY,That's what I thought.
S04E13,ELAINE,"That's my nipple. My nipple's exposed. I sent this card to hundreds of people! My parents. My boss. Uh, Nana and Papa."
S04E13,JERRY,DIDN'T YOU LOOK AT THE PICTURE?
S04E13,ELAINE,"Oh God I didn't notice. Oh, what am I going to do? You know your whole life you go through painstaking efforts to hide your nipple and then BOOM, suddenly hundreds of people get their own personal shot of it."
S04E13,KRAMER,Hey!
S04E13,ELAINE,Have you seen the card?
S04E13,KRAMER,What card?
S04E13,ELAINE,This car.
S04E13,KRAMER,"Yeah, yeah. Of course. I took it."
S04E13,ELAINE,Well did you notice anything unusual about it?
S04E13,KRAMER,No.
S04E13,ELAINE,Well come here and take a look.
S04E13,KRAMER,"Yeah, so?"
S04E13,ELAINE,"So, what's that?"
S04E13,KRAMER,That's a nipple.
S04E13,ELAINE,Right!!
S04E13,KRAMER,Ooo!
S04E13,ELAINE,"Aw, great!? Didn't you see that?"
S04E13,KRAMER,"Aw, no, no I didn't notice it. no, uh,"
S04E13,ELAINE,It's because you made me wear that stupid shirt.
S04E13,JERRY,"Well, maybe no one noticed it. You didn't notice it. Let me go get Newman. We'll see if he sees it."
S04E13,ELAINE,No. I don't want him looking.
S04E13,JERRY,Oh what's the difference. Everybody else you know has it.
S04E13,ELAINE,Oh my God. I sent one to the super in my building. My mailman. My ten year old little nephew. Sister Mary Catherine. Father Chelios. Oh my God Fred! I sent one to Fred.
S04E13,NEWMAN,Okay. What is it?
S04E13,JERRY,Take a look at this card. Tell me if you notice anything unusual about it.
S04E13,NEWMAN,Your nipple's showing.
S04E13,JERRY,Okay. Thanks.
S04E13,NEWMAN,Anything else?
S04E13,JERRY,No.
S04E13,NEWMAN,All right. See you later.
S04E13,JERRY,What? So what? It's a nipple. A little round circular protuberance. What's the big deal? See everybody's got them. See I got them.
S04E13,KRAMER,I got them too.
S04E13,JERRY,Everybody's got them.
S04E13,DANA,You see it's kind of got a little piece of cloth that's slipped underneath and it's ...
S04E13,GEORGE,Pull it up a little bit.
S04E13,DANA,"Uhg. Well you hold it. Wait, uh, Damn It! I can't move it. God, I've never seen a zipper so stubborn. DAMN IT! I almost had it."
S04E13,GEORGE,"Yeah, okey, wait wait. That will separate."
S04E13,DANA,No. Let me try...
S04E13,GEORGE,Take it right off the chest...
S04E13,DANA,"Ugh, .."
S04E13,GEORGE,You're gonna rip it. You're gonna rip it.
S04E13,DANA,YEAH!! UGH!!! ARG!!! ... I am afraid we're going to have to stop.
S04E13,GEORGE,"Okay. Uh, my mother is is going to pay for the sessions. ... Oh,Elaine?"
S04E13,DANA,Yeah.
S04E13,GEORGE,(stares at card)
S04E13,JERRY,"No, No, No, No, Oh, No."
S04E13,JERRY,Well every day for the past four days she hasn't returned one call.
S04E13,GEORGE,Was it a scratch or a pick?
S04E13,JERRY,It was a scratch.
S04E13,GEORGE,Hey. It's me.
S04E13,JERRY,Don't you think I know the difference between a pick and a scratch?
S04E13,JERRY,Yeah?
S04E13,ELAINE,(OC) It's me.
S04E13,JERRY,Come on up.
S04E13,GEORGE,Was there any nostril penetration?
S04E13,JERRY,There may have been some incidental penetration. But from her angle she was in no position to make the call.
S04E13,GEORGE,"So let's say in her mind she witnessed a pick. Okay, so then what?"
S04E13,JERRY,Is that so unforgivable? Is that like breaking a commandment? Did God say to Moses thou shalt not pick?
S04E13,GEORGE,I guarantee you that Moses was a picker. You wander throughh the desert for forty years with that dry air. ... You telling me you're not going to have occasion to clean house a little bit.
S04E13,JERRY,"Let me ask you something. If you were going out with somebody and if she did that what would, would you do? Would you continue going out with her?"
S04E13,GEORGE,No. That's disgusting!
S04E13,ELAINE,"You cannot believe what I'm going through. That card is plastered all over the office. Everybody is calling me, Nip! ... Yeah. That's my new nickname at the office. Nip! These guys keep asking me out for drinks. Not only that, Fred, you know the guy I told you about? He hasn't called me in three days. ... [sees card] Oh please!"
S04E13,GEORGE,"Hey. How come I didn't get a Christmas card? Everybody else got one. Jerry got one, Kramer got one. I thought we were good friends. I don't get a Christmas card. I don't get it."
S04E13,ELAINE,You want a Christmas card? You want a Christmas card? All right here. [rubs George's head on her breasts] Here's your Christmas card.
S04E13,KRAMER,Got any Double Crunch?
S04E13,JERRY,yeah. I think I do.
S04E13,KRAMER,What's that perfume?
S04E13,ELAINE,"What, Ocean."
S04E13,KRAMER,That's mine. That's my smell. Jerry you've got to get that model to get me an appointment with CALVIN KLEIN.
S04E13,JERRY,I can't She won't return my calls because she caught me in a pick at a light.
S04E13,KRAMER,I thought you said it was a scratch.
S04E13,JERRY,But that's not what she thinks.
S04E13,GEORGE,Why don't you call her agency. Maybe she's been out of town and she didn't get the calls.
S04E13,JERRY,"All right. I'll call the agency. [Elaine grabs card from George] Hello. Yes, I'm trying to get in touch with Tia Van Camp. Do you know if she's been in town? She's been in town. Oh really. well thank you very much. [hangs up] She has been in town. She's at CALVIN KLEIN's right now."
S04E13,KRAMER,Let's go.
S04E13,GEORGE,It'll be different this time.
S04E13,SUSAN,I need someone a little more stable.
S04E13,GEORGE,"I'm not stable? I'm like a rock. I take these glasses off, you can't tell the difference between me and a rock. I put these glasses on a rock. You know what jumps into most people's minds? Costanza!"
S04E13,SUSAN,People don't change.
S04E13,GEORGE,I change I change. Two weeks ago I tried a soft boiled egg. Never liked it before. Now I'm dunkin a piece of toast in there and I'm loving it.
S04E13,SUSAN,I'm not a soft boiled egg.
S04E13,GEORGE,And I am not a piece of toast.
S04E13,SUSAN,I just don't think we have anything in common.
S04E13,GEORGE,"That's okay. That's good. You think Louie Pasteur and his wife had anything in common? He was in the fields all day with the cows, you know with the milk, examining the milk, delving into milk, consummed with milk. Pasteurization, Homogenization, She was in the kitchen killing cockroaches with a boot on each hand."
S04E13,SUSAN,Why were there so many cockroaches?
S04E13,GEORGE,Because. There was a lot of cake lying around the house. Just sitting there going with all the excess milk from all the experiments [grins]
S04E13,SUSAN,And they got along?
S04E13,GEORGE,Yes! Yes. You know. She didn't know about Pasteurization. He didn't know anout Fumigation. But they made it work!
S04E13,KRAMER,I want to talk to Calvin.
S04E13,SECRETARY,You can't go in there.
S04E13,KRAMER,Let me talk to Calvin.
S04E13,TIA,Kramer?
S04E13,KRAMER,"Yeah, uh."
S04E13,CALVIN KLEIN,Who are you?
S04E13,KRAMER,I'm here to talk about the ocean.
S04E13,CALVIN KLEIN,"Oh, yes kramer. I uh, think I know something about this. Will you excuse us Tia? [Tia leaves]"
S04E13,KRAMER,Now I don't want any trouble Calvin.
S04E13,CALVIN KLEIN,Neither do I.
S04E13,JERRY,Hello there you are.
S04E13,TIA,What are you doing here?
S04E13,JERRY,"Well, I had to talk to you - I noticed you haven't been returning my calls."
S04E13,TIA,"Well, I've been busy."
S04E13,JERRY,"Because I - I thought we had a good time the other night, an' the only explanation I can come up with is that you think that you caught me (flustered, he indicates a nose pick)"
S04E13,TIA,(Waving him off) I'd rather not talk about this..
S04E13,JERRY,But I was clearly on the outer edge of the nostril.
S04E13,TIA,I know what I saw. (Turns toward the elevators)
S04E13,JERRY,But there - but there was no pick! I - I did not pick! There ws no piick!
S04E13,TIA,I gotta go. (Quickly walks away from Jerry)
S04E13,JERRY,No! No pick!

S04E13,KLEIN,(Reflecting on Kramer) Interesting face..
S04E13,KRAMER,"Yeah.. And, um, when I told him my idea about the beach cologne, you know, he - he laughed at me."
S04E13,KLEIN,"You're very lithe, aren't you? Very graceful."
S04E13,KRAMER,"Well, yeah."
S04E13,KLEIN,"Sit down, eh? (Kramer, misjudging one side of the couch, sits down uncomfortably) You're very lean, but muscular.."
S04E13,KRAMER,"You know, I try to take care of myself. I - I watch what I eat. Ah, just recently I cut out fructose."
S04E13,KLEIN,You're spectacular.
S04E13,KRAMER,(Flattered) Oh?
S04E13,[Setting,Elaine's office]
S04E13,ELAINE,"I told you, Fred - my friend's next door neighbor took it."
S04E13,FRED,(Incredulous) Soo - what happened?!
S04E13,ELAINE,"Well, I-I-I must a missed a button. I forgot to button it."
S04E13,FRED,I really don't see how you could miss a button like that.
S04E13,ELAINE,"Oh, you've never missed a button?! (Phone rings, she puts it on speakerphone) Yeah?.."
S04E13,RECEPTIONIST,"Your sister, Gail."
S04E13,ELAINE,"Oh, God - my nephew. (Picks up the phone and hits the button) Hi, Gail!.. Yu.. yu... Yes, Gail, I know how old he is."
S04E13,CO-WORKER,"(Pokes his head into the doorway) Hey, Nip, ya need that manuscript or can I take it home?"
S04E13,ELAINE,"Yeah, take it! Take it!.. An' stop calling me ""Nip""! (Co-worker takes it and quickly leaves. Elaine goes back to the phone) It was an accident! Well.. well.. it's gotta be somewhere. Look under his mattress."

S04E13,WOMAN,"About the focus group? I had nothing to do with the focus group. What's your point? (She sees Kramer emerge from another room. He's wearing only dress shoes, socks, and his briefs) My.. he's sexual, athletic.. an' without a trace of self-consciousness!"
S04E13,KLEIN,His buttocks are sublime!
S04E13,MAN,"Of course, his pectorals could use a little work - I suppose we could get him into the weight room."
S04E13,WOMAN,"(Mesmerized with Kramer's body) No, let's get him in the studio today. We can send these out immediately."
S04E13,MAN,"You've done it again, C.K.!"
S04E13,[Setting,Calvin Klein office building]
S04E13,JERRY,"An' what if I did do it? Even though I admit to nothing, and never will. What does that make me? And I'm not here just defending myself but all those Pickers out there who've been caught. (Elevator doors open) Each an' every one of them, who has to suffer the shame and humiliation because of people like you.. (Everyone but Jerry is now in the elevator. Jerry's still addressing them) Are we not human?! If we pick, do we not bleed?! (Elevator doors shut. A few people in the hallway are looking at him, he turns and addresses them) I am not an animal!"
S04E13,[Setting,Elaine's office]
S04E13,ELAINE,"I did not bare myself deliberately, but I tell you, I wish now that I had! (Fred, shocked by her speech, flees. She calls after him, still standing at the hallway) Because it is not me that has been exposed, but you! For I have seen the nipple on your soul!"
S04E13,GX,So the minute I started up the steps to her apartment I knew I made a terrible mistake. Going back with her. So we're in her apartment she goes into the bathroom. I'm cursing myself; now how do I get out of this? Then it hits me like a bolt of lightening. The pick.
S04E13,JERRY,The pick?
S04E13,ELAINE,The pick?
S04E13,GEORGE,"She comes out of the bathroom, I'm in up to my wrist. You should have seen the look on her face."
S04E13,JERRY,I think I've seen that look.
S04E13,KRAMER,I've got the magazine. The underwear ad came out.
S04E13,JERRY,"Boy, they really worked on your pectorals."
S04E13,GEORGE,Your buttocks are spectacular.

S04E14,JERRY,"You don't understand. I got this all timed out. I got another spot across town at 950, I'm not gonna be able to make it!"
S04E14,KERNIS,"I hear you, guy."
S04E14,JERRY,"And I'm doin' Letterman Monday. You know, I gotta work out the material!"
S04E14,% In the background is the plot complication of the week,Buckles. The manager assures Jerry that Buckles isn't on the menu. He just hangs around hoping that somebody drops out.
S04E14,KERNIS,Why don't you come back and do the 11 o'clock spot?
S04E14,JERRY,"No, I'm supposed to meet my friends to see this movie ``CheckMate'' at 1030."
S04E14,BUCKLES,"Hey, Jer!"
S04E14,JERRY,[not losing a step] Heeeeyyyyyyyy..... [and out the door]
S04E14,GEORGE,"Excuse me, do you have a ticket?"
S04E14,MAN,No.
S04E14,GEORGE,Okay. Good.
S04E14,% Misunderstanding number one,"When Jerry shows up at the other comedy place, the manager tells him his spot was for 915, not 950. The manager had no choice but to give Jerry's spot to..."
S04E14,BUCKLES,Jerry!
S04E14,JERRY,What are <you> doing here?
S04E14,BUCKLES,"Hey, do you think this is funny? ``Why do they call it athlete's foot? You don't have to be an athlete to get it. I mean, my father gets it all the time, and believe me, he's no athlete!''"
S04E14,ELAINE,I've been *dying* to see ``CheckMate''.
S04E14,GEORGE,"Well, if it's as good as ``Ponce de Leon'', I'll be happy."
S04E14,ELAINE,"``Ponce de Leon'', are you kidding me? I hated that movie!"
S04E14,GEORGE,``Ponce de Leon''? But that was great!
S04E14,ELAINE,"Oh, <come on>. That Fountain of Youth scene at the end, where they're all splashin' around, and then they go running over to the mirror to see if it really worked? I mean, come on! [laughing too hard to continue] That's stupid!"
S04E14,GEORGE,"Lemme tell you sum'in. When Ponce looked in that mirror and saw that he hadn't changed, and that tear started to roll down his cheek? ... I lost it."
S04E14,"% Apparently, a movie that can be interpreted on two levels. Misunderstanding number two",Kramer joins George and Elaine after looking for them at the Paradise Twin around the corner. Elaine hates the Paradise because it's a multiplex; she'd rather see a movie on a big screen. Something catches Kramer's eye.

S04E14,GEORGE & ELAINE,"No, wait!"
S04E14,GEORGE,You're not going to get back here in time!
S04E14,KRAMER,"I'm starvin', I haven't had any dinner!"
S04E14,ELAINE,You can get a hot dog in the theater.
S04E14,KRAMER,I don't wanna get a movie hot dog! [in tears] I want a Papaya King hot dog!
S04E14,ELAINE,"Kramer, Jerry is going to be here any second, and then this line is going to start moving, and we're going to end up in the front row."
S04E14,KRAMER,"Well, just save me a seat."
S04E14,ELAINE,No! I don't want to save seats. Don't put me through that! I once had the fleece just ripped out of my winter coat in a seat-saving incident!
S04E14,GEORGE,I'm in line to buy.
S04E14,ELAINE,"No, George, this is the ticket-<holders> line."
S04E14,GEORGE,"No it's not, it's the ticket-<buyers> line."
S04E14,ELAINE,Then how come we're not moving?
S04E14,KRAMER,Good question.
S04E14,GEORGE,"Is this the ticket holders line, or the buyers?"
S04E14,MAN,Holders.
S04E14,GEORGE,"But I asked you before if you had a ticket, and you said no!"
S04E14,MAN,I didn't. My friend was getting it.
S04E14,GEORGE,[furious] Good. It's good to be accurate like that.
S04E14,ELAINE,Can you believe him?
S04E14,KRAMER,He's spaced out.
S04E14,ELAINE,How long would *you* have stood in the ticket-holders line?

S04E14,ELAINE,"[gives up] Yeah, exactly..."

S04E14,ELAINE,I don't wanna go to a... miniplex multi-theater!
S04E14,GEORGE,It's the same movie! What's the difference?
S04E14,ELAINE,"It's not a theater, it's like a room where they bring in POWs to show them propaganda films."
S04E14,JERRY,[to taxi driver] Take the Park!
S04E14,BUCKLES,"No no no, take 55th."
S04E14,BUCKLES,"Jerry, I want you to do me a favor. No more fish!"
S04E14,JERRY,"[rubbing his eyes hoping the nightmare will end] Okay, I get your point!"
S04E14,BUCKLES,I had a point?
S04E14,GEORGE,"Hey, you know what else is playing here? ``Rochelle Rochelle''."
S04E14,ELAINE,Sigh/Ugh.
S04E14,GEORGE,I wouldn't mind seein' <that>.
S04E14,ELAINE,"Yeah. You know, men can sit through the most boring movie if there's even the slightest possibility that a woman will take her top off."
S04E14,GEORGE,So what's your point?
S04E14,GEORGE,"By the way, you owe me seven fifty."
S04E14,ELAINE,"Oh, all right. Can you break a twenty?"
S04E14,GEORGE,"No, I don't have any change."
S04E14,ELAINE,"Oh, well, then I'll pay you later."
S04E14,GEORGE,"Or, I could take the twenty, then I could pay *you* later."
S04E14,ELAINE,"Yeah, you *could*..."
S04E14,GEORGE,Might be easier.
S04E14,ELAINE,"I mean, how is that easier? I mean, then you would owe me twelve fifty instead of me owing you seven fifty."
S04E14,GEORGE,"[trying to act as if he doesn't care one way or the other, but we know better] Either way."
S04E14,ELAINE,Yeah.
S04E14,GEORGE,So... Can I have it?
S04E14,ELAINE,"I tell you what, I'll get the popcorn and the soda."
S04E14,GEORGE,"Whaddya mean, you'll ``get'' the popcorn and the soda?"
S04E14,ELAINE,I will buy your popcorn and soda. We'll call it even.

S04E14,ELAINE,"[exasperated] George, you're sappin' my strength."
S04E14,GEORGE,You go in and save seats.
S04E14,ELAINE,[in a panic] Me!? But that's three seats! I can't save three seats! I told you about that guy who tore up my winter coat!

S04E14,ELAINE,"No, these are saved."
S04E14,MAN,"All of them? C'mon, you can't take *four* seats."
S04E14,ELAINE,"What, is that a rule?"
S04E14,GEORGE,"Well, why don't *you* go, and I could save the seats. You said you didn't like saving anyway."
S04E14,ELAINE,"[stopping someone from sitting in the seat next to her] No, *TAKEN*, Taken, taken. [to George] [shrugs] I'm getting the hang of it."
S04E14,GEORGE,"Why don't you give me the twenty, and I'll stop and get change, and then you and I can... uh... you-know, settle."
S04E14,ELAINE,"Can we do this later, George?"
S04E14,GEORGE,"Psh. What's the point of even discussing it? [condescendingly takes her hand and pats it] You'll give me the money when you have it. [takes two steps, then reconsiders, then re-reconsiders] I, I trust you."

S04E14,ELAINE,What is that stain [on my coat]?
S04E14,KRAMER,It's yellow mustard. [To George] Can you break a twenty?
S04E14,"I always get confused in the movie theater by the, by the plot. It's embarrassing. It's an embarrassment to have to admit, but I'm the one that you see in the parking lot after the movie talking with his friends, going","``Oh, you mean that was the same guy from the <beginning>... Ohhhhhhhhhh...'' Nobody will explain it to you. When you're in the theater, you can't find out. [whispering to imaginary friends seated around him] ``Why did they kill that guy?... Why did they kill him?... Who was that guy? What was the... I thought he was with them? Wasn't he with them? Why would they kill him if he was with them? Oh, he wasn't *really* with them.... I thought he was with them. It's a good thing they killed him.''"
S04E15,GEORGE,So you're a lawyer. What kind of cases do you handle?
S04E15,CHERYL,"Oh, everything. Divorce, patents, immigration and naturalization."
S04E15,GEORGE,"What is that, immigrants come over, you show them how to act natural?"
S04E15,GEORGE,"No, they're not funny at all. No, I have no funny friends. I'm the funny one. El Clowno."
S04E15,ELAINE,"Look, I was nice enough to pick it up for you"
S04E15,JERRY,"Hey, I've been back four days, I want my mail."
S04E15,ELAINE,"It's mostly bills, magazines and junk mail anyway."
S04E15,JERRY,"Elaine, that's what mail is. Without bills, magazines and junk mail, there is no mail."
S04E15,CHERYL,Here's my card.
S04E15,GEORGE,"Oh, ok. Thank you. It was good talking to you."
S04E15,CHERYL,Nice meeting you.
S04E15,GEORGE,Yeah.
S04E15,ELAINE,Hi!
S04E15,JERRY,"Hey, how ya doin?"
S04E15,GEORGE,You would not believe what just happened. I was waiting for you and this woman was sitting at the counter.
S04E15,ELAINE,"What, the one who just left?"
S04E15,GEORGE,"Yeah, yeah, and we started talking, and she's this lawyer who's incredible! Everything I said was funny! You know, she laughed at everything I said, she thinks I'm hilarious. You know in a way, it was almost too good. I started so good, I can't go any place but down now, ya know? I got no place to go."
S04E15,ELAINE,"Yeah, well, I guess it's all over."
S04E15,JERRY,"(looking behind the counter) Hey, is that Babu? It is! (walking over) Hey, Babu!"
S04E15,BABU,Jerry!
S04E15,JERRY,"Look at you, you got the job."
S04E15,BABU,"Yes, yes, they give me job thanks to you."
S04E15,JERRY,"Oh, I didn't do anything."
S04E15,BABU,"Yes, you do everything, get me job, you get me a place to live in your building."
S04E15,JERRY,Come on.
S04E15,BABU,"You very very good man, you do everything for me. My family and I can never thank you enough for everything you do."
S04E15,GEORGE,"You see, this is what I do with women. I start out too strong, now I have to become real, that's when it all falls apart. What good is real? They don't want real, they want funny."
S04E15,ELAINE,No they don't.
S04E15,GEORGE,"Ooooh, yes they do."
S04E15,ELAINE,Nooo.
S04E15,GEORGE,"Ya gotta put on a show, ya always gotta give them a big show. You always have to be 'on' otherwise why would they like me? They'd just go for a better looking guy with more money."
S04E15,GEORGE,"You mean that's true, I'm right?!"
S04E15,JERRY,"Ok, great, well, I'm glad everything worked out, Babu."
S04E15,BABU,"Oh, yes, yes, everything wonderful."
S04E15,JERRY,"Ok, I'll see you around the building."
S04E15,BABU,I'll see you *in* the building.
S04E15,JERRY,(returning to the table) Remember Babu Bhatt?
S04E15,GEORGE,Who's he?
S04E15,JERRY,"Remember that guy who opened the restaurant across the street from the building last year and he wasn't doing so well and I told him he should make it into all Pakistani and that drove him right out of business? So, you uh, going with me to the auto show with me Saturday?"
S04E15,ELAINE,"Yeah, yeah."
S04E15,JERRY,Can you bring my mail then?
S04E15,GEORGE,What mail?
S04E15,ELAINE,I picked up his mail while he was on the road
S04E15,GEORGE,Why didn't Kramer pick it up?
S04E15,JERRY,Cause he's at that baseball fantasy camp in Florida.
S04E15,GEORGE,"Oh yeah, right. When's he coming back?"
S04E15,JERRY,"Monday, I think."
S04E15,GEORGE,"Kramer goes to a fantasy camp. His whole life is a fantasy camp. People should plunk down two-thousand dollars to live like him for a week. Do nothing, fall ass-backwards into money, mooch food off your neighbors and have sex without dating; that's a fantasy camp."
S04E15,JERRY,"Hey listen, if you're gonna go out with this lawyer, why don't you have dinner with us and then maybe you can go to the auto show with her if you want, you know, have a little company, take the pressure off."
S04E15,JERRY,...he never heard of corduroy!
S04E15,CHERYL,"(howling with laughter) Stop it, you're killing me!!"
S04E15,JERRY,"He never heard of corduroy! True story, true story."
S04E15,GEORGE,"No, no I don't think so."
S04E15,ELAINE,Why?
S04E15,GEORGE,Well I think I'm better off going one-on-one.
S04E15,JERRY,I don't know why you want to play man-to-man when you could play a zone.
S04E15,GEORGE,She might not be comfortable.
S04E15,ELAINE,"Why? We're all very nice, we're very friendly."
S04E15,JERRY,We'll be funny.
S04E15,GEORGE,"No! No. It's not good, I don't think so."
S04E15,ELAINE,"Alright, well if you change your mind, we'll wind up as Isabella's probably around seven."
S04E15,JERRY,"No, no Isabella's, I don't want to go to Isabella's."
S04E15,ELAINE,Why?
S04E15,JERRY,"No, it's too trendy, no Isabella's."
S04E15,GEORGE,(tasting the wine) Excellent. Like I really know what I'm talking about.
S04E15,GEORGE,"Toasting makes me uncomfortable. But toast, I love. Never start the day without a good piece of toast. In fact, let's toast to toast."
S04E15,JERRY,Look who's here! Georgie-boy!
S04E15,GEORGE,What are you doing here? I thought you said you hated Isabella's?
S04E15,ELAINE,"No, I talked him into it."
S04E15,GEORGE,What happened to the auto show?
S04E15,JERRY,"Oh, we're still going, we're still going. Elaine, do the spokes model."
S04E15,ELAINE,The turbo quadramatic transmission offers you the power and prestige to propel you well into the 21st century.
S04E15,GEORGE,"Cheryl, Elaine, and uh, Jerry."
S04E15,CHERYL,Would you like to join us?
S04E15,GEORGE,"Oh no no no, they don't want to join us."
S04E15,CHERYL,"Oh no, it's ok, don't be silly."
S04E15,ELAINE,"Ok, well why don't we just put these two tables together?"
S04E15,GEORGE,"(as the others are repositioning the tables) No, no, you can't do that, they're round, it makes an 'eight' and, yeah, well alright."
S04E15,ELAINE,"Jerry? Jerry, tell them that funny story you were telling me--"
S04E15,GEORGE,No! No.
S04E15,ELAINE,"No George, it's so funny. We saw this cab driver's picture, right?"
S04E15,GEORGE,"(interrupting) You know we should really order, the service is so slow here, by the time you get anything..."
S04E15,ELAINE,"Oh, Cheryl, can I ask you a legal question? Um, I'm being sued."
S04E15,CHERYL,Oh? What happened?
S04E15,ELAINE,"Well, I ran out to apologize to a virgin and I crossed against the light and I knocked over the delivery boy."
S04E15,CHERYL,Was he Chinese?
S04E15,ELAINE,Yeah.
S04E15,CHERYL,Is your last name Benes?
S04E15,JERRY,How did you know?
S04E15,CHERYL,Ping is my cousin!
S04E15,ELAINE,No!
S04E15,JERRY,That's so funny!
S04E15,CHERYL,I'm handling his case!
S04E15,ELAINE,What? You're Cheryl Fong?
S04E15,CHERYL,That's right!
S04E15,ELAINE,"Oh my god, I can't believe it! That is such a coincidence!"
S04E15,CHERYL,"Yeah, I know!"
S04E15,ELAINE,"Wow, well, I guess you don't have any advice for me on how to win the case?"
S04E15,CHERYL,Will you excuse me? I have to make a call.
S04E15,ELAINE,Tell Ping I said hello.
S04E15,JERRY,Tell him you think you may have broken the case wide open.
S04E15,JERRY,What?
S04E15,GEORGE,This is not good. This is not good.
S04E15,JERRY,What's the matter?
S04E15,GEORGE,I just don't think it's such a great idea for you to sit here.
S04E15,JERRY,Why not?
S04E15,ELAINE,"He thinks that if you're too funny, he might not look so funny."
S04E15,JERRY,Biff?
S04E15,GEORGE,What?
S04E15,JERRY,You're not worried about that?
S04E15,GEORGE,"No, of course not."
S04E15,JERRY,"I mean, so what if I'm funny? Who cares?"
S04E15,ELAINE,"He thinks that if a woman sees a guy put on a better show, she'll walk out on his show, go see the other show."
S04E15,JERRY,"Well, should we leave?"
S04E15,GEORGE,"Maybe you don't have to be so funny. I mean, would it kill you not to be so funny all the time? That's all I'm asking. This woman thinks I'm very funny. Now you're gonna be funny, so what am I gonna be? I'm gonna be a short bald guy with glasses who suddenly doesn't seem so funny."
S04E15,ELAINE,This is so ridiculous. Can we just go over there?
S04E15,JERRY,"I don't have to be funny, I don't care."
S04E15,GEORGE,You don't?
S04E15,JERRY,No way! It's completely under my control.
S04E15,ELAINE,"No, it's not. You cannot not be funny."
S04E15,JERRY,"Of course I can, am I being funny now?"
S04E15,ELAINE,A little.
S04E15,JERRY,"Oh, this is funny? I'm being funny?"
S04E15,ELAINE,Yeah.
S04E15,JERRY,"George, is this funny?"
S04E15,GEORGE,It's funny! (To Elaine) and it wouldn't kill you to not be so funny either.
S04E15,ELAINE,What? What did I do?
S04E15,GEORGE,Hi.
S04E15,JERRY,"(subdued, almost somber) Hello. Welcome back."
S04E15,CHERYL,"Sorry, it was my aunt's birthday and she makes such a big deal about it."
S04E15,ELAINE,"Well, nobody likes to get old, right?"
S04E15,JERRY,"Well, birthdays are merely symbolic of how another year has gone by and how little we've grown. No matter how desperate we are that someday a better self will emerge, with each flicker of the candles on the cake, we know it's not to be, that for the rest of our sad, wretched pathetic lives, this is who we are to the bitter end. Inevitably, irrevocably; happy birthday? No such thing."
S04E15,GEORGE,"Funny guy, huh?"
S04E15,ELAINE,"Here, take it. I was glad to get rid of it."
S04E15,JERRY,"Well thank you very much, it's about time."
S04E15,ELAINE,"Oh listen, guess what? Cheryl convinced Ping to drop the case against me."
S04E15,JERRY,"Drop the case? Well, congratulations, that'll save you some money."
S04E15,ELAINE,"Yeah, no kidding. That lawyer was gonna charge me a fortune."
S04E15,JERRY,"(leafing through his mail) Oh great, a birth announcement from Arnie and Joy Harris."
S04E15,JERRY,Hear that? Guess who's back. (Opening the door) Hey!
S04E15,KRAMER,Hey.
S04E15,JERRY,I thought you weren't coming back till Monday.
S04E15,KRAMER,"Well, the camp ended a few days early."
S04E15,JERRY,Why?
S04E15,KRAMER,"Uh, well there was an incident."
S04E15,JERRY,What happened?
S04E15,KRAMER,I punched Mickey Mantle in the mouth.
S04E15,JERRY,What?
S04E15,KRAMER,"Yeah, I punched him and they took him to the hospital and then they canceled the rest of the week."
S04E15,ELAINE,You punched who in the mouth?
S04E15,KRAMER,Mickey Mantle.
S04E15,JERRY,What happened?
S04E15,KRAMER,"Well, you know, we were playing a game and, you know, I was pitching, and I was really throwing some smoke. And Joe Pepitone, he was up, and man that guy, you know, he was crowding the plate."
S04E15,JERRY,Wow! Joe Pepitone!
S04E15,KRAMER,"Yeah, well, Joe Pepitone or not, I own the inside of that plate. So I throw one, you know, inside, you know, a little chin music, put him right on his pants. Cause I gotta intimidate when I'm on the mound. Well the next pitch, he's right back in the same place. So, I had to plunk him."
S04E15,JERRY,You plunked him.
S04E15,KRAMER,"Oh yeah. Well, he throws down his bat, he comes racing up to the mound. Next thing, both benches are cleared, you know? A brouhaha breaks out between the guys in the camp, you know, and the old Yankee players, and as I'm trying to get Moose Skowron off of one of my teammates, you know, somebody pulls me from behind, you know, and I turned around and I popped him. I looked down, and woah man, it's Mickey. I punched his lights out."
S04E15,JERRY,"Wow, this is incredible!"
S04E15,BABU,Leave me alone! You can't do this to me!
S04E15,JERRY,What's going on out there?
S04E15,BABU,"What are you doing? This is not right, people. You're making a very bad mistake, very bad."
S04E15,JERRY,Babu? (leaving) I'll be right back.
S04E15,ELAINE,"(to Kramer) Yeah, so?"
S04E15,KRAMER,"Then Hank Bauer, you know, he's screaming, ""Mickey! Mickey! What have you done with Mickey? You killed Mickey!"""
S04E15,ELAINE,So what'd you do?
S04E15,KRAMER,"Well, I got the hell out of there."
S04E15,ELAINE,They took Babu away?!
S04E15,JERRY,"Yeah, the Immigration guy said his Visa was expired. Poor Babu, everything was going so well for him. He had an apartment, he had a job. What a shame."
S04E15,JERRY,"I will, Babu! I will help you, Babu, don't worry!"
S04E15,KRAMER,"Then Hank Bauer, you know, he's chasing me around, he trips over third base and knocks over Clete Boyer."
S04E15,JERRY,(thumbing through his mail) Uh oh.
S04E15,ELAINE,What?
S04E15,JERRY,Well this is interesting.
S04E15,ELAINE,What is it?
S04E15,JERRY,"It's a letter from the Immigration Bureau, it's Babu's Visa renewal application form. They must have put it in my mailbox by mistake."
S04E15,KRAMER,"Well, doesn't he need that?"
S04E15,JERRY,"If you had given me my mail last week when I got home, this whole thing never would have happened."
S04E15,ELAINE,"Well, you should have come to my house to pick it up."
S04E15,JERRY,"Yeah, so am I being funny now?"
S04E15,ELAINE,"No, actually, you're not being funny now."
S04E15,JERRY,"See, I told you I wasn't funny all the time. (George enters) Hey George, look, I'm not funny now."
S04E15,GEORGE,"No, and you weren't funny last night either. In fact, you got us both so depressed, she asked me to drive her home after dinner."
S04E15,JERRY,"Oh look, I need to get in touch with Cheryl. Babu needs a lawyer, his Visa's expired."
S04E15,GEORGE,What do you need her for? There's a million lawyers.
S04E15,JERRY,"Yeah, but you said this is one of the things that her firm does."
S04E15,GEORGE,"Alright, alright, but no funny business, same deal as last night."
S04E15,JERRY,"Ah, will you stop it already?"
S04E15,GEORGE,"Jerry, please?"
S04E15,JERRY,How long is this gonna go on?
S04E15,GEORGE,Till I'm comfortable.
S04E15,JERRY,"Well, when is that gonna be?"
S04E15,GEORGE,After consummation.
S04E15,JERRY,Consummation? I don't think you have enough material.
S04E15,CHERYL,I actually have a friend in the Immigration Department who owes me a big favor. You're very lucky.
S04E15,JERRY,(somber) That's wonderful news. Thank you.
S04E15,CHERYL,"You're a very serious person, aren't you?"
S04E15,JERRY,"Well, with so many people in the world deprived and unhappy, it doesn't seem like it would be fair to be cheerful."
S04E15,CHERYL,I understand.
S04E15,CHERYL,I think it's curdled.
S04E15,JERRY,I don't care.
S04E15,CHERYL,Do you ever laugh?
S04E15,JERRY,"Not really. Sometimes, when I'm in the tub."
S04E15,CHERYL,That's so sad. What do you do?
S04E15,JERRY,"I'm a comedian. Oh, let me get that. (reaching for the check) You've been so helpful."
S04E15,ELAINE,"(entering as Jerry heads to the register) Hey, we're gonna go see Babu now, right?"
S04E15,JERRY,"Yeah, I'll just pay for this."
S04E15,ELAINE,"Oh, I'm just gonna go say hi to Cheryl. (walking over to the booth) Hi."
S04E15,CHERYL,Hi.
S04E15,ELAINE,"Listen, gosh, I wanted to thank you so much for convincing Ping to drop the case."
S04E15,CHERYL,"Well, after we met, you were all so nice. I just couldn't go through with it. But between you and me, you would have paid through the nose."
S04E15,JERRY,Babu!
S04E15,BABU,"Jerry! Jerry, hello Jerry!"
S04E15,JERRY,You remember Elaine.
S04E15,BABU,"Yes, yes of course!"
S04E15,ELAINE,Nice to meet you.
S04E15,BABU,So nice of you both to come.
S04E15,JERRY,"Oh, Babu."
S04E15,BABU,"No no, you're both very kind, very kind."
S04E15,ELAINE,We try.
S04E15,JERRY,We do what we can.
S04E15,ELAINE,We do what we can.
S04E15,BABU,The problem is I never got my Visa renewal form in the mail. I was expecting it.
S04E15,JERRY,"Yes, well, see, here's the thing, Babu. Um, what happened was I was away for a couple of weeks doing some comedy shows."
S04E15,BABU,Comedy shows! You're a very funny man.
S04E15,JERRY,"Well, Elaine here was picking up my mail while I was away, because you know that little box can get very full."
S04E15,BABU,"Oh yes, of course. TV Guide, magazines, everything. You know, I would have picked up your mail, your box is right next to mine."
S04E15,JERRY,"Oh, I don't want to bother you."
S04E15,BABU,"No bother! You get me job, you get me apartment, you very very good man."
S04E15,JERRY,"So yesterday, after they took you away, I looked in my mail and I noticed that the mailman accidentally put your Visa renewal in my mail box."
S04E15,BABU,Come again?
S04E15,JERRY,"You see, I've been home for a week and Elaine didn't give me my mail until yesterday, even though I asked her repeatedly for it."
S04E15,ELAINE,"Yeah, but Babu, he could have come to my house to pick it up."
S04E15,BABU,You had my Visa application?!
S04E15,JERRY,Well not technically.
S04E15,BABU,(extremely and suddenly agitated) I kill you!!
S04E15,JERRY,Well what about her?
S04E15,BABU,I kill both of you!!
S04E15,JERRY,Babu?!
S04E15,BABU,No Babu! No Babu! You bad man! You very bad man! You very lazy bad man!
S04E15,JERRY,"Babu, I'm gonna fix everything! I have a lawyer who knows someone in the Immigration Department, they're gonna straighten the whole thing out, the wheels are in motion, things are happening even as we speak!"
S04E15,BABU,The wheels are in motion?
S04E15,JERRY,"The wheels are in motion, things are happening!"
S04E15,GEORGE,Jerry?
S04E15,CHERYL,I'm very attracted to him.
S04E15,GEORGE,"You think the person you were talking to is him? That's not even close to him. He's funny, Jerry's funny."
S04E15,CHERYL,He never said anything funny.
S04E15,GEORGE,He can't not be funny.
S04E15,CHERYL,"No no no, he's dark. And disturbed."
S04E15,GEORGE,"Dark and disturbed? His whole life revolves around Superman and cereal. I convinced him to act like that so that you would think I was funnier. That's how disturbed I am! If you want disturbed, that's disturbed. You can't find sickness like that anywhere, you think sickness like that grows on trees? Nobody is sicker than me, nobody. He's pretending, I'm the genuine article."
S04E15,CHERYL,So you're telling me Jerry's whole thing was an act?
S04E15,GEORGE,"Yes! And I put him up to it, because I'm sick! I'm the one that needs help."
S04E15,CHERYL,I gotta go.
S04E15,GEORGE,"Well, should I call you later?"
S04E15,CHERYL,Please don't.
S04E15,GEORGE,"But, but I'm disturbed! I'm depressed! I'm inadequate! I got it all!!"
S04E15,ELAINE,"So, what's up with Babu? How come he's not back?"
S04E15,JERRY,"I don't know, I don't understand it. Cheryl was supposed to take care"
S04E15,GEORGE,It's George.
S04E15,JERRY,C'mon up.
S04E15,JERRY,Babu must be back.
S04E15,BABU'S BROTHER,"Babu, my goodness, what has happened to you?"
S04E15,JERRY,Where's Babu?
S04E15,BABU'S BROTHER,He is in Pakistan!
S04E15,JERRY,Who are you?
S04E15,BABU'S BROTHER,"I am his brother. He knew a lawyer, it was all going to be fixed."
S04E15,JERRY,I'm sure the lawyer did everything they could.
S04E15,BABU'S BROTHER,Then where is Babu? What happened to Babu? Show me Babu!
S04E15,ELAINE,(offering a drink) Snapple?
S04E15,BABU'S BROTHER,"No, too fruity."
S04E15,JERRY,"Hey, what happened? I thought Cheryl was gonna help Babu get his Visa."
S04E15,GEORGE,She didn't help him?
S04E15,JERRY,No.
S04E15,GEORGE,Where is he?
S04E15,JERRY,He's in Pakistan.
S04E15,GEORGE,Oh boy.
S04E15,JERRY,"What do you mean, oh boy?"
S04E15,GEORGE,"Well, last night she told me that she liked you. Not you, the disturbed you, so I had to tell her the truth."
S04E15,JERRY,"Told her the truth? Well, you got Babu deported."
S04E15,GEORGE,"What do you mean, I got? You didn't give him his Visa application."
S04E15,JERRY,That's because she had my mail.
S04E15,ELAINE,"Yeah, well I wouldn't have had to get your mail if he hadn't gone to that fantasy camp."
S04E15,KRAMER,"Well, I just came back from Mickey Mantle's restaurant."
S04E15,JERRY,How could you go in there?
S04E15,KRAMER,"Well, I had to. I had to apologize. I mean, I punched Mickey Mantle, my idol. It was eating me up inside!"
S04E15,JERRY,"Well, what happened?"
S04E15,KRAMER,"I got down in my knees and went, ""Go ahead, Mickey. Hit me. I'm begging you, Mickey, please hit me. C'mon, hit me. I love you, Mickey, I love you!"""
S04E15,ELAINE,"So, what did he do?"
S04E15,KRAMER,"Well, the four of them, they picked me up by my pants and they threw me outside, right into a horse."
S04E15,VOICE,Kramer?
S04E15,KRAMER,Yeah? It's my Chinese food.
S04E15,ELAINE,"Oh! Ping! Hi! Listen, thank you so much for dropping that lawsuit against me."
S04E15,PING,Not anymore.
S04E15,ELAINE,What?
S04E15,PING,"Cheryl call me last night, lawsuit back on."
S04E15,ELAINE,Why?
S04E15,PING,"She call you and your friends big liars. You think she nice girl? Wait till you see her in court. She's a shark! They call her the Terminator. She never lose a case. Now you make her mad. She double the damages. Hasta la vista, baby."
S04E15,BABU,"So his friend got the mail but she did not give it to him. And then he came to visit me. Said the lawyer was called to help, he said the wheels were in motion, but there was no motion. There was nothing. And so they sent me back here."
S04E15,BABU'S FRIEND,"This is a terrible story, Babu. What are you going to do?"
S04E15,BABU,"I'm going to save up every rupee. Someday, I will get back to America, and when I do I will exact vengeance on this man. I cannot forget him. He haunts me. He is a very bad man. He is a very very bad man."
S04E16,GEORGE (writing on a notepad),"Wait a second, wait a second...and then the butler says, ""I'm not cleanin' it up! I'm sick of cleaning!"""
S04E16,JERRY (copying it down and grinning),"That's funny, that's funny! ""I'm sick of cleaning."" That's very funny."
S04E16,GEORGE (laughing),"I'll tell you something, I've never seen a pilot script as funny as this!"
S04E16,JERRY,"Yeah, it's funny!"
S04E16,GEORGE,"I mean, how funny is this?"
S04E16,JERRY (low voice),It's funny.
S04E16,GEORGE,"I mean, we're not stupid, right? We know when something's funny!"
S04E16,JERRY,"It cannot not be funny! Now come on, let's stay with it, we gotta finish this today."
S04E16,GEORGE,"Okay. Hey, you know what, maybe I should give it to my therapist to read. She's smart, I trust her."
S04E16,JERRY,"Yeah, maybe I'll give it to Elaine."
S04E16,GEORGE,"Hey, you know, we haven't brought the Elaine character into the show yet. Umm, We should try and get her into this scene."
S04E16,JERRY,"Right, right. Okay. (Writing) Elaine enters."
S04E16,GEORGE,Right
S04E16,JERRY,(Thinks) What does she say...?
S04E16,GEORGE (thinking),"I don't know, what do women say?"
S04E16,JERRY,I don't know.
S04E16,GEORGE,I don't even know what they think. That's why I'm in therapy.
S04E16,JERRY,"You know, if we bring Elaine in, it's going to be so many people to keep track of. It's gonna be too hard, I'll forget where everybody's standing, you, me, Kramer, the butler, it's too much."
S04E16,GEORGE,"Alright, forget Elaine."
S04E16,JERRY,Alright. (They tear the pages out of their notepads. Kramer enters.)
S04E16,KRAMER,Hey.
S04E16,GEORGE,Hey.
S04E16,JERRY,Hey.
S04E16,KRAMER (to Jerry),You are never gonna believe who I just ran into today.
S04E16,JERRY,Who?
S04E16,KRAMER,Your old flame. Gail Cunningham.
S04E16,JERRY,Did you talk to her?
S04E16,KRAMER,"Well, I was on my way to the Y, and I saw her coming towards me? I didn't know what to do! Because I remembered you had three dates with her and she wouldn't kiss you goodnight. So now I'm thinking you know, what is my duty to my friend? Do I acknowledge her? Do I you know ignore her? I mean, what is my responsibility here?"
S04E16,JERRY,So what happened?
S04E16,KRAMER,"Yeah, yeah, so she sees me and she goes, (imitates Gail) ""Oh, hi! Kramer!"" You know? Like nothing happened! Like she never you know went three dates with you and refused to kiss you goodnight."
S04E16,JERRY,"Yeah, I know about the three dates."
S04E16,KRAMER,You know what I did? I snubbed her.
S04E16,JERRY,"What do you mean, you snubbed her?"
S04E16,KRAMER,I walked right by her - bffffft - never said a word.
S04E16,JERRY (smiling),Right by her?
S04E16,KRAMER,Right by her!
S04E16,"JERRY (to George, hugs Kramer happily)","What you do say about a guy like this, huh! (George applauds.) You are some great friend, I tell ya, snubbed her! (seriously) Not that I condone it. I've never condoned snubbing in my administration. But your loyalty is beyond question."
S04E16,KRAMER,"Yeah. Well, you know, she was lucky I was in a good mood - coulda been a lot worse."
S04E16,ELAINE (throws the script at Jerry),I'm not even in here!
S04E16,JERRY,"Yeah, I know."
S04E16,ELAINE,"Well, I thought there was going to be a character named Elaine Benes."
S04E16,JERRY,"Well, there were too many people in the room, we couldn't keep track of everybody. George, and the butler, and..."
S04E16,ELAINE,"You couldn't ""keep track"" of everybody?"
S04E16,JERRY,"Well, we tried. We couldn't. We didn't know how to, uh...(confessing) ...we couldn't write for a woman. We didn't know what you would say. Even right now, I'm sitting here, I know you're going to say something, I have no idea what it is."
S04E16,ELAINE,You have no idea?
S04E16,JERRY,Something derogatory? (Gail enters the coffee shop and walks over to the booth.)
S04E16,GAIL (to Jerry),I thought I'd find you here.
S04E16,JERRY,"Well, Gail Cunningham."
S04E16,ELAINE,"Hi, Gail."
S04E16,GAIL,"Hi, Elaine. (To Jerry) Hey, what is with your friend Kramer?"
S04E16,JERRY,Why?
S04E16,GAIL,He snubbed me.
S04E16,JERRY,Are you sure?
S04E16,GAIL,"Yeah, I'm sure. What did you tell him?"
S04E16,JERRY,"Nothing. (Elaine grabs Jerry's sandwich and is about to take a bite.) Hey, where you goin' with that? Gimme that. (Takes back the sandwich.)"
S04E16,ELAINE,I thought you were finished.
S04E16,JERRY,"I took two bites, how am I finished? (Elaine coughs.) Plus you're coming down with something? You want me to get sick? (Offers Gail the sandwich) Bite?"
S04E16,GAIL,"So, how come? Why did Kramer do that?"
S04E16,JERRY,"I don't know. Once he leaves the building, he's out of my jurisdiction."
S04E16,GAIL,"Well, tell him that I am mad at him."
S04E16,JERRY,"Alright. So, where ya cookin' now?"
S04E16,GAIL,Pfeiffer's.
S04E16,JERRY,"Ah, the power lunch crowd."
S04E16,GAIL (to Elaine),Nice shoes!
S04E16,ELAINE,Oh. Thank you.
S04E16,GAIL,Where'd you get 'em?
S04E16,ELAINE (modest),"They're um, Botticelli's."
S04E16,GAIL (impressed),"Ooh, Botticelli's! Look at you! I'm afraid to go in there."
S04E16,ELAINE,Really.
S04E16,JERRY,Would you care to join us?
S04E16,GAIL,"No, no, I gotta get to the restaurant. (Looks at her watch.) Oh! See ya. (Exits.)"
S04E16,JERRY,See ya.
S04E16,"ELAINE (irritated, imitates Gail)","""Oh, look at you, the Botticelli's."""
S04E16,JERRY,That bothered you?
S04E16,ELAINE,"Yes, it bothered me. So I bought a pair of shoes at Botticelli's, I'm not allowed to shop there? That really embarrassed me."
S04E16,JERRY,It did?
S04E16,ELAINE,Yes! Couldn't you see that?
S04E16,JERRY (thinks),No. This is why you're not in the pilot.
S04E16,DANA,"Well, George, I think you're beginning to get some perspective on things. I think we're making progress."
S04E16,GEORGE,"Yeah, I feel like I've grown."
S04E16,DANA,"Good. So, let's pick up on this next week."
S04E16,GEORGE,"Great. (They both stand.) Oh, by the way, did you get a chance to read the script?"
S04E16,DANA,"Yes, yes I did."
S04E16,GEORGE (beaming),"Well, what'd you think?"
S04E16,DANA (unenthusiastic),Uh...it was...good.
S04E16,GEORGE,You didn't like it?
S04E16,DANA,"Well, no, I -"
S04E16,GEORGE,I can't believe this! What was wrong with it? What didn't you like about it?
S04E16,DANA,It wasn't funny.
S04E16,GEORGE,"It wasn't funny? What, are you kidding?"
S04E16,DANA,"No, I didn't find it funny."
S04E16,GEORGE,You didn't find it funny?! This is what I'm paying for?
S04E16,DANA,"Well, that whole storyline about a guy who gets into a car accident, doesn't have any insurance, so the judge sentences him to be a butler? I didn't really buy that."
S04E16,GEORGE,"Let me tell you who did, uh, buy it...um we pitched this story to Russell Dalrymple, the president of NBC, and he ate it up with a spoon."
S04E16,DANA,"George, if you're going to be in a creative field, you're going to have to learn how to deal with criticism."
S04E16,GEORGE,"How's this for criticism? Um...you stink. How do like that criticism? You know what's funny to me? That diploma up on the wall. That is my idea of ""com-med-dee""! You sitting here, telling people what to do."
S04E16,DANA,I think you'd better go.
S04E16,GEORGE,"Oh, I'm goin' baby. I'm goin.' (Heads for the door, then stops.) It's Jerry's fault. He took out all my good lines. He's such a control freak!"
S04E16,"GEORGE (immediately, to Elaine)","So, you send me to this therapist to help me with my emotional disorders, and she criticizes our script. (Tosses the script to Jerry.) What kind of a therapist is that?"
S04E16,ELAINE,I guess she didn't think it was funny.
S04E16,GEORGE,"Oh, she didn't think it was funny. What is she, Rowan & Martin? We're supposed to meet with NBC tomorrow! She completely shattered my confidence. And I'm paying for this, she's my employee!"
S04E16,JERRY,I thought your mother's paying for it.
S04E16,GEORGE,"And she slaves to earn every penny. So that someday, I might be able to walk up to a woman and say, ""Yes, I'm bald, but I'm still a good person."""
S04E16,JERRY (to Elaine),"You know, he's right. It's not her place to criticize the script, which reminds me - what did you think of it? You never told me."
S04E16,ELAINE,What did I think of it? (Manufactures a cough instead of answering. Kramer enters.)
S04E16,KRAMER (to Jerry),"Hey, buddy, I got something to tell ya. (Elaine runs towards to the bathroom in lieu of answering Jerry's question.)"
S04E16,JERRY (catches Elaine),"Hey, one second, you don't get off that easy. C'mon, tell me what you thought."
S04E16,ELAINE,"Well, you know, I..."
S04E16,KRAMER,"I just kissed Gail Cunningham. (Jerry turns and looks at Kramer, shocked. Elaine grins and heads to the bathroom.)"
S04E16,JERRY,You what?
S04E16,KRAMER,"Yeah, I kissed her."
S04E16,JERRY,You kissed her?
S04E16,KRAMER,Right on the mouth.
S04E16,JERRY,What kinda great friend are you? How do you go from snubbing to kissing?
S04E16,KRAMER,"Well, I saw her outside the Y, you know, she came up to me, she started yelling because I snubbed her, and then we started talking a little bit, and I walked her to her building. And just before I left, I put my arm around her waist, I pulled her to me, and I - mmm - I planted one! (Laughs.)"
S04E16,JERRY,And what did she do?
S04E16,KRAMER,She kissed me back.
S04E16,JERRY,"I don't get this. I go out with this girl three times, she doesn't want to shake my hand - why's she kissing you?"
S04E16,KRAMER (realizing),"Because I snubbed her. You see? Women, they like that! Yes! I understand women. The snub is good, they love the snub!"
S04E16,GEORGE,"No they don't. I tried that once. I snubbed for a year. Nothing. Every woman I saw, I snubbed. You never saw people so pleased. (Elaine returns from the bathroom.)"
S04E16,KRAMER (to Elaine),"Ooh, so...I understand you're buying your shoes now at Botticelli's."
S04E16,ELAINE,What? Who told you that?
S04E16,KRAMER,Gail Cunningham.
S04E16,ELAINE,"I don't understand, why is this woman talking about my shoes? Why are my shoes a topic of conversation?"
S04E16,KRAMER,"Well, you know, we were just talking, and uh she mentioned how you're buying your shoes now at Botticelli's."
S04E16,ELAINE (angrily),"""How I'm buying my shoes now at Botticelli's!"" Did you hear this? (Shoves Jerry and Kramer.)"
S04E16,JERRY,So what?
S04E16,ELAINE,"So what?! She is talking about my shoes! She is discussing my shoes! It is nobody's business where I buy my shoes! (Storms over to the couch and angrily sits down. Jerry, Kramer and George look at Elaine from the kitchen, comically puzzled by her outburst...)"
S04E16,ELAINE,Hey! Gail!
S04E16,GAIL,Ya. (noticing it's Elaine) Elaine...!
S04E16,ELAINE,Why are you talking about my shoes?
S04E16,GAIL,What?
S04E16,ELAINE,My Botticelli shoes. You've been talking about my Botticelli shoes.
S04E16,GAIL,What are you talking about?
S04E16,ELAINE,Did you or did you not tell Kramer that I got my shoes at Botticelli's? (A waiter comes over and puts a plate of food on Gail's cutting board.)
S04E16,WAITER,Too spicy. He wants another one. You got that pasta primavera?
S04E16,GAIL,"Look Elaine, I am very busy here."
S04E16,ELAINE,"Who else have you mentioned my shoes to, huh? I wanna know why my footwear is your conversation!"
S04E16,GAIL,I am not discussing this. This is insane.
S04E16,WAITER,You got that pasta primavera? Let's go!
S04E16,GAIL,"Ya ya ya, here."
S04E16,WAITER,"Here you are, Mr. Dalrymple."
S04E16,RUSSELL,Thank you.
S04E16,WAITER,Sorry for the delay. Enjoy your lunch.
S04E16,RUSSELL (opening the door),"Well, come in. (They shake hands.)"
S04E16,JERRY & GEORGE,Hi.
S04E16,RUSSELL,"Awfully sorry to make you come up here, but I really wasn't feeling well enough to go back to the office, and well, it's the only chance I have to meet with you this week."
S04E16,JERRY,Are you alright?
S04E16,RUSSELL,"Well, it's my stomach. I think there must have been something in the pasta primavera I had for lunch."
S04E16,JERRY,"Oh, Where did you eat?"
S04E16,RUSSELL,Pfeiffer's.
S04E16,JERRY,Ah. I know the chef there.
S04E16,RUSSELL,Yeah. The food's usually terrific.
S04E16,GEORGE,My cousin worked for Bouchard's. They used to use the bouilla-base for a toilet. (Jerry and Russell are shocked.)
S04E16,RUSSELL,What are you saying?
S04E16,GEORGE,"Well, you didn't hear it from me, but needless to say, if you go in there - stick with the consumee."
S04E16,RUSSELL,"Well, we'd better get started, my daughter's going to be here soon."
S04E16,JERRY,"Oh, you have a daughter?"
S04E16,RUSSELL,"Yeah, she just turned fifteen last week."
S04E16,GEORGE,"Aw, that's a fun age. (Jerry looks at George distastefully.)"
S04E16,RUSSELL,"Alright. The script. Now, I've read this thing three times...and everytime I read it...(looks nauseous, struggles not to vomit.)"
S04E16,JERRY,What?
S04E16,RUSSELL,Excuse me for a second. (Gets up and runs to the bathroom.)
S04E16,JERRY,What?
S04E16,GEORGE,"Would you like a Pepto-Bismol? I keep them in my wallet...! (Russell goes into the bathroom and shuts the door.) (To Jerry) Do you think he liked it? (From the bathroom, we hear Russell violently heaving his guts.)"
S04E16,JERRY,I'm not sure. (The sounds of Russell vomiting emanate from the bathroom. Jerry and George sit there uncomfortably.) What was that dish he said he had...?
S04E16,GEORGE,Pasta primavera.
S04E16,JERRY,"Ah. You know, 'primavera' is Italian for 'spring.'"
S04E16,GEORGE,No!
S04E16,JERRY,Yeah.
S04E16,RUSSELL (coming out of the bathroom),"Really, I'm terribly sorry, it just, uh...all of a sudden it just hit me."
S04E16,GEORGE,"So, you were saying how, um...about the script..."
S04E16,RUSSELL,"Right. The script. Your script needs some...it needs, um...(looks nauseous again. Gets up and runs to the bathroom a second time.)"
S04E16,GEORGE,More jokes?
S04E16,JERRY,Another ending?
S04E16,GEORGE,A different name for the butler? (Russell throws up again.)
S04E16,JERRY,Maybe we should go.
S04E16,GEORGE,"We haven't heard his notes yet, we don't know how he feels about our work. (Russell throws up yet again.)"
S04E16,RUSSELL (from bathroom),Oh God. Oh my god.
S04E16,JERRY,"I can't listen to anymore of this, the guy's losing a lung in there. (Russell's daughter Molly enters.)"
S04E16,MOLLY,Hello.
S04E16,JERRY,Hi.
S04E16,GEORGE,Hi.
S04E16,MOLLY,I'm Molly.
S04E16,JERRY,"Oh, I'm Jerry."
S04E16,GEORGE,George.
S04E16,JERRY,We're here discussing our script with your father.
S04E16,GEORGE,He just read it. (Russell vomits again. Jerry and George look ashamed.)
S04E16,MOLLY,Daddy? Are you okay?
S04E16,RUSSELL (from bathroom),"Yeah, yeah sweetie. I'm fine. (Molly sits on the back of the chair.)"
S04E16,GEORGE,"So, you live with your mother, huh?"
S04E16,MOLLY,"Uh, yeah."
S04E16,GEORGE (to Jerry),Divorce is very difficult. Especially on a kid.
S04E16,JERRY,Uh huh.
S04E16,GEORGE,"Of course, I'm the result of my parents having stayed together, so you never know. (Russell comes out of the bathroom.)"
S04E16,MOLLY,"Daddy, are you alright? What's the matter?"
S04E16,RUSSELL,It's just a stomach thing.
S04E16,MOLLY,Yuck.
S04E16,RUSSELL (to Jerry and George),"We're going to have to do this some other time, so if you'll give me your number, I'll call you later. (Jerry and George nod. Molly takes her jacket off.)"
S04E16,GEORGE,"You know, suddenly I'm in the mood for pasta primavera myself. (Jerry nudges George to sneak a peek at Molly's cleavage as she bends over and looks in her backpack. Jerry has a quick look, but George stares, hypnotized. Russell comes up behind George.)"
S04E16,RUSSELL (angrily),"Get a good look, Costanza?"
S04E16,JERRY,What were you doing?
S04E16,GEORGE,"Well, it's not my fault. You poked me!"
S04E16,JERRY,You're supposed to just take a peek after a poke. You were like you just put a quarter into one of those big metal things on top of the Empire State Building.
S04E16,GEORGE,"It's cleavage. I couldn't look away. What am I, waiting to win an Oscar here? This is all I have in my life."
S04E16,JERRY,"Looking at cleavage is like looking at the sun, you don't stare at it. It's too risky. You get a sense of it and then you look away."
S04E16,GEORGE,"All right. So, he caught me in a cleavage peek, so big deal. Who wouldn't look at his daughter's cleavage? She's got nice cleavage."
S04E16,JERRY,That's why I poked.
S04E16,GEORGE,"That's why I peeked. (Jerry opens the door to take some trash out, and meets Kramer and Gail in the hallway.)"
S04E16,GAIL,Hey! What is with your friend Elaine?
S04E16,JERRY,What?
S04E16,GAIL,"She comes to my restaurant, comes right in my kitchen, and starts complaining that I'm talking about her shoes."
S04E16,JERRY,She did?
S04E16,KRAMER,Right in the kitchen. Disgraceful.
S04E16,GAIL,"So, I don't want people coming into my kitchen. I think she might have sneezed all over someone's pasta primavera. Someone might have gotten sick because of her. (Kramer and Gail exit.)"
S04E16,GEORGE,Pasta primavera?
S04E16,JERRY,Is that what she said? (Kramer pokes his head back in the door.)
S04E16,KRAMER (to Jerry),"She's somethin', huh? She's a wild one. She's wearin' me out."
S04E16,JERRY,She is?
S04E16,KRAMER,"She's sensual. You know, with the...cooking and all. (Kramer grins happily at Jerry and leaves. The phone rings. Jerry tosses the trashbag to George.)"
S04E16,JERRY,"Hello? Oh, hi Stu."
S04E16,GEORGE (lazily swinging the garbage bag around),From NBC?
S04E16,JERRY,"(to George) Yeah. (oh the phone) What's goin' on? What? Really? Oh my god....did he give you a reason?...Oh boy. Okay. Alright. Thanks. (hangs up.) Dalrymple just cancelled the pilot. (George drops the bag, shocked.)"
S04E16,JERRY (to Elaine),"If you hadn't gone into her restaurant, this never would have happened."
S04E16,ELAINE,"Look, I don't like people talking about my shoes behind my back, okay? My shoes are my business. The two of you shouldn't have been looking at some fifteen year-old's cleavage anyway!"
S04E16,GEORGE,He poked me!
S04E16,JERRY,"There was cleavage in the area. That's a reflex - (mimics nudging someone with an elbow) - cleavage-poke, cleavage-poke..."
S04E16,ELAINE,But she was fifteen.
S04E16,JERRY,"You don't consider age in the face of cleavage. This occurs on a molecular level, you can't control it! We're like some kind of weird fish where the eyes operate independently of the head."
S04E16,GEORGE,"Alright, what's the difference. What are we gonna do now? He won't take our calls, we can't get into his office..."
S04E16,JERRY,"You know what we could do? He eats at that restaurant, Pfeiffer's? We could have Gail call us, tell us the next time he's there, go there and talk to him."
S04E16,GEORGE,"Hey, now you're onto something."
S04E16,JERRY,The whole thing is so stupid. Like he wouldn't do the same thing if Elaine walked by in a low-cut dress.
S04E16,GEORGE,"Yeah. Well, maybe not Elaine."
S04E16,JERRY,No.
S04E16,GEORGE,"But...somebody like Gail, though."
S04E16,JERRY,Ya.
S04E16,ELAINE,"What? What do you mean, Gail? (Kramer enters.)"
S04E16,KRAMER,Yah-hey.
S04E16,JERRY,"Kramer, listen, I want you to ask Gail to do me a favor. The next time Russell Dalrymple comes in the restaurant, ask her if she would call me."
S04E16,KRAMER,"Alright, I'll call her right now."
S04E16,JERRY,Ok. (Kramer goes back to his apartment.)
S04E16,ELAINE (to George),"What do you mean, Gail? You don't think I can attract attention? You don't think I can put asses in the seats?"
S04E16,JERRY,"Look, sweetheart, you know you've got it all. But let's face it... (Kramer comes back.)"
S04E16,KRAMER,She said she'll do it.
S04E16,GEORGE,Beautiful.
S04E16,JERRY,Beautiful.
S04E16,KRAMER (points at Elaine's feet),But she wants the shoes.
S04E16,ELAINE,What?
S04E16,KRAMER,She says she wants those shoes.
S04E16,ELAINE,She wants my shoes? What kind of person is this? Alright! She is not getting 'em!
S04E16,JERRY,"No, come on! I'll buy you another pair!"
S04E16,ELAINE,"No, these were the last pair of these that they had!"
S04E16,JERRY,I'll get you another one just like it!
S04E16,ELAINE,"No, but these were the only really cool ones like this! Don't you see how everybody likes 'em and how everybody talks about 'em? (Jerry, realizing Elaine's motivation, sits at the counter unbelievingly.)"
S04E16,"GEORGE (to Elaine, in a somber tone)","Elaine, this pilot...it doesn't matter to me, it's not me I'm concerned about...it's my mother. I've been over to the hospital to see her..."
S04E16,ELAINE,"Oh yeah, because she caught you jer -"
S04E16,GEORGE,Never mind!
S04E16,ELAINE,"Oh, come on, wait a second, this whole thing is ridiculous. How do I even know she wears the same size?"
S04E16,KRAMER,"Alright, what size are you?"
S04E16,ELAINE,Seven-and-a-half.
S04E16,KRAMER,Eh! Bingo.
S04E16,GAIL (hands a plate to another chef),"Sauce this. (Goes to the telephone and dials.) Yeah, he's here. Oh, and one more thing...bring the shoes. (Hangs up.)"
S04E16,JERRY,Hey! Whattaya know!
S04E16,GEORGE,Look who's here!
S04E16,JERRY,Fancy meeting you here!
S04E16,RUSSELL,Oh. Hello.
S04E16,GEORGE (notices Russell's lunch),Pasta primavera! Back on the horse.
S04E16,JERRY,"You know, it's a funny thing, because after the pilot got cancelled, we hadn't heard from you."
S04E16,GEORGE,Didn't hear anything...
S04E16,JERRY,Didn't know...we were wondering...what happened.
S04E16,RUSSELL,"Well, it just didn't seem to be the right project for us right now. (Elaine walks by in a low-cut dress. Jerry and George look at her as she moves to the table opposite Russell.) So, what were you saying?"
S04E16,GEORGE,"Oh...uh, because if it had anything at all to do with what you perceived as me leering at your daughter, I really have to take issue with that. I did not leer. (To Jerry) Did I leer?"
S04E16,JERRY,No leer. (Elaine comes over to Russell's table.)
S04E16,ELAINE (to Russell),"Uh, excuse me, are you using that ketchup?"
S04E16,RUSSELL (not noticing Elaine's cleavage),"Uh, no. (Elaine takes the ketchup and goes back to her table.)"
S04E16,GEORGE,"Because, if I'm looking straight ahead, and something enters my field of vision, that's merely a happenstance. (Elaine loudly snaps and unfolds her napkin at the next table to get Russell's attention.)"
S04E16,RUSSELL,"Under the circumstances, I don't really feel that we should be in business together. (Elaine comes back over.)"
S04E16,ELAINE,"Here's your ketchup back. You know, I had the hardest time trying to get some out. I mean, I just kept pounding and pounding on the bottom of it. Do you have any trouble?"
S04E16,RUSSELL (still not noticing Elaine's cleavage),No.
S04E16,ELAINE (leaning forward),Do you have a...ketchup secret?
S04E16,RUSSELL,"No, I... (finally notices Elaine)...don't have a ketchup secret. (Smiles.)"
S04E16,ELAINE (flirtatiously),"Because if you do have a ketchup secret, I would really, really like to know what it is. (Russell is pleased, and smiles at Elaine. Elaine goes back to her table, sits down, and waves at Russell.)"
S04E16,"RUSSELL (to Jerry and George, reconsidering about the pilot)","Field of vision, huh?"
S04E16,GAIL,How's everything?
S04E16,ELAINE,Mmmm.
S04E16,JERRY,Really good.
S04E16,GEORGE,This pasta primavera is fabulous.
S04E16,JERRY,Very tasty.
S04E16,GAIL,How'd everything go with that NBC guy?
S04E16,GEORGE,Great.
S04E16,JERRY,"The pilot's back on. In fact, Elaine's going out with him tomorrow night. (Gail nods and walks away.) Listen, Elaine, you know if Russell mentions anything about the pilot, you'll of course tell him how much you liked it...?"
S04E16,ELAINE,"You know, I happen to have the script right here with me and, uh...on page 3, for example, suppose the Elaine character comes in wearing a...a low-cut dress. And the butler is very distracted, and can't work."
S04E16,JERRY,"Uh...that kind of comedy, that's a little broad for us."
S04E16,ELAINE,"Well, I'm sure it's right up Russell's alley."
S04E16,GEORGE,"Well, it's a funny idea."
S04E16,JERRY,It's funny!
S04E16,GEORGE,"C'mon, funny is funny."
S04E16,JERRY,"Funny is funny, we're here to entertain, right?"
S04E16,ELAINE,"Alright, well, maybe I'll mention it to Russell tomorrow night."
S04E16,JERRY,If you can.
S04E16,GEORGE,"Yeah. Where's he taking you, by the way?"
S04E16,ELAINE,"Bouchard's, on 53rd. (George starts choking on his wine, and attempts to tell Elaine something.)"
S04E16,JERRY,"I think what he's trying to say is, ""get the bouilla-base."" (George nods 'yes' and continues to choke.)"
S04E17,ALLISON,I don't want to *live*! I don't want to *live*!
S04E17,GEORGE,Because of me? You must be joking! Who wouldn't want to live because of me? I'm nothing!
S04E17,ALLISON,No... You're *something*.
S04E17,GEORGE,You can do better than me. You could throw a dart out the window and hit someone better than me. I'm no good!
S04E17,ALLISON,You're good. You're *good*!
S04E17,GEORGE,I'm bad. I'm *bad*!
S04E17,ALLISON,You're *killing* me!
S04E17,GEORGE,So what could I do? I couldn't go through with it. She threatened to kill herself.
S04E17,ELAINE,Over you?
S04E17,GEORGE,"Yes. Why, is that so inconceivable?"
S04E17,GEORGE,"I got two tickets to see ""Guys And Dolls""."
S04E17,ELAINE,I got him a two-line phone.
S04E17,JERRY,Unbelievable! She's not there.
S04E17,GEORGE,What paper does she write for?
S04E17,JERRY,"The works for the NYU school newspaper. She's a grad student in journalism. Never been to a comedy club. Never even seen me, has no idea who I am."
S04E17,ELAINE,Never even seen you? Gotta kinda envy that...
S04E17,JERRY,"Y'know, you've been developing quite the acid-tongue lately..."
S04E17,ELAINE,[Proudly] Really?
S04E17,ELAINE,"Hey, who do you think is the most unattractive world leader?"
S04E17,JERRY,Living or all time?
S04E17,ELAINE,All time.
S04E17,JERRY,"Well, if it's all time, then there's no contest. It begins and ends with Brezhnev."
S04E17,ELAINE,I dunno. You ever get a good look at DeGaulle?
S04E17,GEORGE,Lyndon Johnson was uglier than Degaulle.
S04E17,ELAINE,I got news for you. Golda Meir could make 'em all run up a tree.
S04E17,ELAINE,"Y'know, just because you two are homosexuals, so what? I mean you should just come out of the closet and be openly gay already."
S04E17,GEORGE,"So, whaddya say? You know you'll always be the only man I'll ever love."
S04E17,JERRY,[indignantly] What's the matter with you?
S04E17,GEORGE,"[quietly] C'mon, go along..."
S04E17,JERRY,"I'm not goin' along. I can just see you in Berlin in 1939 goose- stepping past me ""C'mon Jerry, go along, go along..."""
S04E17,JERRY,Y'know I hear that all the time.
S04E17,ELAINE,Hear what?
S04E17,JERRY,That I'm gay. People think I'm gay.
S04E17,ELAINE,"Yeah, you know people ask me that about you, too."
S04E17,JERRY,"Yeah, 'cuz I'm single, I'm thin and I'm neat."
S04E17,ELAINE,And you get along well with women.
S04E17,GEORGE,I guess that leaves me in the clear...
S04E17,GEORGE,"I just thought of a great name for myself, if I ever become a porno actor."
S04E17,JERRY,"Oh yeah, what? ""Buck Naked""?"
S04E17,GEORGE,"Yeah, how did you know that?"
S04E17,JERRY,You told me that already like two months ago.
S04E17,GEORGE,Allison bought it for me.
S04E17,JERRY,How you gonna get out of *that* one?
S04E17,GEORGE,I dunno. I guess I have to wait for her to die.
S04E17,JERRY,He's gonna hang around if that's alright with you?
S04E17,SHARON,"Sure, I'd like to talk to him, too."
S04E17,GEORGE,Jerry did you wash this pear?
S04E17,JERRY,"Yeah, I washed it."
S04E17,GEORGE,It looks like it hasn't been washed.
S04E17,JERRY,So *wash* *it*.
S04E17,GEORGE,You hear the way he talks to me?
S04E17,SHARON,You should hear how *my* boyfriend talks to me...
S04E17,GEORGE,Let me ask you something. What do you think of this shirt?
S04E17,SHARON,It's nice.
S04E17,GEORGE,Jerry said he didn't like it.
S04E17,JERRY,I didn't say I didn't like it. I said it was O.K...
S04E17,GEORGE,"No, you said you didn't like it..."
S04E17,JERRY,"Oh, so what if I don't like it. Is that like the end of the world, or something?"
S04E17,SHARON,So how did you two meet?
S04E17,JERRY,"Actually, we met in the gym locker room."
S04E17,GEORGE,Yeah. Actually it was in gym class. I was trying to climb the ropes and Jerry was spotting me. I kept slipping and burning my thighs and then finally I slipped and fell on Jerry's head. We've been close ever since.
S04E17,"(George takes a hold of Jerry's leg to stress the point and Sharon, who obviously thinks she has a real story here now, asks another question",)
S04E17,SHARON,Do you guys live together?
S04E17,JERRY,[quizzically] Live together?
S04E17,GEORGE,"No, I got my own place."
S04E17,"(Jerry is about *this* close (picture my thumb and forefinger *really* close together) to figuring out what is going on here, when the ""question fatale"" is asked",)
S04E17,SHARON,And do your parents know?
S04E17,JERRY,Know *what*?
S04E17,GEORGE,My parents? They don't know *what's* goin' on...
S04E17,JERRY,"Oh God, you're that girl in the coffee shop that was eavesdropping on us. I *knew* you looked familiar!"
S04E17,JERRY,There's been a big misunderstanding here! We did that whole thing for your benefit. We knew you were eavesdropping. That's why my friend said all that. It was on purpose! We're not gay! Not that there's anything wrong with that...
S04E17,GEORGE,"No, of course not..."
S04E17,JERRY,I mean that's fine if that's who you are...
S04E17,GEORGE,Absolutely...
S04E17,JERRY,I mean I have many gay friends...
S04E17,GEORGE,My *father* is gay...
S04E17,SHARON,"Look, I know what I heard."
S04E17,JERRY,It was a *joke*...
S04E17,GEORGE,"Look, you wanna have sex right now? Do want to have sex with me right now? Let's go! C'mon, let's go baby! C'mon!"
S04E17,"(Not that that approach was going to work, or anything, but what minute chance they had of convincing her is blown away as the door bursts open and",)
S04E17,KRAMER,"Hey, C'mon! Let's go! I thought we were going to take a steam!"
S04E17,GEORGE,No!
S04E17,JERRY,No steam!
S04E17,KRAMER,Well I don't want to sit there naked all by myself!
S04E17,KRAMER,Happy birthday paruba!
S04E17,JERRY,Today's not my birthday.
S04E17,KRAMER,"Well, I beg to differ..."
S04E17,JERRY,Look at this! A phone! A two-line phone!
S04E17,JERRY,"Hey, where you going?"
S04E17,ELAINE,I gotta go return something...
S04E17,SHARON,"Jerry, it's Sharon from NYU. I'm just calling to tell you that I'm not going to play up that angle we talked about and I'm sorry."
S04E17,JERRY,"Thank you very much, that's great- >click< Oh! Hold on a sec, I got a call on the other line. >click click< Hello?"
S04E17,GEORGE,Hey.
S04E17,JERRY,"Hey, how ya doin'? Y'know I got that reporter from the newspaper on the other line."
S04E17,GEORGE,"So, what did she say?"
S04E17,JERRY,"She says she's not going to play up that angle of the story. She thinks we're heterosexual. [sarcastically] I guess we *fooled* her. I'll get rid of her, hold on... >click click< Sharon? Hello? Sharon, are you there? >click click< I'm back..."
S04E17,GEORGE,Y'know... I could hear you on the other line...
S04E17,JERRY,What are you talkin' about?
S04E17,GEORGE,"I heard what you said ""Sharon, are you there?""."
S04E17,JERRY,"You heard me talkin' on the other line, are you sure?"
S04E17,GEORGE,"Yes, I heard you!"
S04E17,JERRY,"Well, maybe she was disconnected."
S04E17,GEORGE,Maybe she wasn't! Maybe she heard the whole conversation!
S04E17,JERRY,"Alright, hang on. Let me call Kramer and see if you can hear anything, hold on. >click click click<..."
S04E17,KRAMER,Yello?
S04E17,JERRY,"Kramer, there may be a problem with the phone, hold on. >click click<"
S04E17,GEORGE,"""There may be a problem with the phone, hold on""!"
S04E17,JERRY,"Oh no! >click click< Kramer, this phone's a piece of junk, goodbye!"
S04E17,GEORGE,"""The phone's a piece of junk, goodbye""!"
S04E17,JERRY,Oh no! Now she's heard everything! What are we gonna do?!?
S04E17,GEORGE,"Now she thinks we're gay, not that there's anything wrong with it..."
S04E17,JERRY,"No, no, of course not! People's personal sexual preferences are nobody's business but their own!"
S04E17,SHARON,Why don't you take a seat?
S04E17,ELAINE,Thank-you.
S04E17,SHARON,Why don't you take your coat off?
S04E17,ELAINE,"So she kept insisting I take off my coat. I refused, and then she forcibly tried to get me to remove it."
S04E17,JERRY,"She wouldn't take her coat off at my house, either."
S04E17,GEORGE,"Y'know there are tribes in Indonesia where if you keep your coat on in somebody's house, the families go to war!"
S04E17,JERRY,"So you don't take your coat off, and now everyone at NYU thinks I'm gay. Not that there's anything wrong with that..."
S04E17,GEORGE,Not at all.
S04E17,GEORGE,"Two tickets to ""Guys And Dolls""! I'm gonna go with you!"
S04E17,JERRY,"""Guys And Dolls""? Isn't that a lavish, Broadway musical?"
S04E17,GEORGE,"It's ""Guys And *Dolls*"", not ""Guys And *Guys*""."
S04E17,JERRY,"""The Collected Works Of Bette Midler""."
S04E17,JERRY,What do you got there?
S04E17,MAN #1,"_The New York Post_, they've got an article about you."
S04E17,JERRY,"""Although they maintain separate residences, the comedian and his long-time *companion* seem to be inseparable..."" Oh no! The Associated Press picked up the NYU story. That's going to be in every paper! I've been ""outed""! I wasn't even ""in""!"
S04E17,GEORGE,Now everyone's going to think we're gay!
S04E17,JERRY,Not that there's anything wrong with that...
S04E17,GEORGE,"No, not at all..."
S04E17,JERRY,"""Within the confines of his fastidious bachelor *pad*, Seinfeld and Costanza bicker over the cleanliness of a piece of *fruit* like an old married couple--"" *I told you that pear was washed*!"
S04E17,KRAMER,I thought we were friends...
S04E17,JERRY,Here we go...
S04E17,KRAMER,"I mean, how could you two keep this a secret from me?"
S04E17,JERRY,It's not true!
S04E17,KRAMER,"Aaaah! Enough lying! The lying is through! C'mon, Jerry, the masquerade is over. You're thin, late thirties, single..."
S04E17,JERRY,So are you...
S04E17,KRAMER,Yeah--
S04E17,GEORGE,Hello?
S04E17,MRS. S,George?
S04E17,GEORGE,Mrs. Seinfeld?!?
S04E17,MRS. S,"Oh, my God..."
S04E17,JERRY,"Oh, my God! [takes the phone] Ma?"
S04E17,MRS. S,Jerry?
S04E17,JERRY,Ma!
S04E17,GEORGE,"Oh, my God! My *MOTHER*!!!"
S04E17,MRS. S,Jerry?
S04E17,JERRY,"Ma, it's not true!"
S04E17,MR. S,It's those damn culottes you made him wear when he was five!
S04E17,MRS. S,"They weren't culottes, they were shorts."
S04E17,MR. S,They were culottes! You bought them in the girl's department.
S04E17,MRS. S,"By mistake! By mistake, Jerry! I'm sorry!"
S04E17,MR. S,"It looked like he was wearing a skirt, for crying out loud!"
S04E17,JERRY,"Ma, it has nothing to do with the culottes!"
S04E17,MRS. S,"Not that there's anything wrong with that, Jerry."
S04E17,MRS. C,"I open up the paper, and *this* is what I have to read about? I fell right off the toilet. My back went out again, I couldn't move... The super had to come and get help me up. I was half naked!"
S04E17,GEORGE,It's *not* *true*!
S04E17,MRS. C,Every *day* it's something else with you. I don't know anything about you any more. Who are you? What kind of life are you leading? Who knows *what* you're doing? Maybe you're making porno films.
S04E17,GEORGE,Yeah. I'm Buck Naked.
S04E17,MRS. C,"Jerry, I can see. He's so neat and thin. Not that there's anything wrong with it."
S04E17,GEORGE,Of course not...
S04E17,NURSE,"630, Scott. Time for your sponge bath."
S04E17,GEORGE,"Alright, now the play is tomorrow night. So do you want to have dinner first, or do you just want to meet at the theatre?"
S04E17,SAILOR,"Excuse me, sir? I don't mean to bother you. I just wanted you to know that it took a lot of guts to come out the way you did, and that you've inspired me to do the same, even though that may mean a discharge from the service. Thanks."
S04E17,JERRY,"Y'know, I think I'll pass on the ""Guys And Dolls""..."
S04E17,GEORGE,No. Just imagine her reaction.
S04E17,ELAINE,Yeah...
S04E17,GEORGE,"Oh, my God..."
S04E17,JERRY,What?
S04E17,GEORGE,"She hasn't seen the article! When she sees it, she's gonna think-- *I'm out baby*!! I'm out!!!!!"
S04E17,ALLISON,Yeah? So?
S04E17,GEORGE,Yeah so??
S04E17,ALLISON,Well this is nice. They mention your name.
S04E17,GEORGE,Don't you see what it says here? Don't you understand what that's implying?
S04E17,ALLISON,"No, what?"
S04E17,GEORGE,"I'm gay! I'm a gay man! I'm very, very gay."
S04E17,ALLISON,You're *gay*?
S04E17,GEORGE,Extraordinarily gay. Steeped in gayness.
S04E17,ALLISON,[matter-of-factly] I don't believe it.
S04E17,GEORGE,You don't believe me? Ask Jerry.
S04E17,ALLISON,I will.
S04E17,GEORGE,What do you mean you will? That's a bad idea. Jerry is a very private person.
S04E17,ALLISON,[Grabs George's lapels] I want to hear it from *Jerry*...
S04E17,SHARON,"Oh, can you ever forgive me?"
S04E17,JERRY,"I dunno... [they kiss again] *Alright*, I forgive you..."
S04E17,SHARON,"Y'know the funny thing is, I was attracted to you immediately."
S04E17,JERRY,"I was attracted to you, too. You remind me of Lois Lane."
S04E17,GEORGE,"Jerry! Oh, my God! What are you doing!?!"
S04E17,JERRY,What!?
S04E17,GEORGE,You're with a *woman*!
S04E17,JERRY,I know! What are you doin' here?!?
S04E17,GEORGE,"I leave you alone for two seconds, and this is what you do! I trusted you!"
S04E17,JERRY,[forcibly removing G. from the apt] Would you get the Hell out of here!
S04E17,SHARON,What's going on?
S04E17,ALLISON,"Yeah, what's going on?"
S04E17,GEORGE,"Alright, tell her. Go ahead."
S04E17,JERRY,Tell her what?
S04E17,GEORGE,Y'know. About *us*.
S04E17,GEORGE,"Alright, I'll tell you the truth. I'm not gay. My name's Buck Naked, I'm a porno actor."
S04E17,ALLISON,*Really*?
S04E17,KRAMER,We'll see you later...
S04E17,KRAMER,He's the *phone* man!
S04E17,KRAMER,Not that there's anything wrong with that...
S04E17,"I am not gay. I am, however, thin, single and neat. Sometimes when someone is thin, single and neat people assume they are gay because that is a stereotype. They normally don't think of gay people as fat, sloppy and married. Although I'm sure there are, I don't want to perpetuate the stereotype. I'm sure they are the minority though within the gay community. They're probably discriminated against because of that, people say to them ""Y'know Joe, I enjoy being gay with you but I think think it's about time, y'know that you got in shape, tucked the shirt in and lost the wife"". But if people are even going to assume that people that are neat are gay, maybe instead of doin' this","""Y'know I think Joe might be a little... [waves hand back and forth]"", they should vacuum ""Y'know I think Joe might be >vroom< [makes vacuuming motion]. Yeah, I got a feeling he's a little >vrooom<..."""
S04E18,GEORGE,"Oh, what's the point? When I like them, they don't like me, when they like me, I don't like them. Why can't I act with the ones I like the same way I do with the ones I don't like?"
S04E18,JERRY,"Well, you've only got another fifty years or so to go before it'll *all* be over..."
S04E18,GEORGE,Maybe I need someone who doesn't speak English.
S04E18,JERRY,"Yeah, how about a mute?"
S04E18,GEORGE,A mute would be good.
S04E18,JERRY,"Ah, where you gonna meet a mute?"
S04E18,GEORGE,This is what my life has come to... Tryin to meet a mute.
S04E18,GEORGE,"I dunno, Jerry somethin's missing. There's a void, Jerry, there's a void..."
S04E18,JERRY,"A deep, yawning chasm..."
S04E18,GEORGE,There's gotta be more to life than this. What gives you pleasure?
S04E18,JERRY,Listening to you. I listen to this for fifteen minutes and I'm on top of the world. Your misery is my pleasure.
S04E18,ELAINE,Hey boys!
S04E18,JERRY,Hey! How you doin'?
S04E18,ELAINE,"Good. Okay, well, it's all set. I start tomorrow."
S04E18,GEORGE,Start what?
S04E18,ELAINE,I signed up to do volunteer work with senior citizens.
S04E18,GEORGE,*Really*.
S04E18,ELAINE,"Yeah. God, I can't tell you how I feel! I mean, I feel *so* *good*! I *really* feel good. The strange thing is, I mean, I haven't even met the woman yet."
S04E18,GEORGE,"Volunteer work, huh?"
S04E18,JERRY,What're you gonna do down there?
S04E18,ELAINE,"Well, they say all it is is that you go over to their apartment and, I dunno, you take them for a walk and you get a cup of coffee and it's supposed to make them feel good."
S04E18,JERRY,That's what I do with him [points at George]
S04E18,GEORGE,When did you get this idea?
S04E18,ELAINE,Last time I had lunch with you here. You were going *on* and *on* and *on* about how you wanted to meet somebody who didn't speak English.
S04E18,JERRY,"What, do you break it in with her, then you try it out on me?"
S04E18,GEORGE,And... and anybody can do this?
S04E18,ELAINE,Yup.
S04E18,GEORGE,"Helping people... Of course. Of course! It makes perfect sense! How could I *not* be doing this!? I am gonna help somebody, Dammit!"
S04E18,ELAINE,[To Jerry] What about you?
S04E18,JERRY,"Nah, it's not for me."
S04E18,ELAINE,"Jerry, if anybody should be doing this, it's you."
S04E18,GEORGE,What *kind* of a person are you?
S04E18,JERRY,I think I'm pretty much like you-- only successful.
S04E18,AGENCY REP,This is a wonderful thing you're doing. They're so grateful just to have someone to talk to. And I can tell you that everyone who participates finds the experience extremely rewarding.
S04E18,GEORGE,"Well, I feel better already. I'm feelin' like a good person."
S04E18,AGENCY REP,Good luck.
S04E18,JERRY,Thank you.
S04E18,GEORGE,"Hey, what's your guy's name again?"
S04E18,JERRY,Fields. Sidney Fields. *87* years old. *87*. How about your guy?
S04E18,GEORGE,Ben Cantwell. 85. Huh... You think we'll make it to that age?
S04E18,JERRY,*We*? No.
S04E18,KRAMER,"So what's up, Diggity Dog?"
S04E18,JERRY,George and I just signed up with the Senior Citizen's Volunteer Agency. Same thing Elaine's doing.
S04E18,KRAMER,"Oh, that's too bad. Now don't say I didn't try to warn you."
S04E18,JERRY,What're you talkin' about?
S04E18,KRAMER,"Oh, Jerry, I'm *surprised* at you!"
S04E18,JERRY,What?
S04E18,KRAMER,"It's a *con*. These agencies are usually a front for some money laundering scheme. Or they're bunko artists; bilkin' people out of their life savings, oh *yeah*."
S04E18,JERRY,Where do you *get* this?
S04E18,KRAMER,"The alternative media, Jerry. That's where you hear the truth."
S04E18,NEWMAN,Kramer?! Kramer!? Where are you? Kramer!?! Kramer!!?
S04E18,KRAMER,I'm in here. C'mon...
S04E18,JERRY,"Hello, *Newman*..."
S04E18,NEWMAN,"Jerry, George. [To Kramer] So, did you ask him about the records?"
S04E18,KRAMER,Well--
S04E18,JERRY,What records?
S04E18,KRAMER,"Well, Newman and I are going partners selling used records."
S04E18,NEWMAN,You know Ron's Records down on Bleeker? They pay big cash for used records!
S04E18,KRAMER,"Yeah, so we thought if you had any of those big, y'know, old-fashioned useless records, y'know, just... lyin' around--"
S04E18,KRAMER,"Y'know, we'd take them off your hands, free of charge."
S04E18,GEORGE,"Let me ask you something. What do you do for a living, Newman?"
S04E18,NEWMAN,I'm a United States postal worker.
S04E18,GEORGE,Aren't those the guys that always go crazy and come back with a gun and shoot everybody?
S04E18,NEWMAN,Sometimes...
S04E18,JERRY,Why *is* that?
S04E18,NEWMAN,"Because the mail never stops. It just keeps coming and coming and coming, there's never a let-up. It's relentless. Every day it piles up more and more and more! And you gotta get it out but the more you get it out the more it keeps coming in. And then the bar code reader breaks and it's *Publisher's Clearing House* day!!!"
S04E18,RON,I'll give you five bucks.
S04E18,KRAMER,Five bucks???
S04E18,NEWMAN,"Well, you know how much those records are worth!?"
S04E18,RON,"Yeah, I do... Fi' dollars."
S04E18,NEWMAN,Those records are worth more than five dollars!
S04E18,KRAMER,[In Newman's ear] He's gyppin' us...
S04E18,NEWMAN,You're gyppin' us!
S04E18,RON,"Well, whattya got here, y'know, you got ""Don Ho Live At Honolulu"", you got ""Jerry Vale Sings Italian Love Songs"" you got Sergio Mendes, now come on..."
S04E18,KRAMER,"Wait, wait, wait... Sergio Mendes has a cult following."
S04E18,NEWMAN,They follow him like a cult.
S04E18,KRAMER,He can't even walk down the street in South America...
S04E18,RON,"Look, that's his problem, alright? Now you don't like it, too bad."
S04E18,KRAMER,[In Newman's ear] I don't like it...
S04E18,NEWMAN,I don't like it.
S04E18,RON,"Well, then get the Hell out of my store, alright? You bring me something decent, I'll give you some money."
S04E18,KRAMER,"[In Newman's ear] Alright, well be back, jack."
S04E18,NEWMAN,"Alright, well be back... *jack*!"
S04E18,JERRY,"Hi, I'm Jerry Seinfeld, the agency sent me."
S04E18,HOUSEKEEPER,Agency?
S04E18,JERRY,"Yeah, is this Sid Field's residence?"
S04E18,HOUSEKEEPER,Sid Fields.
S04E18,SID,What the *Hell* is it?
S04E18,JERRY,Mr. Fields?
S04E18,SID,What!?!
S04E18,JERRY,"Hi, I'm Jerry Seinfeld, the agency sent me."
S04E18,SID,Agency? What agency? The *CIA*?
S04E18,JERRY,"No, no, the--"
S04E18,SID,Who let you in here?
S04E18,JERRY,"The woman, she--"
S04E18,SID,"Oh *her*. She *steals* from me. Steals my money. She says she doesn't speak English. My *ass* she doesn't speak English. Plays that freakin' ""voo-doo"" music, tries to hypnotize me. She thinks she's gonna turn me into a zombie and then rob me blind. Well, I wasn't born yesterday. I may drop dead today, but I sure as Hell wasn't born yesterday. Now get the Hell out of my house..."
S04E18,JERRY,"Mr. Fields, I'm here to spend some time with you."
S04E18,SID,"Oh, really. Are you the boyfriend? I know she's got a boyfriend. Are you going to *kill* me? I'm an old man for crying out loud, you gonna kill an old man, you coward?!? [Jerry gets out card]"
S04E18,JERRY,"No, Mr. Field, look, really I'm--"
S04E18,SID,I can't read that you fool...
S04E18,JERRY,What's all this stuff?
S04E18,SID,Trash. Garbage.
S04E18,JERRY,You're throwin' this out??
S04E18,SID,"I believe that's what you do with garbage, you idiot."
S04E18,"(You can make out the albums pretty clearly. One is an apparent K-Tel ""classic""","""22 Explosive Hits"", I don't know the other one. Anyone? I believe ""The Beatles"" (The White Album) is there also.)"
S04E18,JERRY,You don't want any of this?
S04E18,SID,"Well if I wanted it I wouldn't be throwing it away, *Ein-stein*."
S04E18,JERRY,You know I have some friends who would really like to have these.
S04E18,SID,"Well, take it. I'm sure as Hell not going to give it to my family."
S04E18,JERRY,"Well, do you want to go out for a walk, get a cup of coffee..."
S04E18,SID,With you? I'd rather be dead.
S04E18,JERRY,"Well, maybe I'll get goin' then. I just remembered I got an appointment to get my, um, tonsils out."
S04E18,SID,"Good. Thank God. Good riddance. [pause] Oh listen, before you go, would you mind changing my diaper? HAA!!"
S04E18,BEN,"No, I feel great for 85."
S04E18,GEORGE,"Y'know the average life span for an American male is like, 72. You're really... kinda pushin' the envelope there."
S04E18,BEN,I'm not afraid of dyin'. I never think about it.
S04E18,GEORGE,"You don't? Boy, I think about it a lot. I think about it at my age. Imagine how much I'll be thinkin' about it at your age. All I'll do is keep thinkin' about it until it drives me insane..."
S04E18,BEN,I'm grateful for every moment I have.
S04E18,GEORGE,"Grateful? How can you be grateful when you're *so* close to the end? When you know that any second-- Poof! Bamm-O! It can all be over. I mean you're not stupid, you can read the handwriting on the wall. It's a matter of simple arithmetic, for Gods sake..."
S04E18,BEN,I guess I just don't care.
S04E18,GEORGE,What are you talking about? How can you sit there and look me in the eye and tell that me you're not worried?! Don't you have any *sense*?!! Don't you have a brain!? Are you so completely senile that you don't know what you're talkin about Anymore!!?!
S04E18,GEORGE,"Wait a second, where are you going?"
S04E18,BEN,Life's too short to waste on you.
S04E18,GEORGE,"Wait a minute, please--"
S04E18,BEN,Get out of my way...
S04E18,GEORGE,"But Mr. Cantwell, you... you owe me for the soup..."
S04E18,ELAINE,Mrs. Oliver?
S04E18,MRS. O,Yes my dear.
S04E18,ELAINE,Ooh!
S04E18,MRS. O,What's the trouble? Are you alright?
S04E18,ELAINE,Yeah. Yeah. Yes. Yeah.
S04E18,MRS. O,"It's my goiter, isn't it?"
S04E18,ELAINE,Did you say goiter? What goiter?
S04E18,MRS. O,This football-shaped lump jutting out the side of my neck.
S04E18,ELAINE,"Oh, *that* goiter. Hey... Heh heh heh... Whaddya know..."
S04E18,MRS. O,Does it bother you?
S04E18,ELAINE,"Bother me? Oh, phhbt... Why would a little goiter like that bother me? No, not a bit. It's nothing. It's nothin', it's um, in fact, it's um, it's very distinctive, y'know? Um, I mean you want to know something? I, I wish I had one. [pause] Really."
S04E18,JERRY,"C'mon Elaine, it's just a goiter..."
S04E18,ELAINE,"I don't know what I'm going to do. I can't look the woman in the face. I mean I keep thinkin' that that goiter's gonna start talkin' to me... You'd think they'd mention that before they send you over there ""Oh, by the way, this woman *almost* has a second head"". But no, no, I didn't get any goiter information."
S04E18,JERRY,"They really should mention that in the breakdown height, weight, goiter."
S04E18,ELAINE,Y'know you try to do some good. You want to be a good person but this is too much to ask.
S04E18,JERRY,"Yeah, well, I'll tell ya, I'd rather talk to a goiter with a nice disposition than the nut they sent me to."
S04E18,ELAINE,"Hey Georgie, what happened with your guy?"
S04E18,GEORGE,I don't think it's gonna work out...
S04E18,JERRY,Whattya mean?
S04E18,GEORGE,He fired me.
S04E18,JERRY,He fired you?!?
S04E18,ELAINE,*How* do you get fired from a volunteer job?
S04E18,GEORGE,I dunno. I was just talking to the man and he walked out on me!
S04E18,JERRY,"Well, I dunno about you two, but I'm quitting. I hate my guy. He's a mean, mean guy."
S04E18,ELAINE,I wish I could quit...
S04E18,JERRY,So quit!
S04E18,GEORGE,"Yeah, I'm a great quitter. It's one of the few things I do well. I come form a long line of quitters. My father was a quitter, my grandfather was a quitter... I was raised to give up."
S04E18,KRAMER,"Well, here's your *albums* [Journey ""Escape"" is on top, BTW...]"
S04E18,JERRY,What happened?
S04E18,NEWMAN,Five dollars. He offered us *five* dollars.
S04E18,KRAMER,"Hey, what kind of stuff are you listening to? You *embarrassed* me at that store."
S04E18,NEWMAN,That guy thought we were a couple of total squares.
S04E18,JERRY,"Oh yeah, you and your *Sergio Mendes*..."
S04E18,KRAMER,"Hey, hey, hey, hey, that guy can't even go to the bathroom in South America!"
S04E18,JERRY,"Well you shoulda seen the pile of albums this old guy I was visiting today was throwing away Sinatra, Duke Ellington, Al Jolson, Benny Goodman..."
S04E18,KRAMER,"Wait, wait, wait, now... He's throwin them out??"
S04E18,JERRY,"Yeah, and then I asked him if my friend could have them and he said yeah."
S04E18,KRAMER,Okay...
S04E18,NEWMAN,[In Kramer's ear] The old coot's sittin' on a mountain of gold!
S04E18,KRAMER,Yeah...
S04E18,JERRY,But you're going to have to go get em. I'm not carryin' them all.
S04E18,KRAMER,"Yeah, but you've gotta come with us."
S04E18,JERRY,"Yeah, I'm goin' there today. In fact you should see this house keeper he's got. She's from Senegal [and, ala Carson] Wild, Wild, Stuff..."
S04E18,GEORGE,Senegal?
S04E18,GEORGE,So you don't speak *any* English at all?
S04E18,HOUSEKEEPER,English? No.
S04E18,SID,"Hey, what are those bums doin' back there?"
S04E18,JERRY,Well you said they could come and take the records.
S04E18,SID,It's like watchin' a couple of hyenas goin' through the garbage.
S04E18,GEORGE,You don't speak *any* English?
S04E18,HOUSEKEEPER,No English.
S04E18,GEORGE,I would like to dip my bald head in oil and rub it all over your body. [No reaction] You don't understand! It's a miracle! You don't understand because you don't speak English!
S04E18,JERRY,So Mr. Fields I just don't know if this arrangement is--
S04E18,SID,"Hey, I don't like what's goin' on around here. I want all you bums outta here."
S04E18,KRAMER,"Now calm down, Mr. Fields..."
S04E18,SID,Now don't tell me to calm down... Get your hands off of me! Why you little...
S04E18,KRAMER,Oooow! He's biting me!
S04E18,SID,My teeth! My teeth!
S04E18,JERRY,Where's his teeth! Where's his teeth!
S04E18,GEORGE,I thought I saw something fly over here...
S04E18,JERRY,Well turn the light on...
S04E18,JERRY,That's the garbage disposal!
S04E18,SID,My teeth! You idiots!!!
S04E18,MRS. O,And we would take long automobile trips--
S04E18,ELAINE,"Oh, well, that sounds like a lot of fun..."
S04E18,MRS. O,Staring out the window--
S04E18,ELAINE,Uh huh...
S04E18,MRS. O,You'd see a long view of rolling pastures and--
S04E18,ELAINE,"Well, that'll get you goin' right there..."
S04E18,MRS. O,"Big, roaming cows--"
S04E18,ELAINE,"Cows, well that's fascinating..."
S04E18,MRS. O,That's when I began my affair with Mohandas.
S04E18,ELAINE,What?
S04E18,MRS. O,Mohandas.
S04E18,ELAINE,Ghandhi?
S04E18,MRS. O,"Oh, the *passion*. The *forbidden pleasure*--"
S04E18,ELAINE,"You had an affair with Ghandhi? MRS. O He used to dip his bald head in oil and rub it all over my body. Here, look... [shows Elaine a picture of the two together]"
S04E18,ELAINE,"Oh, my God... The Mohatma?"
S04E18,RON,Twenty bucks.
S04E18,NEWMAN,Twenty bucks?!? Are you out of your mind?
S04E18,RON,"Well, take it or leave it."
S04E18,NEWMAN,"Take it or leave it!? We got *Al Jolson* here, *Al Jolson*!!"
S04E18,RON,"Now what the Hell do I care about Al Jolson. I'd just assume her you sing ""Mammy"". Heh heh heh..."
S04E18,KRAMER,[In Newman's ear] This guy's nothin' but a piece of crap...
S04E18,NEWMAN,You are nothing but a piece of crap.
S04E18,RON,Pardon me?
S04E18,KRAMER,[In Newman's ear] A piece of crap...
S04E18,NEWMAN,A piece of crap.
S04E18,KRAMER,[In Newman's ear] I find you extremely ugly...
S04E18,NEWMAN,I find you extremely ugly.
S04E18,RON,*Do* you?
S04E18,KRAMER,[In Newman's ear] You emit a foul and unpleasant odour...
S04E18,NEWMAN,You emit a foul and unpleasant odour.
S04E18,RON,"Oh, is that right?"
S04E18,KRAMER,[In Newman's ear] I *loathe* you...
S04E18,NEWMAN,I *loathe* you.
S04E18,RON,That's it. Get out of my store!
S04E18,KRAMER,[In Newman's ear] Make us.
S04E18,NEWMAN,Make us!
S04E18,RON,"Oh, I'll make you!"
S04E18,AGENCY REP,Do you realize how irresponsible this is? Our agency's sole purpose is to care for senior citizens. And in one fell swoop you've single- handedly destroyed our reputation.
S04E18,JERRY,"Yes, but--"
S04E18,JERRY,[Into intercom] Yes?
S04E18,TIM,"It's Tim Fields, Mr. Fields' son."
S04E18,JERRY,"Alright, c'mon up."
S04E18,JERRY,"[To Rep] I dunno what happened, we were just trying to take him to the dentist."
S04E18,AGENCY REP,Why were you taking him to the dentist?
S04E18,JERRY,"Um, well, his false teeth got mangled up in the garbage disposal--"
S04E18,AGENCY REP,What were his false teeth doing in the garbage disposal?
S04E18,JERRY,"Well, after he bit my friend--"
S04E18,AGENCY REP,Bit your friend?!
S04E18,TIM,What the *Hell* is going on here? How do you *lose* a human being?!
S04E18,JERRY,"I, I'm sorry."
S04E18,TIM,And who were these other people. What were they doing in the apartment!?
S04E18,JERRY,"Well, I brought them up there to take his records--"
S04E18,TIM,Take his *records*? Do you realize how valuable that record collection is?
S04E18,KRAMER,Hey.
S04E18,JERRY,There you are. Did you find him?
S04E18,KRAMER,"No, y'know we took the old man's records over to Ron's and he tried to *screw* us so we got in a fight."
S04E18,NEWMAN,It was a real melee.
S04E18,KRAMER,"Yeah, a real brouhaha..."
S04E19,SIDRA,"Oh, hi Jerry."
S04E19,JERRY,"Hi, Sidra. I usually last about ten minutes on a Stairmaster. Unless of course there's someone stretching in front of me in a leotard, then I can go an hour."
S04E19,SIDRA (amused),Really.
S04E19,JERRY,"Oh, yeah. That's why they call it a Stairmaster. You get up there and you stare."
S04E19,SIDRA (stepping off),"Well, I'm done. I think I'm gonna go take a sauna."
S04E19,JERRY,"Alright, I'll see you Thursday night, right?"
S04E19,SIDRA,Thursday night.
S04E19,JERRY,Alright.
S04E19,ELAINE,Good workout?
S04E19,"JERRY (mimics smoking an ""after sex cigarette"")",Tremendous workout.
S04E19,ELAINE,That's a pretty girl.
S04E19,JERRY,Tremendous girl.
S04E19,ELAINE,She's the one you went out with last night?
S04E19,JERRY,Yeah. I really like her.
S04E19,ELAINE,"You know, uh...they're fake."
S04E19,JERRY,What? Don't say that!
S04E19,ELAINE,Nah! They're fake!
S04E19,JERRY,How do you know?
S04E19,ELAINE,I can tell. You know how you're always bragging how you can spot a lesbian?
S04E19,JERRY,"I'm not bragging, I happen to have a very keen lesbian eye. (A woman walks by Jerry and Elaine.) Hi, how ya doin.' (Jerry jerks a thumb at the woman to confirm his talent. Elaine is skeptical.)"
S04E19,ELAINE,"Oh, right. C'mon, don't you think they seem a bit too perfect?"
S04E19,JERRY,"Yes, they do!"
S04E19,ELAINE,I never knew you were so into breasts. I thought you were a leg man.
S04E19,JERRY,A leg man? Why would I be a leg man? I don't need legs. I have legs. Have you ever seen her naked in the locker room?
S04E19,ELAINE,No.
S04E19,JERRY,"Oh, well, then I can't accept your testimony. Maybe if you had seen her naked."
S04E19,ELAINE,I don't want to see her naked.
S04E19,JERRY,"Well, I do."
S04E19,ELAINE,"Well, that's your problem."
S04E19,JERRY,"Look, you made the allegation. The least you could do is follow up."
S04E19,ELAINE,"Jerry, what am I gonna do? I'm gonna go in there and spy on her in the sauna?"
S04E19,JERRY,Yes! Go in there! Do a little investigative journalism. I need to know!
S04E19,ELAINE,But a few more dates and you can find out for yourself!
S04E19,JERRY,"Don't be so sure. Look at George - he's on his ninth date with Betsy, he still hasn't gotten anywhere with her."
S04E19,ELAINE,What's his problem?
S04E19,JERRY,"Well, every time he tries to make a move, something screws up. Like on their last date, they were on the couch, but she was sitting on his wrong side."
S04E19,ELAINE,Wrong side?
S04E19,JERRY,"Yeah, she was on his right side. He can't make a move with his left hand. Can't go left."
S04E19,ELAINE,He can't go left.
S04E19,JERRY,"No! I'm lefty, can't go right. What about women? Do they go left or right?"
S04E19,ELAINE,"Nah, we just play defense."
S04E19,GEORGE,Can I ask you a question? Would you mind switching seats?
S04E19,BETSY,"Oh, actually, I really prefer to sit here. I don't hear very well out of this ear (points to her right ear) so, I always try to sit to the right of people."
S04E19,GEORGE,I'll shout.
S04E19,BETSY,"Well, I really think I feel more comfortable here."
S04E19,GEORGE,"C'mon, c'mon...(stands up and physically rolls Betsy to the left side of the couch.) See, now, is that so bad?"
S04E19,BETSY,What? (The phone rings.)
S04E19,GEORGE (attempting to make a move),"No, no, the machine'll get it..."
S04E19,BETSY,"No, no, it's not on..."
S04E19,GEORGE,They'll call back.
S04E19,BETSY,"But George, what if it's an emergency?"
S04E19,GEORGE,"In the whole world right now, there's maybe three emergencies. Why would you think, on this entire planet, that you're one of those three?"
S04E19,BETSY,"George, please. (Gets up and answers the phone.) Hello? What? (shocked) Oh my god!"
S04E19,GEORGE,"Alright, maybe four."
S04E19,ELAINE's brain,"Boy, I'm really sweatin.' Good sweat, beads of sweat...sweatin' bullets. (Notices Sidra.) Look at her. I don't need to see her naked to know those aren't real. Why does she need to tie the towel around her? She's got a rack on her chest. (Sidra takes her towel off and lies down.) Oh god! Sidra's takin' the towel off! (Looks at Sidra's chest.) Whoa, doctor! That's it, I knew it! I knew it, they're definitely fake."
S04E19,BETSY,"So, when's the funeral? Well, Aunt Clarice was so ill, I guess it was really a blessing. (George, on the couch behind Betsy, is impatiently waiting for her to get off the phone so he can continue putting the moves on her. He shrugs, and crosses himself.) Yeah, I'll fly home as soon as I can. (George waves goodbye, and mimics a plane flying through the air with his hand.) O.k. You, too. Get some sleep. (Betsy looks at George, and he manufactures a completely phony look of sorrow.)"
S04E19,JERRY,You're sure?
S04E19,ELAINE,Positive! This chick's playin' with confederate money.
S04E19,JERRY,"Well then, that's it. That's the end of that."
S04E19,ELAINE,What? Just 'cause of that?
S04E19,JERRY,Just 'cause of that? It's like finding out Mickey Mantle corked his bat!
S04E19,ELAINE,"Oh, come on! You've dated women with nosejobs, what's the difference?"
S04E19,JERRY,"You don't touch the nose! You don't aspire to reach the nose. You don't unhook anything to get to a nose, and no man has ever tried to look up a woman's nostril."
S04E19,ELAINE,"You've put a lot of thought into this, haven't you?"
S04E19,JERRY,"Well, I take it very seriously."
S04E19,ELAINE,"You know, sometimes when I think you're the shallowest man I've ever met, you somehow manage to drain a little more out of the pool."
S04E19,KRAMER,Hey.
S04E19,JERRY,"Hey. You know, I do kinda wonder what fake breast feel like."
S04E19,KRAMER,"Well, I know what they feel like."
S04E19,JERRY,You? How do you know?
S04E19,KRAMER,"Well, I lived in Los Angeles for three months."
S04E19,ELAINE (laughs),I thought you hated Los Angeles.
S04E19,KRAMER,"I do! I just miss the warm weather, y'know? Jeez. Oh man, I wish I could get away."
S04E19,JERRY,Real busy now down at the office?
S04E19,KRAMER,No. Huh? You know who I saw at the health club? Salman Rushdie.
S04E19,ELAINE (laughing),"Yeah right, Salman Rushdie. Yeah well, I can see that - you got five millions Moslems after you, you wanna stay in pretty good shape."
S04E19,GEORGE,I know what the problem is - I like her too much. That's why I can't make a move.
S04E19,JERRY,You put her on a pedestal.
S04E19,KRAMER,I put them on a dental chair.
S04E19,JERRY,He puts 'em on a dental chair.
S04E19,GEORGE,I'm not her boyfriend. I want to be her boyfriend.
S04E19,KRAMER,Whoo. It's like a sauna in here.
S04E19,GEORGE,That's funny. You're a funny guy.
S04E19,JERRY,"Yeah, funny. Yeah, I never heard that before. (To George) So, you goin' to the funeral?"
S04E19,GEORGE,"Why, you think I should?"
S04E19,JERRY,"What, are you kidding? It's a golden opportunity to advance the relationship. She's crying, you put your arm around her and console her...you're the consolation guy!"
S04E19,GEORGE,I'm the consolation guy...?
S04E19,KRAMER,Consolation Guy is big.
S04E19,JERRY,Her aunt dying is the best thing that ever happened to you.
S04E19,KRAMER,It's like ten dates in one shot.
S04E19,JERRY,This confers upon you instant boyfriend status. The family's there...you're taking care of things...you're gettin' the sandwiches...you're the rock!
S04E19,GEORGE,"It's in Detroit though, it's an expensive flight."
S04E19,KRAMER,"Why don't you get a ""death in the family"" fare?"
S04E19,GEORGE,What?
S04E19,KRAMER,"You go to the airlines, you tell them you got a death in the family? They give you 50% off the fare."
S04E19,GEORGE,Really?
S04E19,KRAMER,"In fact, listen...I'll go down there with ya. You know, we'll tell them there's a death in my family, you buy the ticket, I'll split it...then I'll get the bonus miles and you'll get to Detroit for a quarter of the price!"
S04E19,ELAINE's brain,"Boy, I'm gettin' a good sweat here. Great sweat, good beads. Nice beads."
S04E19,ELAINE's brain,"Ah, look who's here. ""Silicon Valley."""
S04E19,SIDRA (to her friend),"So anyway, we go out on one date, he asks me out for a second, then out of nowhere he cancels the date and says he doesn't want to see me again."
S04E19,ELAINE,"Uh...sorry, I couldn't help overhearing."
S04E19,SIDRA,"Oh, that's o.k."
S04E19,ELAINE,Did he give you a reason?
S04E19,SIDRA,Yeah. He's going back to his old girlfriend.
S04E19,ELAINE,Really?
S04E19,SIDRA,He said she's mentally ill. He's one of those guys who is obsessed with neatness and order? Everything has gotta be just so. He would have made a great Nazi.
S04E19,ELAINE,"Hey, does he ever talk about Superman?"
S04E19,SIDRA,Yes! How did you know?
S04E19,ELAINE,"Oh, I know the type."
S04E19,SIDRA,So you can relate?
S04E19,ELAINE,"Oh, yeah."
S04E19,SIDRA (sits across from Elaine and takes her towel off),"You know, I've seen you around the club. My name's Sidra. This is Marcy."
S04E19,ELAINE,"Oh, hi. I'm Elaine. (Gets up to shake Sidra's hand, but stumbles and falls ""right into them."")"
S04E19,ELAINE,"So anyway, I stood up to shake her hand, then suddenly I lost my balance and I fell right into her."
S04E19,JERRY,You fell on her?
S04E19,ELAINE,I touched 'em.
S04E19,JERRY,You what?
S04E19,ELAINE,I...touched...'em.
S04E19,JERRY,You touched 'em?!
S04E19,ELAINE,"I needed them to help me break my fall! If it hadn't been for them, I could have really injured myself!"
S04E19,JERRY,Wow.
S04E19,ELAINE,Anyway...they're real.
S04E19,JERRY,Excuse me?!
S04E19,ELAINE,I think they might be real.
S04E19,JERRY,"Oh, what do you know, you have no breast touching experience."
S04E19,ELAINE,I've touched mine!
S04E19,JERRY,So have I.
S04E19,ELAINE,"Oh, right...I forgot. (smiles)"
S04E19,JERRY,"Anyway, touching two breasts doesn't make you an expert."
S04E19,ELAINE,"Alright, well anyway, I think they're real. And if they are, I must say they are...spectacular."
S04E19,JERRY,"Aw, what are you doin' to me? (puts his head down on the counter.)"
S04E19,GEORGE (to clerk),"You see, my friend here, his aunt passed away last night."
S04E19,CLERK (to Kramer),"Oh, I'm very sorry."
S04E19,KRAMER,"I saw her last week, she looked healthy and peaceful, but...she knew..."
S04E19,CLERK,You poor thing!
S04E19,KRAMER (breaking into tears),I...I...
S04E19,GEORGE,"You don't think you can buy the ticket yourself...? No, there, there...you sit, and I'll purchase the ticket for you."
S04E19,CLERK,You're a good friend.
S04E19,GEORGE,I understand you offer a 50%-off 'bereavement' fare...?
S04E19,CLERK,"Yes, all you have to do is pay the full fare now, then return to any one of our counters with a copy of the death certificate, and we'll refund half your fare."
S04E19,GEORGE,The death certificate?
S04E19,CLERK,"Yes, yes, we do need documentation or you know, people could take advantage."
S04E19,GEORGE,What kind of a sick person would do a thing like that?
S04E19,CLERK,I know! But it happens.
S04E19,GEORGE,"You want my friend to ask his uncle, a man who just lost his wife of 44 years, for a death certificate so that he can save a few bucks on a flight?"
S04E19,CLERK,That would be $387 round-trip.
S04E19,KRAMER (in a perfectly normal tone of voice),"Alright, so you'll need my frequent flyer number, huh?"
S04E19,CLERK,Yes.
S04E19,JERRY,"I don't know, one minute you say they're fake, the next minute you think they're real...I don't know what to believe!"
S04E19,ELAINE,"Hey, of the two of us, I'm the only one who's touched 'em."
S04E19,JERRY,"But you were just grabbing on to them to save your life. If you were drowning and I threw you a life preserver, you think you could tell me if it was an inflatable?"
S04E19,ELAINE,I wouldn't have said anything if I knew you were going to stop seeing her!
S04E19,JERRY,"Well, I don't mind someone with a phony personality, but I gotta draw the line somewhere."
S04E19,KRAMER,Hey!
S04E19,JERRY,Hey. George off to Detroit?
S04E19,KRAMER,"Yep! And, in two days, I'm off to Puerto Rico."
S04E19,ELAINE,"Hey Kramer, by the way, I saw that guy at the health club...that is not Salman Rushdie."
S04E19,KRAMER,Pffft - wrong.
S04E19,JERRY,There's Sidra.
S04E19,KRAMER,There's Salman.
S04E19,JERRY,Where?
S04E19,KRAMER,Talkin' to that woman.
S04E19,JERRY,Talkin' to Sidra?
S04E19,KRAMER,"If that's Sidra, she's talkin' to Salman."
S04E19,JERRY,I don't think that's Salman.
S04E19,KRAMER,"Well, I don't think they're real."
S04E19,JERRY,"If that's Rushdie, they're real."
S04E19,KRAMER,"If they're real, that's Rushdie."
S04E19,JERRY,"Well, I gotta know - I'm talkin' to Sidra."
S04E19,KRAMER,"I gotta know, I'm talkin' to Salman."
S04E19,KRAMER,"It's like a sauna in here, huh? I feel like I'm...back at the desert."
S04E19,"""SALMAN""",You've lived in the desert?
S04E19,KRAMER,"Oh, yeah. Yeah, I've uh...I've spent a little time in the Mideast. You ever been to the Mideast?"
S04E19,"""SALMAN""","Yes, I've been there."
S04E19,KRAMER,My name's Kramer.
S04E19,"""SALMAN"" (shakes Kramer's hand)","Sal Bass. Pleased to meet you, Kramer."
S04E19,KRAMER,"So, uh...what kind of work do you do?"
S04E19,"""SALMAN""",I'm a writer.
S04E19,BETSY (to Aunt May),Have you met my boyfriend George?
S04E19,AUNT MAY,No! (shakes George's hand.)
S04E19,BETSY,"George, this is Aunt May, and Father Jessup. Oh, and that's my brother, Timmy. (Timmy smiles thinly.) This is my boyfriend, George."
S04E19,AUNT MAY,"Oh George, how nice of you to come all this way."
S04E19,GEORGE,"Well, I'm the boyfriend. Otherwise, what's the point of being the boyfriend? This is where you have to be when you're the boyfriend."
S04E19,AUNT MAY,"Betsy, dear, have you had anything to eat?"
S04E19,BETSY,I'm not very hungry.
S04E19,AUNT MAY,They have some very nice snacks.
S04E19,FATHER JESSUP,I'm about to get myself a snack.
S04E19,GEORGE,"Oh, no, no, no...you sit right here...I will get you a nice snack."
S04E19,FATHER JESSUP,This is my third wake this month. It never gets any easier.
S04E19,GEORGE (loading up his plate with sandwiches),"Well, losing a loved is, uh...I mean, forget about it. (Starts wolfing down the sandwiches.)"
S04E19,FATHER JESSUP,"You seem to be of great comfort to Betsy, we're very appreciative."
S04E19,GEORGE,"Oh - comfort, schmomfort. Listen, Father, can I ask you a question? In a terrible time like this...who would I get the death certificate from?"
S04E19,KRAMER,C'mon Jerry!
S04E19,JERRY,"Oh, how can you be so sure?"
S04E19,KRAMER,"Jerry, are you blind? He's a writer. He said his name was Sal Bass. Bass, Jerry! Instead of salmon, he went with bass! He just substituted one fish for another!"
S04E19,JERRY,"Look, you idiot, first of all, it's Salman, not salmon!"
S04E19,KRAMER,"Jerry, Jerry, you're missing the big picture!"
S04E19,JERRY,"Alright, maybe it is, but listen, I gotta get ready - Sidra's coming over in a few minutes, so if you don't mind..."
S04E19,KRAMER,"What, did you ask her?"
S04E19,JERRY,I'm gonna find out tonight.
S04E19,KRAMER (nods),"Oh, yes indeed..."
S04E19,DR. ALLENWOOD,Why do you need a death certificate?
S04E19,GEORGE,"Well, Dr, Allenwood, uh...I was hoping to compile an - admittedly, rudimentary - scrapbook of her life. Something that Betsy could have, and hold onto."
S04E19,DR. ALLENWOOD,"Well, I suppose I could make a copy of it."
S04E19,GEORGE,"Oh, that would be wonderful."
S04E19,DR. ALLENWOOD,"It was very nice meeting you, George."
S04E19,GEORGE,Likewise.
S04E19,TIMMY,What are you doing?
S04E19,GEORGE,What?
S04E19,TIMMY,Did...did you just double-dip that chip?
S04E19,GEORGE,Excuse me?
S04E19,TIMMY,You double-dipped the chip!
S04E19,GEORGE,"""Double-dipped""? What are you talking about?"
S04E19,TIMMY,You dipped the chip. You took a bite. (points at the dip) And you dipped again.
S04E19,GEORGE,So...?
S04E19,TIMMY,"That's like putting your whole mouth right in the dip! From now on, when you take a chip - just take one dip and end it!"
S04E19,GEORGE,"Well, I'm sorry, Timmy...but I don't dip that way. (takes a chip.)"
S04E19,TIMMY,"Oh, you don't, huh?"
S04E19,GEORGE,No. (dips the chip) You dip the way you want to dip...(bites the chip) I'll dip the way I want to dip. (dips the chip again.)
S04E19,TIMMY,Gimme the chip! (Grabs George and the chip goes flying.) Gimme the chip! (They struggle in front of the snack table.)
S04E19,SIDRA,"I don't know what I'm doing here, I must be crazy. (Moves to the couch and sits on the left side. Jerry tries to run over and beat her to it, but doesn't make it. He sits down on the right side.)"
S04E19,JERRY,"Hey, would you mind switching seats?"
S04E19,SIDRA,Why?
S04E19,JERRY,"Oh, I don't know...I just like sitting to the left of people, makes me feel like I'm driving."
S04E19,SIDRA,O.K....(they switch places.)
S04E19,JERRY,How ya doin'?
S04E19,SIDRA,Good. How you doin'?
S04E19,JERRY,"Good, feel good...you know that Jayne Mansfield had some big breasts. Really big, huge...just coming out the top of her dress, they were like, chokin' her."
S04E19,SIDRA,I hear that's how she died.
S04E19,JERRY,"Have you noticed that women today are, you know, they seem...bigger."
S04E19,SIDRA,"Well, a lot of women are having them done."
S04E19,JERRY,Really?
S04E19,SIDRA,Yeah.
S04E19,JERRY,How do you like that.
S04E19,SIDRA,A lot of people ask me if I've had mine done.
S04E19,JERRY,"Aw, you know people."
S04E19,SIDRA,"It gets a little tiring, it's really none of their business."
S04E19,JERRY,"Oh, the nerve. You know, some people have asked me if you've uh, done that."
S04E19,SIDRA,What do you tell them?
S04E19,JERRY,Whatever you want me to tell them.
S04E19,SIDRA,"Well, I think you'll find out soon enough. (They prepare to kiss. There's a loud bang on the door.) Aren't you going to get that?"
S04E19,JERRY,No.
S04E19,SIDRA,What if it's an emergency?
S04E19,JERRY,"Oh, there's no emergency..."
S04E19,KRAMER (in hallway),"Jerry! C'mon, it's an emergency!"
S04E19,JERRY,"Excuse me. (Gets up and answers the door.) Alright, what is it? You're interrupting!"
S04E19,KRAMER,"Well, you know, I'm packing for Puerto Rico, I need to borrow your bathing suit."
S04E19,JERRY,This is an emergency? You need a bathing suit?
S04E19,KRAMER,"Well, I like yours."
S04E19,JERRY,"I don't know, my bathing suit? That's a little familiar, I don't want your...your boys down there."
S04E19,KRAMER,"C'mon, what's wrong with my boys?"
S04E19,JERRY,Your boys should stay in their neighborhood.
S04E19,KRAMER,"Alright, c'mon!"
S04E19,JERRY,Alright. It's in the top drawer. Hurry up. (Kramer goes to get the suit. Elaine enters.)
S04E19,ELAINE,"Hi, Jer."
S04E19,JERRY,"Oh, hi, Elaine."
S04E19,ELAINE,"Oh...hi, Sidra -"
S04E19,SIDRA,Hi...Elaine? (Kramer comes back into the living room.)
S04E19,JERRY (to Elaine),What are you doing here?
S04E19,ELAINE,I'm looking for Kramer.
S04E19,KRAMER,"Yeah, she was just showing me pictures of places I can visit when I go to Puerto Rico...you know, when you two went down there?"
S04E19,JERRY,"Oh. yeah. Alright. (pushes Kramer and Elaine out the door, then sits next to Sidra on the couch.) So, where were we?"
S04E19,SIDRA,I was just leaving.
S04E19,JERRY,"Right, you were leaving."
S04E19,SIDRA,I can't believe you sent a woman into the sauna to do that.
S04E19,JERRY,That was an accident!
S04E19,SIDRA,"I think you're both mentally ill. (leaves, then opens the door again.) And by the way...they're real, and they're spectacular. (Sidra leaves.)"
S04E19,BETSY,"Stop it, George! Get out! Get out! I never want to see you again!"
S04E19,DR. ALLENWOOD,Go back to New York! Get out!
S04E19,CLERK 2,"Alright sir, now all I need is a death certificate and you'll be on your way."
S04E19,GEORGE,"Well, you see, what happened was...the doctor - the very same doctor that was attending to my late aunt - suffered an untimely stroke, and lost the use of his right hand, so...obviously I was unable to get the death certificate. However, I do have this. (Reaches inside his coat and takes out a Polaroid photo.)"
S04E19,CLERK 2,What's this?
S04E19,GEORGE,That's a picture of me next to the coffin.
S04E19,CLERK 2,Nice try.
S04E19,GEORGE,"Not even close, huh?"
S04E20,JERRY,"You can't just *have* an adultery-- you *commit* adultery. And you can't even *commit* adultery unless you already *have* a commitment. So you have to make the commitment before you can even think about committing it. There's no commit without the commit. Then, once you commit, then you can commit the adultery. Then you can get caught, get divorced, lose your mind and they have you committed. But y'know some people actually *cheat* on the people that they're cheating with. Which is like, y'know, being in a hold up and then turning to the robber next to you and goin' Alright, gimme everything you have, too''."
S04E20,GEORGE,You met her at the supermarket? How did you do that?
S04E20,JERRY,(flips a roll of paper towels in the air) Produce section. *Very* provocative area. A lot of melons and shapes. Everyone's squeezing and smelling... It just happened.
S04E20,GEORGE,(laughs-hu) So when're you gonna see her?
S04E20,JERRY,Tonight.
S04E20,GEORGE,What's her name?
S04E20,JERRY,I... don't... know...
S04E20,GEORGE,How could you not know her name?
S04E20,JERRY,"I was a little nervous, I got distracted. It has something to do with a car, or a fish..."
S04E20,JERRY,Look at that. Why do I get bananas? They're good for *one* day...
S04E20,GEORGE,"Oh my God, I forgot to tell you. I got a letter today from the State Controller's Office. Y'know when I was going to public school back in Brooklyn, every week I used to put fifty cents in the Lincoln Savings Bank."
S04E20,JERRY,"Yeah, I did that too."
S04E20,GEORGE,"Yeah, You remember the, the little eh, bank book, there?"
S04E20,JERRY,Sure.
S04E20,GEORGE,"Alright, so I haven't put anything in it since sixth grade, I completely forgot about it. The State Controller's Office tracks me down. The interest has accumulated to 1,900 dollars. 1,900 dollars! They're sending me a cheque!"
S04E20,JERRY,Wow!
S04E20,GEORGE,"Hu-Yeah, interest. It's an amazing thing. You make money without doing anything..."
S04E20,JERRY,Y'know I have some friends who try and base their whole life on that principle.
S04E20,GEORGE,Really? Who?
S04E20,JERRY,Nobody you know...
S04E20,GEORGE,Maybe I'll go down to the track. Put it all on a horse...
S04E20,JERRY,Why don't you put it in the *bank*?
S04E20,GEORGE,The *bank*? This is *found* money. I want to *parlay* it. I wanna make a big score!
S04E20,JERRY,"*Oh*, you mean you wanna *lose* it..."
S04E20,KRAMER,"Yeah... All right....Ya got it, eh."
S04E20,JERRY,Yes I did.
S04E20,KRAMER,Yes.
S04E20,GEORGE,What's with the gloves?
S04E20,KRAMER,"Well, I'm staining my floors, y'know, I don't want to get my hands dirty..."
S04E20,GEORGE,"Huh. What, the whole apartment?"
S04E20,KRAMER,"The whole apartment. And I'm buying that fake wood wallpaper. I'm gonna surround myself in wood. It's gonna be like a log cabin. 'Cuz I *need* wood around me. Wood, Jerry [Snaps fingers]... Wood."
S04E20,JERRY,Wood is good.
S04E20,KRAMER,Definitely.
S04E20,JERRY,So we're still going to the health club to play racquetball right?
S04E20,KRAMER,"Yeah, yeah, whenever you're ready."
S04E20,JERRY,"O.K., soon as Elaine gets here."
S04E20,KRAMER,Yep.
S04E20,JERRY,"What, you rented ""Home Alone""?"
S04E20,GEORGE,Yeah.
S04E20,JERRY,I thought you saw that already...
S04E20,GEORGE,"No, I saw ""Home Alone II""."
S04E20,JERRY,"Oh, right... But you *hated* it!"
S04E20,GEORGE,"Well I was lost, I never saw the first one. By the way, you mind if I watch it here?"
S04E20,JERRY,What for?
S04E20,GEORGE,"Because if I watch it at my apartment I feel like I'm not doing anything. If I watch it here, I'm out of the house; I'm doing something."
S04E20,JERRY,All right.. Go ahead.
S04E20,JERRY,Yeah?
S04E20,ELAINE,"(on the intercom) It's me, are you ready to go?"
S04E20,JERRY,No. Come on up.
S04E20,KRAMER,I can't work with these!
S04E20,JERRY,What's wrong?
S04E20,KRAMER,"Well, you bought me dishwashing gloves. There's no *fine touch*..."
S04E20,JERRY,"You said ""gloves""..."
S04E20,KRAMER,"No, no, these are too thick. (removes the gloves/tosses them on the kitchen counter)"
S04E20,KRAMER,"Oooh, is that ""Home Alone""?"
S04E20,GEORGE,Yeah. The *original*.
S04E20,ELAINE,Hey Boys-O!
S04E20,EVERYONE,(in unison) Heyyyyyyyy.
S04E20,KRAMER,"Hey, how's it goin'?"
S04E20,ELAINE,Hello.
S04E20,JERRY,"(to Kramer) Hey (snaps fingers) get your stuff, let's get going."
S04E20,ELAINE,"Well wait a minute, there's a slight change of plans."
S04E20,JERRY,What?
S04E20,ELAINE,"eh, Remember Roy, the artist?"
S04E20,JERRY,"Oh, the ""triangle"" guy."
S04E20,ELAINE,"Yeah, exactly, the ""triangle"" guy."
S04E20,JERRY,"Yeah, you liked him. What happened with him?"
S04E20,ELAINE,"Yeah I did. He was very talented. He was, ah just, I don't know a little too..."
S04E20,JERRY,Artsy?
S04E20,ELAINE,Fat.
S04E20,JERRY,Oh. (unh - very quiet sigh)
S04E20,ELAINE,"He was a fat, starving artist, y'know. That's very rare."
S04E20,JERRY,Yeah.
S04E20,ELAINE,"Anyway, he's in the hospital, he's having surgery and I feel like should go visit him."
S04E20,JERRY,What's wrong with him?
S04E20,ELAINE,"Unh, something with his spleen. Anyway it'll just take five minutes, O.K., and then, the hospital is right on the way."
S04E20,KRAMER,"Yeah. (putting hand to his mouth, hatching a thought)"
S04E20,JERRY,All right we'll wait for you.
S04E20,KRAMER,"Yeah, maybe I can get some rubber gloves there huh, yea."
S04E20,ELAINE,"Listen, Jerry can you do me a favor? (clears throat) Could you, go into the room with me to visit him because ah, I don't want him to think that I'm, y'know... interested."
S04E20,JERRY,"Oh, you want me to pretend to be your boyfriend."
S04E20,ELAINE,Well...
S04E20,JERRY,Well I think I can do that. I believe I've played that role before to some critical acclaim.
S04E20,ELAINE,Aha ha ha (laugh)
S04E20,KRAMER,"All right, lets go."
S04E20,JERRY,All right (picks up his sports bag)
S04E20,KRAMER,Yep yep yep.
S04E20,ELAINE,What's with him?
S04E20,JERRY,Y'know a lot of people have asked that...
S04E20,ELAINE,Roy!
S04E20,ROY,*Elaine*! What a *surprise*. (sitting up)
S04E20,ELAINE,"(gasp) Oh, my *God*! I hardly recognize you! You look so..."
S04E20,ROY,"Yeah, ya know, I've lost some weight..."
S04E20,ELAINE,A *lot* of weight. (enthusiastically)
S04E20,ROY,I know.
S04E20,ELAINE,"Aha hu, You look *terrific*."
S04E20,ROY,Thank you. So do you.
S04E20,ELAINE,Ah hahaha hhuu ha (flirty laughing)
S04E20,ELAINE,"Ah, This is... uh... you *really* lost weight."
S04E20,ROY,Thank you.
S04E20,JERRY,"Jerry, uh, I'm the boyfriend. (puts his arm around Elaine's shoulder, but she shrugs it off twice)"
S04E20,HOSPITAL VOICEOVER,"Doctor Wittenberg, Outside call. Doctor Wittenberg, Outside call."
S04E20,WOMAN,AHAaaaaaaaaa! (scream)
S04E20,KRAMER,(a bit startled) Ahh.
S04E20,HOSPITAL VOICEOVER,"Doctor Wittenberg, Outside call."
S04E20,KRAMER,"Ah, the mother lode! (the door squeaks a bit as he pushes it open)"
S04E20,ELAINE,I can't believe it! You were *huge*! Like blubber! I couldn't even get my arms around you...
S04E20,ROY,"Yesss, I remember."
S04E20,ELAINE,"Ahahaha. Well that's the positive thing about getting sick, you get to lose weight."
S04E20,ROY,"Elaine, it wasn't the illness. It was you."
S04E20,ELAINE,Me?
S04E20,ROY,"(quietly- yeah) After you stopped seeing me, I was devastated. I couldn't eat for weeks."
S04E20,ELAINE,*Get* *out*!
S04E20,ROY,"Really, it's the truth."
S04E20,ELAINE,"Jerry, did you hear this? He couldn't eat for weeks..."
S04E20,JERRY,That's terrible...
S04E20,ELAINE,I had no idea I had that kind of effect on you.
S04E20,ROY,You did.
S04E20,JERRY,You know I can't get this *damn thing* to sleep. (about the Yo-Yo)
S04E20,ELAINE,"Now listen Roy, tell me something. When, are you gettin' out of here?"
S04E20,ROY,Next Thursday.
S04E20,ELAINE,"Okay, I'll tell you what. How about on Friday I take you out for a *big* meal because *you* are getting *too* thin..."
S04E20,JERRY,Honey... Aren't we going to the Poconos next Friday?
S04E20,ELAINE,No that's the week after.
S04E20,JERRY,"No, I believe it's next week."
S04E20,ELAINE,You're wrong.
S04E20,JERRY,No I'm not...
S04E20,ELAINE,Shut up...
S04E20,KRAMER,Pay dirt! (holding up the hand full of gloves. He looks behind himself as the door closes)
S04E20,ELAINE,"Uh Roy, this is uh Kramer -- he's one of our friends."
S04E20,ROY,"Oh, How do you do?"
S04E20,KRAMER,"Yeah... I do great, yeah."
S04E20,DOCTOR,Hi Roy.
S04E20,ROY,"Oh, hey Dr. Siegel."
S04E20,JERRY,"Hey Doc, check this out. [does an around-the-world with the Yo-Yo]"
S04E20,KRAMER,Heey.
S04E20,JERRY,I *just* learned that. (proudly holding the Yo-Yo)
S04E20,DOCTOR,A-hu. (The doctor is at a loss)
S04E20,DOCTOR,I just wanted to stop by -- see if you had any questions about tomorrow's operation.
S04E20,KRAMER,"Ah, Yeah Yeah, I have a - I have a question, um -- What do you know about inter-abdominal retractors?"
S04E20,DOCTOR,"Are you asking because you saw ""20/20"" last night?"
S04E20,KRAMER,I sure am.
S04E20,DOCTOR,Well that report was about *one* very specific type of retractor and I can assure you we do not use that retractor in your friend's procedure.
S04E20,KRAMER,But you *will* use... a retractor.
S04E20,DOCTOR,We have to...
S04E20,KRAMER,"Mmm-hmm... (turns and walks away, makes a face, raises his eyebrows, nodding his head, then turns back to the group.)"
S04E20,DOCTOR,Tell you what. You're obviously concerned about your friend's welfare. A few of my students will be observing tomorrow's operation from the viewing gallery. How would you like to watch it with them?
S04E20,KRAMER,"I'd love to watch the operation, yeah!"
S04E20,JERRY,I dunno...
S04E20,KRAMER,"Oh, come on Jerry. You gotta see the operation. They're gonna cut him open -- His guts'll be all over the place..."
S04E20,JERRY,"Yeah, that's true..."
S04E20,KRAMER,...They'll saw through bone. Uuuuuuuing yutyutyutyutn naannnaaa [makes saw noises while gesturing over Roy's chest] You'll see what's *inside* bone...
S04E20,GEORGE,Ttu (wipes nose and sniffs) Ttu.
S04E20,JERRY,Hey.
S04E20,GEORGE,Hi...
S04E20,JERRY,"What are doing, you crying??"
S04E20,GEORGE,No... (takes off his glasses and wipes his eyes with his sleeve)
S04E20,JERRY,"You crying from ""Home Alone""??"
S04E20,GEORGE,The old man got to me.
S04E20,JERRY,"Alright, just get yourself together... I dunno if I can be friends with you anymore after this display."
S04E20,GEORGE,"Oh Shut up! What are you doing back so soon, anyway? (puts the tape back in it's case.)"
S04E20,JERRY,"Oh, I never even got to the gym. Kramer got the gloves, wanted to come home and start working on his floor."
S04E20,GEORGE,Oh. How's the guy?
S04E20,JERRY,"Oh, he's okay. In fact him and Elaine are getting ah, pretty chummy. Now Elaine wants me to buy some of his art. (opens the fridge and gets a bottle of water.)"
S04E20,GEORGE,Hnh. That's nerve...
S04E20,JERRY,"Yeah, so she and ""Triangle Boy"" can go out to fancy restaurants. (takes a sip of water)"
S04E20,GEORGE,"Y'know what it is? It's ""Clara Nightingale Syndrome."" He falls ill; she falls in love."
S04E20,JERRY,You mean Florence Nightingale. **
S04E20,(** Footnote,see short bio at end of script **)
S04E20,GEORGE,What'd I say? Clara?
S04E20,JERRY,"Yeah, you must have meant Clara Barton. **"
S04E20,(** Footnote,see short bio at end of script **)
S04E20,GEORGE,Clara Barton? What did she do?
S04E20,JERRY,"I'm not sure, but I think she was nice. (takes a sip of water)"
S04E20,GEORGE,Susan B. Anthony** I think I'd have a problem with.
S04E20,(** Footnote,see short bio at end of script **)
S04E20,JERRY,"Yeah, I think you would."
S04E20,GEORGE,"So, you gonna buy his art?"
S04E20,JERRY,"No. Why don't you buy it? You got 1,900 dollars."
S04E20,GEORGE,"Yeah, that's what I want-- triangles. Alright, I'm outta here. Have fun with what's-her-name."
S04E20,JERRY,I will.
S04E20,GEORGE,"Y'know, now you gotta ask her her name. It's so embarrassing."
S04E20,JERRY,"No, it isn't. I can find out."
S04E20,GEORGE,Yeah? How?
S04E20,JERRY,There are ways.
S04E20,JERRY,"Y'know I remember when I was a kid growin up, kids would make fun of my name like you wouldn't believe-- ""Jerry Jerry Dingleberry"", and-hu ""Seinsmelled""..."
S04E20,WOMAN,"""Seinsmelled""?"
S04E20,JERRY,Yeah. a-hu. What about you? Did people make fun of your name?
S04E20,WOMAN,Are you kidding? They were merciless! What do you expect when your name rhymes with a part of the female anatomy?
S04E20,WOMAN,"(con't) Of course, not everybody can be as sweet as you are."
S04E20,WOMAN,"Oh, oh Jerry..."
S04E20,JERRY,Oh... *you*...
S04E20,GEORGE,"Now let's try ""breast""... Celeste... Kest..."
S04E20,JERRY,No.
S04E20,GEORGE,Rest... Sest... Hest...
S04E20,JERRY,"""Hest""? That's not a name."
S04E20,GEORGE,"What, you should've just asked her."
S04E20,JERRY,"I know, I should've asked her."
S04E20,GEORGE,What're you gonna do now?
S04E20,JERRY,"I dunno. I can't ask her now; I've already made out with her. Once you make out with a woman, you can't ask her her name."
S04E20,GEORGE,Aretha! (points finger at Jerry)
S04E20,JERRY,No...
S04E20,GEORGE,Bovary! (points finger again at Jerry)
S04E20,JERRY,"Alright, that's enough. (sips coffee)"
S04E20,GEORGE,"Alright, well you know what'cha gotta do, you gotta go through her purse. Y'know, the-the credit cards, driver's license..."
S04E20,JERRY,How am I gonna do that?
S04E20,GEORGE,When she goes to the bathroom.
S04E20,KRAMER,"Ah, (smacks hands) there you are. My date stood me up. Listen, will you guys go to the operation with me?"
S04E20,JERRY,You asked a date to go to the operation?
S04E20,KRAMER,"Yeah... So c'mon, (smacks hands and rubs them together) what d'you say?"
S04E20,GEORGE,What kind of operation is it?
S04E20,KRAMER,Spleenectomy.
S04E20,GEORGE,Isn't that where they remove the--
S04E20,KRAMER,"No No, Don't ruin it for me, I haven't seen it yet! Ah-C'mon, what d'you say?"
S04E20,GEORGE,Mulva! (again pointing finger at Jerry -- Kramer watches the exchange back and forth)
S04E20,JERRY,Mulva? (waves off George with his hand)
S04E20,KRAMER,"C'mon, C'mon. You wanna go? (pats Jerry a couple times on the shoulder quietly) C'mon. Yeah, yeah, yeah."
S04E20,JERRY,"Alright, alright. Just let me finish my coffee... then we'll watch 'em go slice this fat bastard up. (sips coffee)"
S04E20,DOCTOR,"Now we'll open the peritoneal cavity, exposing the body's internal organs. Nurse-- retractor."
S04E20,JERRY,What are you eating?
S04E20,KRAMER,Junior Mints. Do you want one?
S04E20,JERRY,No...
S04E20,KRAMER,"Now, I can't see..... Psst.... Psst..."
S04E20,KRAMER,"... Cou, ye, ge..."
S04E20,KRAMER,Y-ea (pours a few more Junior Mints into his hand and eats them)
S04E20,JERRY,Where'd you get those?
S04E20,KRAMER,The machine. You want one?
S04E20,JERRY,No.
S04E20,KRAMER,"Here, take one."
S04E20,JERRY,I don't want one.
S04E20,KRAMER,"No, they're good! Take one.."
S04E20,JERRY,I don't want any!
S04E20,KRAMER,Just take one.
S04E20,JERRY,"No! Stop it! Kramer, stop it!"
S04E20,"[As they struggle to force the Junior Mint on each other, Jerry pushes Kramers' hand away and -- in slow motion with the sound of a beating heart to emphasize the event -- The Junior Mint is launched into the air towards the operating table and, well, in a word","""Bingo"" -- with a small ""splat"" sound -- falls into Roy, the patient. The surgical team looks around puzzled as to what just happened -- but they continue on with the operation)"
S04E20,JERRY,(pointing at the operation he mouths the words) Did it go in?
S04E20,KRAMER,Ge--
S04E20,JERRY,"...Over the balcony, bounced off some respirator thing *into* the patient!"
S04E20,GEORGE,"What do you mean ""into the patient""?"
S04E20,JERRY,"Into the patient, *literally*!"
S04E20,GEORGE,Into the hole?
S04E20,JERRY,"Yes, the hole!"
S04E20,GEORGE,Didn't they notice it?
S04E20,JERRY,No!
S04E20,GEORGE,How could they not notice it?!?
S04E20,JERRY,Because it's a little mint. It's a *Junior* Mint.
S04E20,GEORGE,W-ca-What did they do?
S04E20,JERRY,They sealed him up with the mint inside.
S04E20,GEORGE,They *left* the Junior Mint *in* him?
S04E20,JERRY,Yes!
S04E20,GEORGE,I-I guess it can't hurt him... People eat *pounds* of those things.
S04E20,JERRY,Yes they *eat* them. They don't put them next to vital organs in their abdominal cavity!
S04E20,JERRY,Yeah.
S04E20,ELAINE,It's me.
S04E20,JERRY,Come on up.
S04E20,KRAMER,Hey. This wallpaper is *very* good. My place looks like a ski lodge!
S04E20,JERRY,Why did you force that mint on me? I told ya I didn't want the mint!
S04E20,KRAMER,"Well, I didn't believe you."
S04E20,JERRY,How could you not believe me?!?
S04E20,KRAMER,"Well who's gonna turn down a Junior Mint? It's chocolate, it's peppermint-- it's *delicious*!"
S04E20,JERRY,That's true.
S04E20,KRAMER,It's very refreshing!
S04E20,JERRY,"Well, just don't say anything about this to Elaine..."
S04E20,ELAINE,Prognosis... negative.
S04E20,JERRY,Prognosis *negative*!?
S04E20,ELAINE,"He's not doing well, the doctors don't know what it is. They're baffled."
S04E20,JERRY and KRAMER,"Oh, my God..."
S04E20,ELAINE,"Just my luck, y'know... just when he's getting thin and attractive. Y'know Jerry, you should buy some of his art. That would really lift his spirits."
S04E20,GEORGE,It's that bleak? (pours a glass of milk)
S04E20,ELAINE,Mmm... (Elaine goes to the bathroom)
S04E20,GEORGE,"Y'know if the guy dies, the art could really be worth something..."
S04E20,JERRY,We gotta confess.
S04E20,KRAMER,Really?
S04E20,JERRY,Yes!
S04E20,KRAMER,We could be tried for murder...
S04E20,JERRY,I can't have this on my conscience. We're like Leopold and Loeb! **
S04E20,(** Footnote,see short bio at end of script **)
S04E20,KRAMER,"You're not gonna say anything, you got that?"
S04E20,JERRY,I'm telling and you can't stop me!
S04E20,KRAMER,You're *not*!!!
S04E20,GEORGE,"Hey Elaine? Put me down for some of that art. 1,900 dollars worth."
S04E20,JERRY,"Oh yeah, that's the spot..."
S04E20,WOMAN,What're you so tense about?
S04E20,JERRY,"Oh, nothing really, just a homicide. [She finds the right spot on his back] Oh that's terrific... Mulva."
S04E20,WOMAN,What?
S04E20,JERRY,Mulva?
S04E20,WOMAN,Mulva?
S04E20,JERRY,"Oh my eh, my Aunt's name is Mulva. She's-she's a masseuse."
S04E20,WOMAN,huh.
S04E20,JERRY,Yeah.
S04E20,WOMAN,"Um, I'm going to the bathroom. I'll be right back."
S04E20,JERRY,"Oh, good idea..."
S04E20,WOMAN,What are you doing?
S04E20,JERRY,"Oh, I was just looking for er, some... gum or... mint."
S04E20,WOMAN,"Oh, I have Junior Mints."
S04E20,JERRY,"No! [throws her purse back at her] No, I mean, no thank you, nah..."
S04E20,KRAMER,Any news?
S04E20,JERRY,"[whispering] No, no news. You better get out of here."
S04E20,KRAMER,Oh.
S04E20,JERRY,"Oh No, wait a second... Wait a second... I-I don't know the name of this woman in the bathroom, so when she comes out, you introduce yourself and then she'll be forced to say her name."
S04E20,KRAMER,10-4.
S04E20,JERRY,O.K. (closes the apartment door)
S04E20,WOMAN,"Oh, hello."
S04E20,KRAMER,"Hello, I'm Kramer."
S04E20,WOMAN,Nice to meet you.
S04E20,KRAMER,See you later. (He promptly turns and leaves)
S04E20,WOMAN,"Well, I better get going. I don't want to be late for the play. (Grabs her coat.)"
S04E20,JERRY,"Oh, okay."
S04E20,WOMAN,Y'know my cousin knows the producer. I may get to go backstage and meet Olympia Dukakis.
S04E20,JERRY,"Oh, Hey, there's a name you don't forget."
S04E20,WOMAN,Mm. Bye Jerry.
S04E20,JERRY,Bye.
S04E20,WOMAN,"Oh, hi."
S04E20,GEORGE,"Oh, Hi, I'm George. (they shake hands)"
S04E20,WOMAN,"Oh, Nice to meet you, George."
S04E20,GEORGE,"Yeahaha, I gave it a shot (pats Jerry on the arm)... So, any word on the ""artiste""? (puts a video in the VCR)"
S04E20,JERRY,"No, I haven't heard anything."
S04E20,GEORGE,"Hehe. Well, I got my triangles. (sitting on the couch)"
S04E20,JERRY,Really...
S04E20,GEORGE,"Yup, y'know, they really spruce up the apartment."
S04E20,JERRY,"Yeah, I'm sure..."
S04E20,JERRY,"Well, I-I gotta call the Hospital. I gotta tell 'em what happened."
S04E20,GEORGE,No-no Jerry. I wouldn't do that.
S04E20,JERRY,Why?
S04E20,GEORGE,"Ehh, You could get in trouble."
S04E20,JERRY,"Look, I gotta try and help the guy."
S04E20,GEORGE,"Who are you to play God!? Every man's time comes! If his number is up, who are you to interfere!?"
S04E20,JERRY,Yes I'd like to speak with Dr. Siegel... it's about Roy Kordic's condition...
S04E20,GEORGE,W-What? What?
S04E20,JERRY,"Oh, that's *fantastic*!"
S04E20,GEORGE,"He didn't get better, did he?"
S04E20,JERRY,Thank you very much. O.K. Bye-bye. He's gonna be okay!
S04E20,GEORGE,"Where's the luck? There's no luck. 1,900 dollars down the drain."
S04E20,ROY,"You saved my life, George. You buying my art is what inspired me to get better. I'll never forget what'cha did for me."
S04E20,GEORGE,"Oh, well th-that's great. It's really great. Hm hm mm."
S04E20,KRAMER,"Y'know, art's a great investment."
S04E20,ELAINE,"And they're gonna look great in your apartment, George."
S04E20,GEORGE,"Yes I look forward to many years of... looking at the triangles. Well, I'll ah, I'll wait for you outside."
S04E20,ROY,"Hey, George..."
S04E20,GEORGE,Yeah.
S04E20,KRAMER,"Awe, alright"
S04E20,JERRY,That's nice.
S04E20,GEORGE,Thanks Roy.
S04E20,ROY,Heeyy - there's the guy who saved my life. (points at the doctor.)
S04E20,DOCTOR,"Y'know... I don't want to totally discount the emotional element in your recovery but, I think there were other factors at play here."
S04E20,JERRY,What do you mean?
S04E20,DOCTOR,"I have no medical evidence to back me up but, something happened during the operation that staved off that infection. Something beyond science. Something perhaps, from above..."
S04E20,KRAMER,Mint?
S04E20,DOCTOR,Those can be very refreshing.
S04E20,ROY,So Elaine... Where are we going for our big dinner on Friday? (takes a big mouthful of spaghetti)
S04E20,ELAINE,"Uh-m, uh I'm so sorry Roy, but actually, we are going to the, Poconos on Friday, right honey? (pointing to Jerrythe boyfriend?)"
S04E20,JERRY,I don't think so...
S04E20,ELAINE,"We are... that means that we ah, we are..."
S04E20,JERRY,I believe we're not...
S04E20,ELAINE,"(Catching another glimpse of Roy eating) Hunh, Please can we go to the Poconos?"
S04E20,JERRY,"Well, I'll think about it..."
S04E20,WOMAN,Great seats. You could see the actors spitting.
S04E20,JERRY,Really...
S04E20,WOMAN,Uh-huh. And afterwards we went backstage and Olympia Dukakis autographed my playbill.
S04E20,JERRY,"Oh, Wait a second, you got her autograph?"
S04E20,WOMAN,Yeah.
S04E20,JERRY,Do you have it with you?
S04E20,WOMAN,"Yeah, it's in my purse."
S04E20,JERRY,"Ah, Le'me see. (hands Jerry the playbill)"
S04E20,WOMAN,"Y'know I really think I'm falling for you, Jerry Seinfeld. (stands up, a quick kiss on the cheek and hugs him.)"
S04E20,WOMAN,"Oh, well, I really think I'm falling for you... [opens the playbill and flips five pages till he finds and reads autograph] .....Joseph Puglia..."
S04E20,WOMAN,I had it autographed for my uncle.
S04E20,JERRY,"Yeah, I-I know..."
S04E20,WOMAN,"(licks he lips) You don't know my name, do you?"
S04E20,JERRY,Yes I do.
S04E20,WOMAN,What is it?
S04E20,JERRY,It-it rhymes with a female body part.
S04E20,WOMAN,What is it?
S04E20,JERRY,Mulva...
S04E20,JERRY,"Aub, ah, Gipple?"
S04E20,JERRY,Loleola?
S04E20,JERRY,Oh! Oh! *Delores*!
S04E20,JERRY,"Ages zero through ten, candy is your life. There's nothing else. Family, friends, school-- they're only obstacles in the way of getting more candy. And you have your favorite candies that you love. You know the ones I love those... I hate those...''. ``I hate those... I love those...''. And only a seven year old kid could actually taste the difference between like a red M&M and a light brown, M&M. That's two totally different things when you're seven years old. ""Well, your red is more of a main course M&M, but the brown it's more of a mellower flavor; it's an after dinner M&M, really''."
S04E21,JERRY,"...And it *is* embarrassing, because a doggie bag means either you are out at a restaurant when you aren't hungry, or you've chosen the stupidest possible way to get dog food that there is. How about the doggie bag on a date? That's a good move for a guy, huh? Lemme tell you something if you're a guy and you ask for the doggie bag on a date, you might as well have them just wrap up your genitals too. You're not going to be needing those for awhile, either."
S04E21,JERRY,Is that bothering you?
S04E21,ELAINE,"No, not at all..."
S04E21,ELAINE,"Oh, could you please hurry?"
S04E21,JERRY,"[mockingly] ""Please hurry"". Look at you. Look at what you've become."
S04E21,ELAINE,"What? What have I become? I haven't ""become"" anything..."
S04E21,JERRY,"Oh, *Carl* can't wait a few more minutes?"
S04E21,ELAINE,I don't want to keep him waiting...
S04E21,JERRY,He'll like you more...
S04E21,ELAINE,That's impossible...
S04E21,WIFE,"Andrew, why do you have to pick your teeth at the table?"
S04E21,HUSBAND,Leave me alone.
S04E21,JERRY,"Yeah, I'm wanting to get married *real* soon..."
S04E21,JERRY,"So, where am I dropping you?"
S04E21,ELAINE,His place...
S04E21,JERRY,This guy's got quite a racket. I take you to dinner and then drop you off at his apartment...
S04E21,ELAINE,*And* he gets the rest of my chicken...
S04E21,JERRY,"So, is tonight ""the night""?"
S04E21,ELAINE,You never know...
S04E21,JERRY,Oooh! Bay-bee *doll*!
S04E21,JERRY,"Boy, do you smell something?"
S04E21,ELAINE,"Do I smell something? What am I, hard of smelling? Of *course* I smell something."
S04E21,JERRY,What is it?
S04E21,ELAINE,I think it's B.O.!
S04E21,JERRY,What?
S04E21,ELAINE,It's B.O. The *valet* must have had B.O.
S04E21,JERRY,It *can't* be. Nobody has B.O. like this.
S04E21,ELAINE,Jerry. It's *B*.*O*.
S04E21,JERRY,But the whole car smells.
S04E21,ELAINE,So?
S04E21,JERRY,"So when somebody has B.O., the ""O"" usually stays with the ""B"". Once the ""B"" leaves, the ""O"" goes with it."
S04E21,ELAINE,I can't believe you ski!
S04E21,CARL,I'm a great skier.
S04E21,ELAINE,Yeah? What else?
S04E21,CARL,"Let's see... I ski, I fish, I pillage, I plunder..."
S04E21,ELAINE,"[delightedly] Oh! You ""pillage and plunder""?"
S04E21,CARL,...When I travel.
S04E21,ELAINE,"See? Finally, *finally* I get to meet a man who pillages and plunders! I'm so lucky."
S04E21,GEORGE,This'll only take a second.
S04E21,KRAMER,"Yeah, I'm going to poke around..."
S04E21,GEORGE,"[to himself] Hey, whatd'ya know? Look at that! A *lesbian* sighting. Oh-ho! My lucky day. They're *so* fascinating. Why is that? Because they don't want us. You gotta respect that..."
S04E21,GEORGE,"[to himself] Oh, my God! It's Susan! What do I do?"
S04E21,SUSAN,George?
S04E21,GEORGE,"[to himself] Argh! [to Susan] Susan! Hi! Oh, boy! What are you doing here?!"
S04E21,SUSAN,Renting a video! What do you got there?
S04E21,GEORGE,"Oh, ... some stupid movie..."
S04E21,SUSAN,This is Mona.
S04E21,GEORGE,"Oh, hi..."
S04E21,MONA,Pleasure to meet you.
S04E21,GEORGE,Yes. Well...
S04E21,MONA,"Well, I'll let you two, uh... catch up."
S04E21,SUSAN,You okay?
S04E21,GEORGE,Yeah. Yes! I just haven't seen you in a long time.
S04E21,SUSAN,And you didn't expect me to be holding hands with a woman.
S04E21,GEORGE,"Oh, *please*! Me? C'mon! That's *great*! Are you kidding? I think thats fan*tastic*! I've always encouraged experimentation! I'm the first guy in the pool! Who do you think you're talking to?"
S04E21,SUSAN,I *know* who I'm talking to.
S04E21,GEORGE,"Of course you do... It's just, uh, y'know, I-I never *knew*, uh, that, uh..."
S04E21,SUSAN,I liked women?
S04E21,GEORGE,There you go.
S04E21,GEORGE,"So, uh, how long has this been going on?"
S04E21,SUSAN,Since you and I broke up.
S04E21,GEORGE,"Ssssso, after me, you... went that way?"
S04E21,SUSAN,Yeah.
S04E21,GEORGE,"Oh, I think that's fantastic. Good for you. Nice. That's very nice."
S04E21,SUSAN,"So, what have you got there?"
S04E21,GEORGE,"Oh, I, uh--"
S04E21,SUSAN,"Oh, ``Rochelle, Rochelle''"
S04E21,GEORGE,"It's a foreign movie... a *film*, is what it is, actually."
S04E21,SUSAN,"Yeah... A lot of nudity in that, huh?"
S04E21,GEORGE,"No, no, no... Just a *tiny* bit... It's not even *frontal* nudity. It's... *sidal* nudity..."
S04E21,CLERK,Next.
S04E21,GEORGE,"Oh, that's me."
S04E21,SUSAN,"Alright, well... Good seeing you, George."
S04E21,GEORGE,"Yes, good to see you, too. And Good luck with, uh... with the whole thing, there."
S04E21,CLERK,"Uh, what are you returning?"
S04E21,GEORGE,"[embarrassed pause] ``Rochelle, Rochelle''."
S04E21,CLERK,"Ah, ``Rochelle, Rochelle''... ""A young girl's strange, erotic journey from Milan to Minsk""..."
S04E21,CLERK,"Uh, that'll be, uh... $3.49."
S04E21,GEORGE,$3.49? It says $1.49.
S04E21,CLERK,"Well, you didn't rewind it. There's a $2.00 charge for not rewinding."
S04E21,GEORGE,What! There's no signs here! This is an outrage!
S04E21,KRAMER,"George, don't give him any money for that. It'll cost you less to keep it another day, rewind it and bring it back tomorrow. Don't give him the satisfaction."
S04E21,GEORGE,I'm not giving you the satisfaction. I'm gonna watch it again...
S04E21,JERRY,"So, this morning I go down to the garage to check the car out. I figure by this time, the odour molecules have had at least twelve hours to de-smellify. I open the car door, like a *punch* in the *face*, the stench hits me-- it's almost as if it had *gained* strength throughout the night..."
S04E21,ELAINE,Y'know I can think of at *least* six known offensive odours that I would *rather* smell than what's livin' in your car.
S04E21,JERRY,What about skunk?
S04E21,ELAINE,I don't mind skunk.
S04E21,JERRY,Horse manure?
S04E21,ELAINE,I *loooove* horse manure.
S04E21,JERRY,"Well, I've never seen anything like this in my life. In fact, I went to the car wash, they want 250 dollars to detail it, and get the smell out. I'm not payin' for that. That's not my responsibility. In fact, I'm drivin' up to that restaurant now, and *demand* they pay for it."
S04E21,ELAINE,Absolutely.
S04E21,ELAINE,"Listen, lemme ask you something. When you're with a guy, and he tells you he has to get up early, what does that mean?"
S04E21,JERRY,It means he's lying.
S04E21,ELAINE,Wow...
S04E21,JERRY,Why? Is that what he told you?
S04E21,ELAINE,"Yeah, last night. Oh, come on... Men *have* to get up early some time..."
S04E21,JERRY,No. Never.
S04E21,ELAINE,Jerry! I'm *sure* I've seen men on the street early in the morning.
S04E21,JERRY,"Well, sometimes we do actually have to get up early, but a man will *always* trade sleep for sex."
S04E21,ELAINE,Is it possible I'm not as attractive as I think I am?
S04E21,JERRY,Anything's *possible*...
S04E21,JERRY,What's the matter with you?
S04E21,KRAMER,Steinbrenner! He's ruinin' my life...
S04E21,JERRY,"Oh yeah, Steinbrenner..."
S04E21,KRAMER,"I don't think I can take another season with him, Jerry. He'll just trade away their best young prospects, just like he did with Beuner, McGee, Drabek... McGriff..."
S04E21,JERRY,I know the list...
S04E21,KRAMER,What's that smell?
S04E21,JERRY,What smell?
S04E21,KRAMER,Ooooh... You stink.
S04E21,JERRY,Whatd'ya mean I stink?
S04E21,KRAMER,You *stink*. Why don't you go take a shower?
S04E21,JERRY,"I showered! Oh, wait a second... Since I showered, I've been in the car!"
S04E21,ELAINE,So?
S04E21,JERRY,Don't you see what's happening here? It's attached itself to me! It's alive!
S04E21,ELAINE,"If it attached itself to you, then... Oh, my God! That's why Carl said he had to get up early! Because I stink! Jerry, he thinks I have B.O.! Me!"
S04E21,KRAMER,What happened?
S04E21,JERRY,What happened? My car *stinks* is what happened. And it's destroying the lives of everyone in it's path.
S04E21,GEORGE,What is that? B.O.?
S04E21,JERRY,Yeah.
S04E21,GEORGE,This is *unbelievable* B.O.
S04E21,JERRY,"I know... I was at the car wash this morning and the guy told me in his 38 years in the business, he's never smelled anything like it."
S04E21,GEORGE,"So, let me ask you. Do you think I could have done this?"
S04E21,JERRY,"No, no. It's the valet guy."
S04E21,GEORGE,"No, no, I mean, driving Susan to lesbianism."
S04E21,JERRY,"Oh... No, that's ridiculous."
S04E21,GEORGE,What if her experience with me *drove* her to it?
S04E21,JERRY,"Suicide, maybe, not lesbianism."
S04E21,GEORGE,"The woman she's ""lesbianing"" with? Susan told me she's *never* been with a guy."
S04E21,GEORGE,"Oh, this isn't even B.O.! This is *beyond* B.O.! It's *B*.B.O.!"
S04E21,JERRY,"There should be a B.O. squad that patrols the city like a ""Smell Gestapo"". To sniff 'em out, strip 'em down, and wash them with a big, soapy brush..."
S04E21,GEORGE,"Y'know, the funny thing is, somehow I find her more appealing now... It's like if I knew she was a lesbian when we went out, I never would've broken up with her."
S04E21,JERRY,Lemme see if I understand this... On second thought...
S04E21,JERRY,"Here he is... that's the guy! (rolls up window) No, thank you, go back... go back... I'll park it! You go back!"
S04E21,RESTAURATEUR,"What do you mean-- ""stunk up""?"
S04E21,JERRY,"I mean the car *stinks*! George, does the car stink?"
S04E21,GEORGE,Stinks.
S04E21,JERRY,Stinks!
S04E21,RESTAURATEUR,"Well, perhaps *you're* the one who has the odour..."
S04E21,JERRY,"Hey, I've never smelled in my *life*, buddy!"
S04E21,RESTAURATEUR,"Really? Well, I smell you now."
S04E21,JERRY,That's from the car!
S04E21,RESTAURATEUR,"Well, maybe *you're* the one who stunk up the car, rather than the car stinking up you!"
S04E21,GEORGE,"Oh, it's the chicken and the egg..."
S04E21,JERRY,"Thank you very much... Well, then go out and smell the car; see which smells worse."
S04E21,RESTAURATEUR,I don't have time to smell cars.
S04E21,GEORGE,Forget about smelling the car. Smell the valet. Go to the source...
S04E21,JERRY,You've gotta smell the car
S04E21,RESTAURATEUR,I'm a busy man
S04E21,JERRY,C'mon! One whiff!
S04E21,RESTAURATEUR,"Alright, one whiff..."
S04E21,RESTAURATEUR,Alright! I give up! I admit it! It stinks! Now will you let me out!
S04E21,JERRY,"Alright, will you pay for the cleaning?"
S04E21,RESTAURATEUR,Yes! 50 dollars! I'll give you 50 dollars!
S04E21,RESTAURATEUR,"I'm not paying for *that*. They've already got my seven dollars... [sarcastically] ""...erotic journey from Milan to Minsk""..."
S04E21,CARL,The valet had such bad B.O.?
S04E21,ELAINE,"Oh, man, just *rampant*, **mutant** B.O. The ""O"" went from the valet's ""B"", to the car, to me. It clings to everything. Jerry thinks it's an entity. But I showered and I shampoo'ed, so..."
S04E21,CARL,That's a relief...
S04E21,ELAINE,What?
S04E21,CARL,It's still there...
S04E21,ELAINE,"No, no, no! It *can't* be! I shampoo'ed! I rinsed! I repeated!"
S04E21,GEORGE,"Listen, I gotta ask you I was a little concerned that perhaps I was responsible in some way for your, uh... metamorphosis."
S04E21,CLERK,That'll be $98.00.
S04E21,GEORGE,What $98.00?
S04E21,CLERK,That's what I said. $98.00.
S04E21,GEORGE,How could that piece of *crap* cost $98.00!?
S04E21,GEORGE,"So, was it me?"
S04E21,SUSAN,"Oh, don't be ridiculous! Is that what you wanted to talk to me about? [Gives him the $35] Here."
S04E21,GEORGE,"Oh, thanks. Thanks a lot. I'll pay you back."
S04E21,SUSAN,"Yeah, *sure*... I gotta go."
S04E21,GEORGE,"Listen. Let me ask you something. If you and Mona were ever to... dance, how do you decide who leads? I mean... do you take turns? Do you discuss it beforehand? How does that work?"
S04E21,SUSAN,You're an idiot.
S04E21,GEORGE,Why? That's a *legitimate* sociological question.
S04E21,SUSAN,"I'll see ya. And George, by the way... You stink... Real bad."
S04E21,GEORGE,It's not me! It's the car!
S04E21,MONA,I didn't think I'd come.
S04E21,KRAMER,I knew you would.
S04E21,MONA,"Oh, Kramer!"
S04E21,CAR WASHER,"We spray everything with Ozium-D, let it de-ionise, vacuum the spray out with a de-ionising machine. Hit it with high-pressure compressed air, and wet-dry vac it to extract the remaining liquids. We top it off with one of our seven air-fresheners, in your case, I would recommend the Jasmine, or the Potpourri."
S04E21,JERRY,Let's do it.
S04E21,HAIRDRESSER,"The first thing we're gonna do is flush the follicles with the five essential oils. Then, we put you under a vapour machine, and then a heated cap. Then, we shampoo and shampoo and condition and condition. Then, we saturate the hair in diluted vinegar-- two parts vinegar, 10 parts water. Now, if that doesn't work, we have one last resort. Tomato sauce."
S04E21,ELAINE,Tomato Sauce?
S04E21,JERRY,Wait a minute! It still smells! It still smells!
S04E21,CARL,It still smells.
S04E21,JERRY,It still smells!
S04E21,GEORGE,How could it still smell after all that?
S04E21,JERRY,I don't know!
S04E21,GEORGE,"Well, what are you gonna do?"
S04E21,JERRY,"I'll tell you what I'm gonna do, I'm selling that car!"
S04E21,GEORGE,You're *selling* the car!?
S04E21,JERRY,You don't understand what I'm up against. This is a force more powerful than anything you can imagine. Even *Superman* would be helpless against this kind of stench. And I'll take anything I can get for it.
S04E21,GEORGE,Maybe I'll buy it.
S04E21,JERRY,Are you crazy? Don't you understand what I'm saying to you? This is not just an odour-- you need a *priest* to get rid of this thing!
S04E21,ELAINE,I still smell!
S04E21,JERRY,You see! You see what I'm saying to you? It's a presence! It's the beast!
S04E21,SUSAN,"Kramer! Kramer! Kramer, open up, I know you're in there!"
S04E21,JERRY,Susan!
S04E21,SUSAN,Kramer!
S04E21,JERRY,What is going on?
S04E21,SUSAN,"You know what's going on? First, he vomits on me. Then, he burns down my father's cabin. And now, he's taken Mona away from me."
S04E21,GEORGE,He stole your girlfriend?
S04E21,SUSAN,Yes. She's in *love* with him.
S04E21,GEORGE,"Amazing. I drive them to lesbianism, he brings 'em back."
S04E21,JERRY,That's the *least* of what you've accomplished...
S04E21,ELAINE,"Wait a minute, wait a minute. Kramer, Kramer... Hold on a second. I don't get this. This woman has *never* been with a man her *entire* life--"
S04E21,KRAMER,I'm Kramer.
S04E21,GEORGE,I know what you're going through. Women. Who knows what they want?
S04E21,SUSAN,I just don't know what she sees in *Kramer*.
S04E21,GEORGE,Listen. You're beautiful. You're intelligent. You'll meet other girls...
S04E21,SUSAN,You think so?
S04E21,GEORGE,"Yes, I know so. You happen to be a very eligible lesbian."
S04E21,SUSAN,You're very sweet...
S04E21,GEORGE,"Hey, I know what I'm talking about. I gotta be honest with you, I gotta tell ya... Ever since I saw you holding hands with that woman, I can't get you out of my mind."
S04E21,SUSAN,Really?
S04E21,GEORGE,"Yeah, you're just so... hip."
S04E21,GEORGE,"Oh, my God..."
S04E21,SUSAN,What?
S04E21,GEORGE,It's Allison. I dated her right after you. She's obsessed with me.
S04E21,ALLISON,George?
S04E21,GEORGE,"Allison! Hi! Oh, my God! How are you?"
S04E21,ALLISON,"Good. You know, you owe me $50..."
S04E21,GEORGE,"Right. I don't have it on me. Allison, this is Susan. Susan, Allison."
S04E21,ALLISON,Nice to meet you...
S04E21,SUSAN,Nice to meet you...
S04E21,ALLISON,That's a beautiful vest...
S04E21,SUSAN,Thank you...
S04E21,KRAMER,"I don't understand it. I was with her last night in my apartment; it was very romantic. Y'know with that fake wood wallpaper, the atmosphere is *fabulous* in there, now. It's like a ski lodge."
S04E21,SALESMAN,What year did you say this was?
S04E21,JERRY,'90.
S04E21,KRAMER,"Anyway, we were on the couch, I move to hug her, next thing she tells me she's leaving; she's got to get up early."
S04E21,JERRY,That's strange...
S04E21,SALESMAN,How many miles you got on this thing?
S04E21,JERRY,23 000.
S04E21,KRAMER,"And I was looking good, too. I had a nice, new shirt on, I'm wearing *your* jacket..."
S04E21,JERRY,Wait a second... My jacket! I wore that in the car! The Beast!
S04E21,SALESMAN,I can't sell this car.
S04E21,JERRY,This... **thing**... has got to be stopped!
S04E21,HAIRDRESSER,"So, what do you want to do?"
S04E21,ELAINE,Sauce me.
S04E22,JERRY,"I have a friend who is about to get married, they're having the bachelor party and the bridal shower on the same day... So it's conceivable that while she's getting the lingerie, he'd be at a nude bar watching a table dancer wearing the same outfit. That is possible. But to me, the difference between being single and being married, is the form of government. You see, when you're single, you are the dictator of your own life. I have complete power. I can give the order to fall asleep on the sofa with the TV on in the middle of the day, no-one can overrule me! When you're married, you're part of a vast decision-making body. Before anything gets done there are meetings. Committees have to study the situation. And this is if the marriage works. That's what's so painful about divorce you get impeached and you're not even the president!"
S04E22,GEORGE,"Hey, is it my imagination, or do really good looking women walk a lot faster than everybody else?"
S04E22,ELAINE,We don't walk that fast...
S04E22,GEORGE,No seriously...
S04E22,ELAINE,"Seriously, we don't."
S04E22,GEORGE,"The better looking they are, the faster they go! I mean, I see they out there on the street, they're zooming around, like a blur. Like they have a motor on their ass."
S04E22,ELAINE,"(Yelling to Jerry in the bedroom) Hey Jerry, come on, let's go. We're gonna miss the previews!"
S04E22,ELAINE,"Hey, how are we gettin' to Scott Drake's party on Saturday night?"
S04E22,JERRY,"Oh, Drake's party, I forgot to buy a present."
S04E22,GEORGE,I gotta buy a present now?
S04E22,ELAINE,"Of course you do, it's an engagement party."
S04E22,GEORGE,"It never ends, this present stuff! Engagement present! Then they get married, you gonna have to get them something for that! Then the baby, there's another present. Then the baby starts getting their presents. I don't even like Drake."
S04E22,JERRY,You don't like the Drake?
S04E22,GEORGE,Hate the Drake.
S04E22,ELAINE,I *love* the Drake.
S04E22,JERRY,How could you not like the Drake?
S04E22,GEORGE,Who's the Drake?
S04E22,ELAINE,"""Who's the Drake""?"
S04E22,JERRY,The Drake is good!
S04E22,ELAINE,"So listen, what are you gonna get him?"
S04E22,GEORGE,I haven't even met the fiancee! Whatever! (Leaves for washroom)
S04E22,JERRY,"Elaine, look. I drew this triangle free-hand. It's a doodle. It's perfect!"
S04E22,ELAINE,So what? That's easy.
S04E22,JERRY,Easy?
S04E22,ELAINE,"Hi! Hey, have you gotten your present yet for the Drake?"
S04E22,KRAMER,"Uh, no, no, not yet."
S04E22,JERRY,Do you like the Drake?
S04E22,KRAMER,I *love* the Drake! I'm looking forward to meeting the Drakette!
S04E22,ELAINE,I'm lukewarm about the Drakette.
S04E22,KRAMER,(Looking at Jerry's doodle) That's a nice triangle...
S04E22,JERRY,It's Isosceles
S04E22,KRAMER,"Ooh, Isosceles. I love the name Isosceles. If I had a kid, I would name him Isosceles. Isosceles Kramer."
S04E22,ELAINE,"Hey, you know what, maybe we should all chip in for the gift."
S04E22,JERRY,The chip-in!
S04E22,ELAINE,"Hey, a pretty good idea, huh?"
S04E22,JERRY,Yeah!
S04E22,KRAMER,"Yeah, the chip-in, defenitely!"
S04E22,JERRY,"You know what, let's go to that mall in Liberal(sp?) before we go to the party. We'll have to take your car, it's got the most room."
S04E22,KRAMER,"No, no! My car's not running."
S04E22,JERRY,What about your father's car?
S04E22,GEORGE,"No, no, no. Out of the question. I was over there today. He's got the good spot in front of the good building in the good neighbourhood. I know he's not gonna wanna move."
S04E22,JERRY,Are you serious?
S04E22,GEORGE,"You don't know what that spot means to him. Once he gets it, he doesn't go out for weeks."
S04E22,JERRY,"How about this, you put your car in the good spot, that'll hold the good spot in front of the good building, and we can get the good car!"
S04E22,GEORGE,Good thinking!
S04E22,JERRY,Good to meet you!
S04E22,ELAINE,So what are we gonna get him?
S04E22,JERRY,"We could get him anything we wanted, we're chippin' in."
S04E22,GEORGE,I like this area. I could live out here.
S04E22,KRAMER,"Yeah, we ought to all get a house and live together."
S04E22,JERRY,"Yeah, that's a good idea. I'll tell you what chuckles, I give you permission to sublet my room right now."
S04E22,GEORGE,"Look at this. There's no spaces here. (to another car) Excuse me, are you gettin' out?"
S04E22,MAN IN CAR,No!
S04E22,KRAMER,Why don't you take a handicap spot...
S04E22,GEORGE,You think?
S04E22,ELAINE,"No, no! We'll find a space. There's spaces in the other lot."
S04E22,GEORGE,I don't want to walk that far.
S04E22,ELAINE,What if a handicapped person needs it?
S04E22,KRAMER,"Oh, come on, they don't drive!"
S04E22,JERRY,"Yes, they do!"
S04E22,KRAMER,Have you ever seen a handicapped person pull into a space and park?
S04E22,JERRY,"Well there's spaces there, they must drive!"
S04E22,KRAMER,"Well they don't. If they could drive, they wouldn't be handicapped."
S04E22,ELAINE,"So if you can drive, you're not handicapped?"
S04E22,GEORGE,"Look, we're not gonna be that long anyway... we have to get to the ""party""!"
S04E22,KRAMER,"I got news for you handicapped people, they don't even want to park there! They wanna be treated just like anybody else! That's why, those spaces are always empty."
S04E22,GEORGE,"He's right! It's the same thing with the femenists. You know, they want everything to be equal, everything! But when the check comes, where are they?"
S04E22,ELAINE,What does that mean?
S04E22,GEORGE,"Yeah! Alright, I'm pulling in."
S04E22,KRAMER,"Yeah, go ahead."
S04E22,ELAINE,George!
S04E22,GEORGE,"Oh, come on, it's five minutes."
S04E22,KRAMER,Make sure we don't forget where the car's parked.
S04E22,"JERRY, GEORGE, ELAINE",Don't worry. We won't forget!
S04E22,JERRY,Do you believe the deal we got on this? A big screen TV? At that price?
S04E22,ELAINE,"What a sale, huh? And how about that store, delivering it tonight? We're gonna be swimming in 'thank you's..."
S04E22,GEORGE,"What did I get the veggie burger for? You got a veggie burger, so I had to get the veggie burger, I'm allover crums..."
S04E22,JERRY,"No-one's gonna have a better gift than this big screen TV! Good for them, love the Drake!"
S04E22,ELAINE,Got to *love* the Drake!
S04E22,JERRY,"Hey, what's going on over here?"
S04E22,ELAINE,Must have been an accident...
S04E22,JERRY,"(to a woman) Hey, what's going on?"
S04E22,WOMAN,"Some jerk parked in a handicap spot, so this woman in a wheelchair had to wheel up this incline, and half way up her batteries gave up, and she rolled backwards into the wall. Taken her to St. Elizabeth's..."
S04E22,JERRY,Is she OK?
S04E22,WOMAN,I don't know. We're just waiting here for the owner of this car to show up. May not get out alive! Thug! Taking up a handicap spot? He's gonna pay!
S04E22,JERRY,"Son's of bitches! Good luck finding them... him... whatever. I'd like to stick around and get my hands on him myself, but I gotta take off."
S04E22,GEORGE,How are we gonna get out of here? They'll kill us!
S04E22,ELAINE,(to George) Are you happy now?
S04E22,KRAMER,Who would think these people we're gonna be here?
S04E22,JERRY,I don't know...
S04E22,ELAINE,What about the party? What about the Drake?
S04E22,GEORGE,Screw the Drake!
S04E22,JERRY,I love the Drake!
S04E22,KRAMER,Let's just take a bus back to the city.
S04E22,GEORGE,Can't leave the car here!
S04E22,KRAMER,Why not?
S04E22,GEORGE,It's my father's car!
S04E22,MAN,Let's smash it!
S04E22,EVERYBODY,Yeah! Yeah!
S04E22,JERRY,Let's get out of here.
S04E22,GEORGE,What are we gonna do? How are we gonna get out of here?
S04E22,JERRY,"The thing is, even if we go back by the car, and there's nobody there, how do we know they're not all hiding, waiting for us?"
S04E22,ELAINE,"Well, they have to give up some time, they can't stay out there all night?"
S04E22,JERRY,"What are we, John Dillinger? How did this get to be the crime of the century? It's not like we stuck a broomstick in her spokes and she went flying..."
S04E22,GEORGE,"What I don't get is, just because the battery is dead, you think she'd be able to roll up the hill with her hands!"
S04E22,KRAMER,You'd think...
S04E22,GEORGE,"I mean, batteries have gone dead before, aren't they prepared for that?"
S04E22,KRAMER,Most of them don't even have batteries.
S04E22,GEORGE,"Must be one of those rich, spoiled handicapped people, who didn't want to do any work, and just wanted to sit in her wheelchair and take it easy."
S04E22,KRAMER,Yeah...
S04E22,GEORGE,"Well, I'm sorry!"
S04E22,ELAINE,Our big screen TV is probably arriving right now...
S04E22,GEORGE,How are we gonna get out of here? We need a plan!
S04E22,JERRY,I got it! (snaps his fingers) We give the keys to Elaine.
S04E22,ELAINE,Me?
S04E22,JERRY,Yeah! You're a woman! Men don't hit a woman!
S04E22,ELAINE,"Oh, they won't?"
S04E22,JERRY,Not if they don't know you...
S04E22,ELAINE,"I'm not going for this, Kramer should go! It was all his idea!"
S04E22,KRAMER,No chance in hell!
S04E22,JERRY,"What if we created some sort of diversion? What if we all went by the car and started screaming ""There he is, there's the guy that took the handicap spot!"" And then, when they all run into the other direction, we'll jump in the car!"
S04E22,GEORGE,"That's good, we'll give it a try..."
S04E22,ELAINE,That's good...
S04E22,JERRY,"That doesn't work, we'll give 'em Kramer!"
S04E22,KRAMER,Huh?
S04E22,JERRY,"(as George picks up a broken piece of his car) You know, a lot of these scratches will buff right out..."
S04E22,FRANK,Eight years have I had this car. Not a scratch on it! Eight years!
S04E22,FRANK,A beautiful Mercury! I special-ordered that bench seat!
S04E22,GEORGE,"Dad, that other car cut us off! They had swastikas all over it... They were hurling racial epiphates at us... I could have been killed!"
S04E22,ESTELLE,(to Frank) I told you not to give it to him!
S04E22,FRANK,"(to George) You know, my insurance doesn't cover this? The whole thing is a total loss!"
S04E22,MAHJONG LADY,"Frank, the important thing is, he didn't get hurt!"
S04E22,FRANK,No it isn't!
S04E22,MAHJONG LADY,"So what are you doing now, Georgie?"
S04E22,GEORGE,I'm uh... writing a pilot for NBC...
S04E22,FRANK,Where the hell is my paper?
S04E22,MAHJONG LADY,You're writing a pilot?
S04E22,ESTELLE,"With his friend, Jerry Seinfeld... the comedian..."
S04E22,MAHJONG LADY,So what's it about?
S04E22,GEORGE,"Well, Jerry's car gets hit and the other driver doesn't have any insurance, so the judge"
S04E22,MAHJONG LADY,"This is the same situation! Frank, maybe you ought to make him your butler!"
S04E22,ESTELLE,"Every time you're with that Kramer, something happens... He's a real trouble maker!"
S04E22,GEORGE,"Nah, he didn't have anything to do with it..."
S04E22,ESTELLE,"He's all together crazy, that one! Jerry? I used to think was nice... I don't know what happened to him..."
S04E22,JERRY,"(to the Drake) So it was a good party, huh? Oh... you're welcome, you're welcome... (to Elaine) They loved the TV, *loved* it!"
S04E22,ELAINE,"Oh, yeah..."
S04E22,JERRY,"(to the Drake) Oh, wait a second, I'll ask her.. that's a great idea. (To Elaine) Drake wants to know if we want to come out to Minneolis this afternoon, since we missed the partly last night, to maybe get something to eat?"
S04E22,ELAINE,Sure!
S04E22,JERRY,"(to the Drake) Sure! ... Okay... Don't worry, I'm taking MY car! ... okay... okay, see you later... bye..."
S04E22,JERRY,The Drake is great!
S04E22,ELAINE,Hmm.. he's so nice! I'm really happy for them.
S04E22,JERRY,"Yeah. Well, I don't know if I'm happy for them, I mean I'm glad they're happy, but, frankly, that doesn't do anything for me."
S04E22,JERRY,Yes?
S04E22,GEORGE,It's me.
S04E22,JERRY,Come on up.
S04E22,KRAMER,Hey. I just came from St. Elizabeth's.
S04E22,JERRY,St. Elizabeth's Hospital? Why?
S04E22,KRAMER,"Well, the handicapped woman? I went to see her."
S04E22,ELAINE,You went to see her?
S04E22,KRAMER,Yeah.
S04E22,JERRY,"Wow, what happened?"
S04E22,KRAMER,I'm in love.
S04E22,JERRY,What?
S04E22,KRAMER,"Yeah, she is the most beautiful woman I have ever seen. I love her Jerry, I really love her. I'm gonna ask her to marry me. She's got everything I've always wanted in another human being. Except for the walking."
S04E22,JERRY,"Oh, what's the difference, you don't go out that much."
S04E22,KRAMER,"Ah, I'm glad you're here."
S04E22,GEORGE,What?
S04E22,KRAMER,"Alright, now, we gotta go out. We gotta buy a wheelchair."
S04E22,GEORGE,A wheelchair? What for?
S04E22,KRAMER,"Well, you know I went to the hospital today, and I saw the woman, you know, and the wheelchair is totalled, we gotta get her another one!"
S04E22,GEORGE,Doesn't she have collision?
S04E22,KRAMER,"George, I'm in love with her!"
S04E22,GEORGE,"Well, my father works for the United Volunteers, maybe he can get her one."
S04E22,KRAMER,No! She needs it now!
S04E22,GEORGE,What about these two? Aren't they gonna chip in?
S04E22,KRAMER,Well...
S04E22,ELAINE,"Hey, we told you not to park there!"
S04E22,GEORGE,Can't we just fix the old one?
S04E22,KRAMER,"Alright, alright. Fine George! Don't chip in! But some day, we're gonna be driving along, we're gonna look out the window, and see her crawling along 5th avenue! Is that what you want?"
S04E22,GEORGE,"Alright, alright! We'll buy her a wheelchair! Wheelchairs, engagement presents.. IT NEVER ENDS!"
S04E22,SALESMAN,This is out best model. The Cougar 9000. It's the Rolls Royce of wheelchairs. This is like... you're almost glad to be handicapped.
S04E22,KRAMER,"So now, what's this got?"
S04E22,SALESMAN,"Inductive joystick, dynamic braking, flip-up arms, it's fully loaded. I put Stephen Hawking in one of these two months ago, he's lovin' it! It's rated number one by Hospital Supply and Prosthetic Magazine."
S04E22,GEORGE,How much?
S04E22,SALESMAN,6200.
S04E22,GEORGE,Do you have something a little more... less expensive?
S04E22,JERRY and ELAINE,Hey Drake! Hi Drake!
S04E22,JERRY,"Hey Alison! Hey, there's the TV, Elaine, look at that!"
S04E22,ELAINE,"My God this is fantastic! Tell me, were you guys just blown away or what?"
S04E22,THE DRAKE,"Oh yeah, yeah... it's fantastic..."
S04E22,JERRY,"I am gonna make good use of this! I'm watching every superbowl here, every big fight...."
S04E22,ELAINE,"Oh man, there is nothing like a really big TV, huh?"
S04E22,JERRY,So where're we eatin'?
S04E22,THE DRAKE,"Well, actually... Jerry..."
S04E22,ELAINE,I'm *really* hungry!
S04E22,THE DRAKE,... we just broke up...
S04E22,JERRY,When did this happen?
S04E22,THE DRAKE,"About 20 minutes ago... Hey, I am really sorry about this guys... whew!"
S04E22,JERRY,(looking at the TV) Look at the picture on this thing...
S04E22,ELAINE,"Oh, cristal clear!"
S04E22,JERRY,They know how to make 'em...
S04E22,ELAINE,Are there any good Italian restaurants around here?
S04E22,THE DRAKE,(through his sobbing) Gagliano's... that's pretty good...
S04E22,JERRY,Well... we should...
S04E22,ELAINE,Get movin'...
S04E22,JERRY,"Yeah... Hey, Drake, what ever happens, I am sure it'll be for the best."
S04E22,ELAINE,Take it easy. Bye-Bye Alison!
S04E22,ELAINE,"Oh, the remote! Okay, I'm just gonna put it on top of the television..."
S04E22,SALESMAN,"Alright, this one is about 8 years old. Not a scratch on it, it was owned by some lady who only used it to go from the bathroom to the kitchen and to feed her cat."
S04E22,KRAMER,But this'll get you around?
S04E22,SALESMAN,"Oh sure, it just doesn't have any of the thrills of the Cougar."
S04E22,GEORGE,Like what?
S04E22,SALESMAN,"For example, your tremor-damping."
S04E22,KRAMER,Now what's that?
S04E22,SALESMAN,It helps to control the direction regardless of the operator's tremors or spasticity.
S04E22,KRAMER,"Well, is it alright if I try it?"
S04E22,SALESMAN,Hop in!
S04E22,KRAMER,Oh yeah!
S04E22,SALESMAN,I tell ya...
S04E22,SALESMAN,"When I see someone enjoying themselves like that, it reminds me why I got into this business in the first place."
S04E22,GEORGE,How much?
S04E22,SALESMAN,How about $240?
S04E22,GEORGE & KRAMER,We'll take it!
S04E22,ELAINE,Drake gave her the TV?
S04E22,JERRY,He gave her all the gifts; he felt guilty.
S04E22,ELAINE,"Well, she can't keep it, it's not fair, that's *our* TV!"
S04E22,JERRY,I know it is!
S04E22,ELAINE,"Boy, I am really starting to dislike the Drake!"
S04E22,JERRY,I hate the Drake! Maybe the whole thing was a scam. Anybody can just get engaged and get presents and just keep them all. Maybe they're on their way to Chicago tomorrow and do the whole thing all over again.
S04E22,ELAINE,They don't know anybody in Chicago.
S04E22,JERRY,"Don't worry, they'll make friends fast with that nice TV."
S04E22,GEORGE,Hey.
S04E22,JERRY,"Hey, guess what? The Drake broke up."
S04E22,JERRY,I don't know about defraying.
S04E22,GEORGE,Why?
S04E22,JERRY,We're not gettin' that TV.
S04E22,GEORGE,"What do you mean? The engagement is off, we get the TV back. That's business."
S04E22,ELAINE,The Drakette took it.
S04E22,GEORGE,"She can't take it. It's not hers, it's theirs. Once there's no theirs there's no hers, it should be ours."
S04E22,ELAINE,"Well, she has it!"
S04E22,GEORGE,(upset) I *told* you the Drake was bad! I hate the Drake!
S04E22,GEORGE,Maybe we should call her.
S04E22,ELAINE,"Well, who's gonna call?"
S04E22,JERRY,You are.
S04E22,ELAINE,What? Why is it me who always has to do these things?
S04E22,JERRY,Because that's your thing!
S04E22,ELAINE,"What? Calling people I hardly know, and demanding they return expensive gifts, that's my ""thing""?"
S04E22,JERRY,"Yeah, that's your thing."
S04E22,ELAINE,"Alright, gimme the phone... it's my ""thing""..."
S04E22,JERRY,"(to George) You know, I'm thinking about getting a yo-yo."
S04E22,GEORGE,Really?
S04E22,JERRY,Yeah.
S04E22,GEORGE,I could see that...
S04E22,(Alison through phone),Hello?
S04E22,ELAINE,"Alison! Hi, this is Elaine..."
S04E22,(Alison through phone),I gave all the gifts to charity.
S04E22,ELAINE,"Oh, Okay... well thanks a lot... sorry again about you and the Drake..."
S04E22,(Alison though phone),I hate the Drake.
S04E22,ELAINE,Everybody does. Bye-bye....
S04E22,ELAINE,She gave it to charity.
S04E22,JERRY,Charity?!? That's apalling.
S04E22,GEORGE,How could anybody be so selfish and inconsiderate!
S04E22,KRAMER,"Well, I gave her the wheelchair! You should have seen the look on her face. And then she told me, that the old wheelchair, that wasn't any good anyway! So you see George, the whole incident was a God blessing! Yeah!"
S04E22,GEORGE,You mean a blessing in disguise?
S04E22,KRAMER,Yeah....
S04E22,LADY,"And I would also like to personally thank our gracious host Frank Costanza, who has earned the silver circle award and is our unanimous choice for the United Volunteer Representative of the Month!"
S04E22,LADY,"Due to his tireless effort, he personally raised over $22,000. That's a lot of wheelchairs!"
S04E22,LADY,"On behalf of the United Volunteers of Greater New York, we thank you!"
S04E22,FRANK,Well... thank you very much!
S04E22,COP,Mr. Costanza?
S04E22,FRANK,Yes?
S04E22,COP,You're under arrest.
S04E22,FRANK,Under arrest? What for?
S04E22,COP,"Reckless endangerment of public safety, and violation of traffic code 342-A."
S04E22,FRANK,What's that?
S04E22,COP,Parking in a handicap spot. Let's go...
S04E22,FRANK,George! George!
S04E22,JERRY,Your father got arrested? For what?
S04E22,GEORGE,"Parking in a handicap spot. Right in the middle of his United Volunteers meeting. When he got back, he chased after me with a baseball bat."
S04E22,JERRY,Ho-ly!
S04E22,GEORGE,"Between the car getting totalled, the towing charge and the fine, there's no way I can ever pay him back..."
S04E22,JERRY,So what are you gonna do?
S04E22,GEORGE,I agreed to become his butler.
S04E22,JERRY,What?
S04E22,JERRY,What's the matter?
S04E22,KRAMER,It's over!
S04E22,JERRY,What's over?
S04E22,KRAMER,Me and Lola....
S04E22,GEORGE,The woman we bought the wheelchair for?
S04E22,KRAMER,"Yeah, she dumped me!"
S04E22,JERRY,She dumped you?
S04E22,KRAMER,She dumped me! She rolled right over me! Said I was a hipster dufus. Am I a hipster dufus?
S04E22,JERRY & GEORGE,(hesitatingly) ... no...
S04E22,KRAMER,"Said I'm not good looking enough for her. Not good looking! Jerry, look at me, look at my face, huh, am I beautiful? George, am I beautiful?"
S04E22,GEORGE,...you're very attractive...
S04E22,KRAMER,yeah... she says she doesn't wanna see me again. Told me to drop dead!
S04E22,JERRY,Drop dead?
S04E22,GEORGE,"Boy, even I never heard that one..."
S04E22,JERRY,She's pretty rough!
S04E22,KRAMER,Yeesh-jip!
S04E22,GEORGE,"Well, we just blew 240 bucks on a wheelchair."
S04E22,JERRY,240 bucks?
S04E22,GEORGE,"Well, it was slightly used..."
S04E22,JERRY,Used?
S04E22,Frank (picking up his shoes),I don't think you did such a good job on these...
S04E22,GEORGE,What!?
S04E22,FRANK,You're supposed to your face there! Do you see your face in there?
S04E22,FRANK,Yeah? ...oh really?...oh... how about that?... Right down a hill huh? Okay! Alight! Bye!
S04E22,FRANK,"George, forget about the shoes. Want you to do something for me (scribbles something on a piece of paper). This handicapped woman had an accident. Somebody gave her a used wheelchair with defective brakes."
S04E22,GEORGE,Sons of bitches!
S04E22,FRANK,"Anyway, I want you to pick up this big screen TV, and deliver it to her."
S04E22,GEORGE,Big screen TV?
S04E22,FRANK,Do you think you can handle it?
S04E22,ALLISON,Yes?
S04E22,GEORGE,"Hi, we're from the United Volunteers, we've come to pick up the TV."
S04E22,ALLISON,"Oh great, it's right over there."
S04E22,KRAMER,"Ooh, it's a big one!"
S04E22,GEORGE,Who's got the receipt?
S04E22,ELAINE,I do.
S04E22,GEORGE,Will they give us cash?
S04E22,JERRY,That's their policy.
S04E22,GEORGE,"I hate this mall, there are never any spaces here..."
S04E22,KRAMER,Why don't you park in front of the hydrant?
S04E22,GEORGE,What if there is a fire?
S04E22,KRAMER,What are the chances of that?
S04E23,[setting,night club]
S04E23,JERRY,"To me, the whole concept of fear of success is proof that we are definitely scraping the bottom of the fear barrel. Are we gonna have to have AA-type meetings for these people? They'll go ""Hi, my name is Bill, and the one thing I'm worried about is to have a stereo and a cream-colored couch."" According to most studies, people's number-one fear is public speaking. Number two is death. *Death* is number two! Now, this means to the average person, if you have to go to a funeral, you're better off in the casket than doing the eulogy."
S04E23,[setting,Jerry's]
S04E23,KRAMER,Why can't I play Kramer?
S04E23,JERRY,Look we've been through this already. You're not an actor!
S04E23,KRAMER,Neither are you.
S04E23,JERRY,I know. So why do we need two people in the show that can't act?
S04E23,KRAMER,"Oh come on Jerry. How hard is it to act. You say something, I'll pretend it's funny."
S04E23,JERRY,My grandmother's in the hospital.
S04E23,KRAMER,Ha ha ha. Your grandmother's in the hospital!
S04E23,JERRY,This is real believable.
S04E23,KRAMER,What you didn't think I was really laughing?
S04E23,JERRY,It stinks.
S04E23,KRAMER,Let me see you do it.
S04E23,JERRY,Say something funny.
S04E23,KRAMER,Alright. I've never been to Mars but I imagine it's quite lovely.
S04E23,JERRY,Ah..........
S04E23,KRAMER,"Mine was better than that! Come on look. (starts to laugh again, Jerry too)"
S04E23,GEORGE,Why are two pretending to be laughing?
S04E23,JERRY,We're acting. (they stop laughing)
S04E23,GEORGE,"Oh, real good. (George makes a face like you stink) Any word from NBC?"
S04E23,JERRY,No.
S04E23,GEORGE,I don't understand. They're supposed to be casting this week. Something's wrong. Maybe they're not doing it.
S04E23,KRAMER,(to Jerry) Well at least let me audition.
S04E23,JERRY,(to George) He wants to play Kramer in the Pilot.
S04E23,KRAMER,(to George) Yeah!
S04E23,GEORGE,Out of the question.
S04E23,KRAMER,Oughh!
S04E23,GEORGE,(to Jerry) How could we not hear anything? What's with this Russel? What's he doing? (Jerry raises his arms and shoulders like he doesn't know)
S04E23,[setting,"Peter McManus cafe, an Italian restaurant]"
S04E23,RUSSELL,I really appreciate you coming.
S04E23,ELAINE,"Oh, that's O.K. I don't have much time though. So..."
S04E23,RUSSELL,"All right, first of all, I want to apologize for all the phone calls. It's just--It's just-- (awkward pause) I don't understand, we went out once..."
S04E23,ELAINE,That was two months ago.
S04E23,RUSSELL,Yes I know. I just-- I can't get you out of my mind. Ever since that-- that day in the restaurant when we met... (we see a flashback from 'The Shoes' of Elaine showing her cleavage and asking Russell for his Ketchup secret)
S04E23,ELAINE,"Russell, you are the president of NBC. You can have any woman you want. (picks up the bowl of munchies on the table)"
S04E23,RUSSELL,But I want you.
S04E23,ELAINE,"God I hate these mixtures. Why don't they just put pretzels on the table. Even peanuts would be good, but I don't know how eats these cheesy things (she does)."
S04E23,RUSSELL,Is it something I said... or did?
S04E23,ELAINE,"Um... Look Russell... You're a very sweet guy. But I got to be honest with you. I don't like television... and that's your world. That's your life. I mean maybe if you were in... I don't know... Greenpeace or something, that would be different, but network television... I mean, come on, Russell, you're part of the problem."
S04E23,RUSSELL,"Oh Elaine, we're doing some really very interesting things right now. We've got some very exciting pilots for next season. We have one with a bright young comedian, Jerry Seinfeld."
S04E23,ELAINE,"Oh yeah, oh yeah. I've heard of him. He's that ""Did you ever notice this? Did you ever notice that?"" guy."
S04E23,RUSSELL,Yeah. Anyway it's a ground breaking show.
S04E23,ELAINE,Really? What is it about?
S04E23,RUSSELL,"(a little more enthusiast) Well, really, it's very unusual. It's about nothing."
S04E23,ELAINE,(surprised) What do you mean it's about nothing?
S04E23,RUSSELL,"(starts doing George at the first meeting with NBC in 'The Pitch') For example, what did you do today?"
S04E23,ELAINE,"Um, I got up. Um, I went to work. Then I came here."
S04E23,RUSSELL,There's a show. that's a show.
S04E23,ELAINE,"Russell, see, I'm really not interested in this stuff and I do have to go to work (she gets up). So..."
S04E23,RUSSELL,"(stops doing George, he's down again) Elaine, When--when--when are we gonna see each other again."
S04E23,ELAINE,"I'm sorry Russell. I'm sorry O.K.? Bye-bye. (Russell, still sitting watches her leaving)."
S04E23,[setting,Jerry's]
S04E23,JERRY,Hello? Yeah he's here. (to Kramer) Hey! It's for you.
S04E23,GEORGE,He's getting phone calls here now? (he's standing near the counter and eating chips out of a big bag)
S04E23,JERRY,(to George) Again with the sweat pants?
S04E23,GEORGE,What? I'm comfortable.
S04E23,JERRY,"You know the message you're sending out to the world with these sweat pants? You're telling the world ""I give up. I can't compete in normal society. I'm miserable, so I might as well be comfortable."" (George is baffled)"
S04E23,KRAMER,"(to the phone) Hold on a second I got another call. Hello? Yeah, he'll call you back. (Jerry and George look at each other)"
S04E23,JERRY,(to Kramer) Who is it?
S04E23,KRAMER,That's NBC.
S04E23,JERRY,NBC!?! Give me the phone!
S04E23,KRAMER,I'm in the middle of a conversation here.
S04E23,JERRY,Get off the phone!
S04E23,KRAMER,"(to the phone) Look, I'll call you back. (hangs up)"
S04E23,JERRY,You know I'm waiting to hear from them. Who was it?
S04E23,KRAMER,Russell Dalrimple's secretary.
S04E23,JERRY,"All right. Now you're doing something to help me. (to the phone) Hello yeah it's Jerry Seinfeld returning the call. Uh-huh.. O.K. great thanks a lot. (hangs up)(to George) Casting tomorrow at NBC. 400. We're in business baby, the pilot's on. You're gonna successful. (George looks disappointed)"
S04E23,[setting,Dana's office]
S04E23,GEORGE,What if the pilot gets picked up and it becomes a series?
S04E23,DANA,"That'd be wonderful George, you'll be rich and successful."
S04E23,GEORGE,"Yeah, that's exactly what I'm worried about. God would never let me be successful. He'd kill me first. He'd never let me be happy."
S04E23,DANA,I thought you didn't believe in God?
S04E23,GEORGE,I do for the bad things.
S04E23,DANA,Do you hear what you're saying? God isn't out to get you George. What... What is that on your lip?
S04E23,GEORGE,What?
S04E23,DANA,It's like a discoloration. It's white.
S04E23,GEORGE,"(gets up and picks a mirror) Yes. Yes, it's white. Why it's white."
S04E23,DANA,You'd better get that checked out.
S04E23,GEORGE,Better get that checked out?
S04E23,DANA,I would.
S04E23,GEORGE,"What kind of a therapist are you? I'm telling I'm scared that something terrible is gonna happen to me, right away you start looking for tumors?"
S04E23,DANA,I'm trying to help you.
S04E23,GEORGE,"What are you like a sadist? No matter how bad somebody feels, you can make 'em feel worse. I bet you're rooting for a tumor. (pointing to her)"
S04E23,DANA,I think you'd better go.
S04E23,GEORGE,Oh I'm going baby! I'm going! (he leaves)
S04E23,[setting,Jerry and George in a cab at a light]
S04E23,JERRY,Where?
S04E23,GEORGE,Right here. (showing his lip)
S04E23,JERRY,"Get out of here, it's nothing. (Jerry knows George is hypochondriac. See 'The Heart Attack')"
S04E23,GEORGE,"(to the cab driver) Excuse me, do you see anything on my lip here?"

S04E23,JERRY,Would you stop?
S04E23,CABBIE,I would get that checked out if I were you.
S04E23,GEORGE,"Again with the checked out. I'm not going to the doctor. If I don't to the doctor, then nothing will happen to me. If I go he might find something."
S04E23,JERRY,"If you go, maybe they'll catch it in time."
S04E23,GEORGE,Catch what in time?
S04E23,JERRY,Whatever it is.
S04E23,GEORGE,You think it's something?
S04E23,CABBIE,"Ah! I hate these bums with their filthy rags. No no no, I don't want it, get away, get away from my car (he starts his wipers)"

S04E23,STU,(to George) Yeah I think I see it. It's like a white discoloration.
S04E23,GEORGE,(to Jay) What do you think it is?

S04E23,JAY,He must be worried about the fall schedule.
S04E23,STU,"Ah, it's a real bear."
S04E23,GEORGE,Yeah. So what's going on? We're gonna shoot the pilot and then it's gonna be on TV the following week?
S04E23,STU,Yeah. Right.
S04E23,CASTING DIRECTOR,"This is Mark Matts. He'll be auditioning for the role of George. (the guy looks very cool and casual, and has a lot of hair)"
S04E23,MARK,Hey how you doing?
S04E23,JERRY,(thinking) They've gotta be kidding.
S04E23,GEORGE,(thinking) This guy's perfect.
S04E23,CASTING DIRECTOR,O.K. Let's read this. I'll be reading Jerry's part.
S04E23,MARK,Anyone call for Vandelay Industries? (George is the only one in the room to find Mark funny)
S04E23,CASTING DIRECTOR,No. Why?
S04E23,MARK,"Listen to me. I told the unemployment office I was close to a job with Vandelay Industries and I gave them your phone number. So, when you answer the phone now, you've got to say ""Vandelay Industries""."
S04E23,CASTING DIRECTOR,I'm Vandelay Industries?
S04E23,MARK,Right.
S04E23,CASTING DIRECTOR,What is that?
S04E23,MARK,You're in latex.
S04E23,CASTING DIRECTOR,What do I do with latex?
S04E23,MARK,"I don't know, you manufacture it."
S04E23,CASTING DIRECTOR,"This is Michael Barth. Another George. (he's in sweat pants, bald, with glasses)"
S04E23,ALL,Hi Michael. How you doing?
S04E23,JERRY,Everything all right?
S04E23,MICHAEL,"I just came from the podiatrist. I have a mole on my foot. I've got a little gangrene, they're probably gonna have to amputate. (everyone laugh except George)"
S04E23,CASTING DIRECTOR,Any questions?
S04E23,MICHAEL,Yeah. What are we looking at here? Is this guy like a real loser?
S04E23,GEORGE,"No, not a loser!"
S04E23,CASTING DIRECTOR,Let's start with the second scene. You have it here?
S04E23,MICHAEL,"A man gave me a, you know, massage. (everyone laugh except George)"
S04E23,CASTING DIRECTOR,So?
S04E23,MICHAEL,"Well, he-- he had his hands, you know, and uh, he was, huh, ..."
S04E23,CASTING DIRECTOR,He was what?
S04E23,MICHAEL,He was you know... he was touching and rubbing. (loud laughter)
S04E23,CASTING DIRECTOR,That's a massage.
S04E23,MICHAEL,I think it moved.
S04E23,CASTING DIRECTOR,This is Melissa Shannon.
S04E23,MELISSA,Hi.
S04E23,ALL,Hi. How you doing.
S04E23,CASTING DIRECTOR,Melissa is reading for Elaine.
S04E23,MELISSA,"It's like a bald convention out there! (she saw George) Sorry. I, uh, made a faux pas."
S04E23,JERRY,No you didn't. He knows he's bald.
S04E23,MELISSA,"So how about that guy wearing sweat pants? I mean did he do that for the part or does he walk around like that? (Jerry approves with a nod, George drops his notepad on the coffee table)"
S04E23,CASTING DIRECTOR,O.K. Shall we start? (Melissa and the casting director sit down)
S04E23,JERRY,"(getting up) Uh, you know what? I'll read with her."
S04E23,MELISSA,"Oh, great."
S04E23,JERRY,"Alright, want to start?"
S04E23,MELISSA,Yeah.
S04E23,JERRY,O.K.
S04E23,MELISSA,Ahem. What was that look?
S04E23,JERRY,What look?
S04E23,MELISSA,That look you just gave me?
S04E23,JERRY,I gave a look?
S04E23,MELISSA,Yes.
S04E23,GEORGE,Thank you! Thank you very much. (Jerry and Melissa stop and look at George)
S04E23,CASTING DIRECTOR,Let's see some more Kramers.
S04E23,ALL,Hi. How you doing?
S04E23,TOM,(to Jerry and very seriously) How you doing?
S04E23,JERRY,(smiling and surprised at the way Tom is talking) Good.
S04E23,CASTING DIRECTOR,What is this about?
S04E23,TOM,(standing) Levels.
S04E23,CASTING DIRECTOR,Levels?
S04E23,TOM,"Yeah. I'm getting rid of all, all my furniture. All of it! I'm building... levels... with steps... completely carpeted... (making the gesture of carpeting steps) with pillows. (everyone laugh. He sits down) Like Ancient Egypt."
S04E23,CASTING DIRECTOR,I don't know how you're gonna be comfortable like that?
S04E23,TOM,"Oh! I'll be comfortable. (laughter, applause. He gets up, goes to the coffee table)"
S04E23,GEORGE,Very nice
S04E23,JERRY,Very good
S04E23,GEORGE,"Very nice Tom, that was terrific."
S04E23,TOM,May I? (pointing the box of raisins)
S04E23,GEORGE,Sure. Thank you for coming in. (Tom eats some raisins)
S04E23,JERRY,(to George) It was a wonderful reading.
S04E23,GEORGE,Yeah. Really.
S04E23,TOM,"Well, bye."
S04E23,GEORGE,Take care. Take it easy. (Tom leaves with the casting director)
S04E23,STU,"Now, I thought he was really good, very funny."
S04E23,JERRY,"Yeah, I liked him."
S04E23,GEORGE,What happened to the raisins?
S04E23,JAY,"Yeah, there was a box of raisins there!"
S04E23,GEORGE,Did he just steal the raisins?
S04E23,STU,You think he stole them?
S04E23,CASTING DIRECTOR,(enters with the real Kramer) This is Martin Van Nostrand.
S04E23,JERRY,(to Kramer) What are you doing here?
S04E23,CASTING DIRECTOR,You two know each other?
S04E23,STU,"Wait a minute, I know you. You're the guy from the Calvin Klein underwear ads."
S04E23,KRAMER,That's true.
S04E23,KRAMER,"(acting very bad) I saw Joe DiMaggio in Dinky Doughnuts again, but this time, I went in. (pause, stops acting) Oh! Uh, where's the bathroom?"
S04E23,STU,"I think if you go down the hall, it's on the right at the very end."
S04E23,KRAMER,Yeah. Be right back. (Kramer leaves)
S04E23,"(We see Kramer, groaning and holding his stomach, running down the hall, and opening the bathroom's door. Someone in there says","""Sorry buddy, full house."" We then see Kramer outside leaving the building and running across the street to a restaurant ""Sorry, customers only"" ...running into a movie theater ""Hey you need a ticket!"" ...running through the park...)"
S04E23,[setting,Monk's]
S04E23,ELAINE,So who's playing Elaine?
S04E23,JERRY,"Oh, don't worry about it. Very talented, very takented young actress."
S04E23,ELAINE,Really?
S04E23,JERRY,Yes.
S04E23,ELAINE,Who is it?
S04E23,JERRY,"She's an eskimo, actually."
S04E23,ELAINE,"Oh, my God (not in the mood to be kidding)"
S04E23,JERRY,"She came down from Juno by sleigh, she was in the Iditarod. Got to the finish line, just kept going. She's got the dogs with her in the hotel room."
S04E23,ELAINE,"Listen, was Russell at the casting?"
S04E23,JERRY,"No, he didn't show up."
S04E23,ELAINE,"You know, I'm a little bit worried about him. I don't understand. We had one date two months ago. Am I that charming and beautiful?"
S04E23,JERRY,No. No you're not.
S04E23,ELAINE,Why do I keep setting you up?
S04E23,JERRY,I don't know.
S04E23,ELAINE,"(to the waitress) Could we get a little more? (she doesn't listen and walks away) Aghh... You know ever since this new owner took over, the service here is *really* slow."
S04E23,JERRY,Yeah. Have you noticed anything else that's different since the new management?
S04E23,ELAINE,Mmm. They're putting a little lemon in the tuna. I love that.
S04E23,JERRY,Beside that. Look at the waitresses.
S04E23,ELAINE,Yeah? (we see that all the waitresses have big breasts)
S04E23,JERRY,What physical characteristic would you say is common to all of them?
S04E23,ELAINE,Ah...
S04E23,JERRY,I mean look at this. Every waitress working here has the same proportions. Wouldn't you say?
S04E23,ELAINE,"Yes, I would say."
S04E23,JERRY,What's going on here. How is that possible?
S04E23,ELAINE,Do you think it's a coincidence?
S04E23,JERRY,No. I haven't seen four women like this together outside of a Russ Meyer film.
S04E23,ELAINE,(to the waitress) Hi. Excuse me. Who does all the hiring waitresses here?
S04E23,WAITRESS,"He does. (pointing to the manager, Mr. Visaki) In fact we're looking for another girl if you know anyone. (she walks away)"
S04E23,ELAINE,"You know what? That's discriminatory. That is unfair. Why should these women have all the advantages? It's not enough they get all the attention from men, they have to get all the waitress jobs, too?"
S04E23,JERRY,Hey that's life. Good-looking men have the same advantages. You don't see any handsome homeless.
S04E23,[setting,doctor's clinic]
S04E23,GEORGE,"You see, It's right here. It's all white..."
S04E23,DOCTOR,Oh yeah. Yeah. I've never seen this before.
S04E23,GEORGE,You've never seen this before?
S04E23,DOCTOR,I'm gonna have to take a biopsy on that. (George grabs the doctor's arm)
S04E23,GEORGE,(dramatically) A what?
S04E23,DOCTOR,A biopsy.
S04E23,GEORGE,A biopsy?
S04E23,DOCTOR,Yeah.
S04E23,GEORGE,Cancer? Is it cancer? Do I have cancer?
S04E23,DOCTOR,Well I don't know what it is.
S04E23,[setting,Jerry's]
S04E23,GEORGE,A biopsy!
S04E23,JERRY,What did he say?
S04E23,GEORGE,He said he didn't know what it was.
S04E23,JERRY,Alright. So?
S04E23,GEORGE,"When I asked him if it was cancer, he didn't give me a ""get outta here"". That's what I wanted to hear ""Cancer? Get outta here?"""
S04E23,JERRY,"Well, maybe he doesn't have a ""get outta here"" kind of personality."
S04E23,GEORGE,"How could you be a doctor and not say ""get outta here""? It should be part of the training at medical school ""Cancer? Get outta here!"" ""Go home! What are you crazy? It's a little test. It's nothing. You're a real nut. You know that?"" (Jerry gives him half of his sandwich to hopefully shut him up) I told you that God would never let me be successful. I never should've written that pilot. Now the show will be a big hit, we'll make millions of dollars, and I'll be dead. Dead Jerry. Because of this. (showing his lip)"
S04E23,JERRY,Can't you at least die with a little dignity?
S04E23,GEORGE,No I can't. I can't die with dignity. I have no dignity. I want to be the one person who doesn't die with dignity. I live my whole life in shame. Why should I die with dignity?
S04E23,JERRY,Hey. What happened to you yesterday?
S04E23,KRAMER,I got mugged.
S04E23,GEORGE,You got mugged?
S04E23,JERRY,Mugged?
S04E23,KRAMER,"Well, I wouldn't have minded it so much but I was running home to go to the bathroom."
S04E23,JERRY,Why didn't you use the bathroom in the building?
S04E23,KRAMER,"It was full. I tried a few other places, you know, but that didn't work. I mean it was an emergency Jerrry. I was really percolating... So I decided to run home through the park and then these two guys they stopped me and..."
S04E23,JERRY,Yeah?
S04E23,ELAINE,It's me.
S04E23,JERRY,Come on up.
S04E23,KRAMER,"But now I have a big problem, buddy."
S04E23,JERRY,What is it?
S04E23,KRAMER,"Well, I waited so long I-- I missed my chance."
S04E23,JERRY,You didn't go?
S04E23,KRAMER,No. And now I can't get it back.
S04E23,JERRY,The % thing to do is just not think about it.
S04E23,KRAMER,How could you not think about it?
S04E23,ELAINE,Hey.
S04E23,KRAMER,(mumbles and leaves)
S04E23,ELAINE,What's the matter with him?
S04E23,JERRY,He's a little backed up.
S04E23,ELAINE,Oh...
S04E23,GEORGE,Elaine.
S04E23,ELAINE,So I spoke to some of my sisters about that coffee shop.
S04E23,JERRY,"Oh, the sisters (he sits at the table)"
S04E23,GEORGE,(to Jerry) Have you seen the waitresses in there lately? I never had so much coffee in my life.
S04E23,ELAINE,So we decided I should go over there and apply for a job myself.
S04E23,GEORGE,Apply for a job? What for?
S04E23,ELAINE,"Because, it's discriminatory (she comes back wearing one of Jerry's shirts, untucked)"
S04E23,GEORGE,It's a coincidence.
S04E23,JERRY,This is what you gonna wear?
S04E23,ELAINE,Yeah.
S04E23,JERRY,You're not gonna get the job.
S04E23,ELAINE,Exactly.
S04E23,JERRY,"(to the phone) Hello. Oh, hi. Yeah I guess we could do that. At what time? All right. I'll see you there. O.K., bye. (hangs up)"
S04E23,ELAINE,Who was it?
S04E23,JERRY,TV Elaine. She wants to get together and talk about the part.
S04E23,ELAINE,What about the dogs?
S04E23,JERRY,They're having sex in the hotel room.
S04E23,[setting,"Peter McManus cafe, same table as earlier]"
S04E23,(Jerry and TV Elaine,Sandi Robbins)
S04E23,SANDI,"So, the Elaine character is based on someone you know."
S04E23,JERRY,Yes.
S04E23,SANDI,And she's really your ex-girlfriend?
S04E23,JERRY,"Uh, Huh, yeah."
S04E23,SANDI,I want to get to know her from the inside. What is she like? Tell me about her.
S04E23,JERRY,"Well, she's fascinated with Greenland. She enjoys teasing animals, banlon, and seeing people running for their lives. She loves throwing garbage out the window, yet she's extremely dainty."
S04E23,SANDI,How would she eat a hamburger?
S04E23,JERRY,With her hands.
S04E23,SANDI,What about pasta?
S04E23,JERRY,Also with her hands.
S04E23,SANDI,Seriously... I want to experience everything she's experienced.
S04E23,JERRY,Everything?
S04E23,SANDI,Everything.
S04E23,JERRY,All right she cuts her pasta with a knife.
S04E23,SANDI,That's good. What's her favorite movie?
S04E23,JERRY,Shaft.
S04E23,SANDI,You got to get me a picture. What about sex?
S04E23,JERRY,She likes talking during sex.
S04E23,SANDI,Oh... dirty talking?
S04E23,JERRY,"No. Just chitchat, movies, current events, regular stuff. You know Sandi-- (looking at his watch)"
S04E23,SANDI,Elaine.
S04E23,JERRY,What?
S04E23,SANDI,Call me Elaine.
S04E23,JERRY,All right. Elaine.
S04E23,SANDI,How does Elaine kiss?
S04E23,JERRY,Well--
S04E23,SANDI,Does she kiss... like this? (she kisses Jerry)
S04E23,JERRY,"Actually she has a thing where she spirals her tongue around, it's like--"
S04E23,SANDI,Like this? (kisses again but with the spiral)
S04E23,JERRY,I think you got it.

S04E23,TOM,I'll have a hamburger. That's it.
S04E23,KRAMER,"Yeah, that's good. Oh, now I like to play golf."
S04E23,TOM,"This stuff doesn't matter to me. See, I'm gonna do the character like me, not like you."
S04E23,KRAMER,You gotta play him like me. I'm Kramer.
S04E23,TOM,I'm Kramer.
S04E23,KRAMER,"Whoa, I'm Kramer."
S04E23,Mr. VISAKI,(foreign accent) What can I do for you? Would you like a table.
S04E23,ELAINE,"No, I'd like to apply for a waitress job."
S04E23,Mr. VISAKI,(looks Elaine up and down) Have you ever waited on tables before.
S04E23,ELAINE,"Oh yeah. I've been a professional waitress for the last 10 years. I've worked all over the city. These, uh, are my references. I'm sure you'll find that I'm more than qualified."
S04E23,Mr. VISAKI,I don't think I need anyone else right now.
S04E23,ELAINE,You're in big trouble mister. And I mean trouble with a capital 'T'. (she leaves)

S04E23,FRED,"Anyway, go on."
S04E23,ELAINE,"Um... Well, there's not really much more to tell. He was looking for waitresses, and I went in to apply for the job. And, he looked me up and down and he rejected me."

S04E24,GEORGE,Oh yeah.
S04E24,JERRY,Did he take 'em?
S04E24,GEORGE,I don't know.
S04E24,JERRY,"Well if he didn't take 'em, what happened to 'em?"
S04E24,GEORGE,That's what I'm trying to find out.
S04E24,JERRY,Hey.
S04E24,KRAMER,Hey.
S04E24,JERRY,Any luck?
S04E24,KRAMER,"No. No, nothing. I got no... peristalsis."
S04E24,JERRY,What about bran?
S04E24,KRAMER,"I tried bran-- 40%, 50% 100%. The bran isn't working for me."
S04E24,JERRY,"Well my friend, (Jerry puts his hand on Kramer's shoulder) it may be time to consider the dreaded apparatus."
S04E24,KRAMER,"Pfft! Hold it right there. If you're suggesting what I think you're suggesting, you're wasting your time. I am not Jerry, under any circumstances, doing any inserting in that area."
S04E24,JERRY,"Oh, it's not that bad!"
S04E24,GEORGE,Yes it is.
S04E24,ELAINE,Well it's all taken care of. I filed a report. An investigation is underway.
S04E24,JERRY,"(to Elaine) So, you going to the taping tomorrow night?"
S04E24,ELAINE,No. I don't think I should go. I really don't wanna bump into Russell. He called me the other day. He won't quit.
S04E24,JERRY,"Oh, come on you gotta go! He's harmless. He's got a little crush on you."
S04E24,ELAINE,"Jerry, this is not a crush. This is a complete fixation. he makes me very uncomfortable."
S04E24,JERRY,We need you there!
S04E24,ELAINE,(to Kramer) Hey are you gonna go?
S04E24,KRAMER,No. No. I'm gonna stay home. I want to be close to my home base in case there's any news from the front. (he leaves)
S04E24,[setting,"NBC, pilot's set, the taping]"
S04E24,SANDI,(to her hairdresser) No! Pick it up more in the front! It's got to be higher! Higher! Make a wall! A wall!
S04E24,ASSISTANT DRESSER,"Sandi, are you in wardrobe? Sandi?"
S04E24,JERRY,Try Elaine.
S04E24,ASSISTANT DRESSER,Elaine?
S04E24,SANDI,Yes?
S04E24,WILTON,Elaine? It's me-- Wilton Marshall. Remember? Camp Tioga-- 1978? Remember?
S04E24,ELAINE,"Oh, right."
S04E24,WILTON,Wow! You know you haven't changed a bit.
S04E24,MICHAEL,I can't remember my lines!!!
S04E24,JERRY,"Just relax, you'll be fine."
S04E24,MICHAEL,I can't relax. I don't know what line! I don't know any of 'em!
S04E24,JERRY,You're just like George. George'd do the same thing. You're just like him. It's amazing!
S04E24,MICHAEL,Help me Jerry! Help me!
S04E24,RITA,(to Stu) Where is Russell?
S04E24,STU,You know I don't know. I thought he was coming. I assumed he wouldn't miss it.
S04E24,JAY,He hasn't been well.
S04E24,STU,(to Rita) Can I tell you something in confidence? I think it's a woman.
S04E24,RITA,How pathetic.
S04E24,GEORGE,"This is George Costanza, I'm calling for my test results. Negative? Oh, my God. WHY! WHY! WHY? What? What? Negative is good? Oh, yes of course! How stupid of me. Thank you. Thank you very much. (he hangs up)"
S04E24,GEORGE,"(he walks casually to Tom, and taps his arm) Listen. I know we've had our problems in the past, but we got a show to do tonight. Time to pull together as a team. Life's too short. I say, let's let bygones be bygones. If you took the raisins, if you didn't take the raisins-- They weren't even my raisins. I was just curious because it seems like a strange to do to walk into a room, audition, and to walk out with a box of raisins. Anyway, whatever. If you ever want to tell me about it, the door to my office is always opened. In the event that I get an office. You'll come in, we'll talk about the raisins. We'll have a nice laugh."
S04E24,TOM,"How would you like it if I just pulled your heart out of your chest right now, and shoved it down your throat?"
S04E24,PAT HAZELL,Are you ready to meet our cast? (crowd applause) All right.
S04E24,JERRY,"Good evening, folks. How you doing? (small reaction from the crowd) Well, you sound like a great crowd. We have a show we're gonna put on for you tonight. It's a new TV show. It's what they call a pilot. And we hope it becomes a series. It's called 'Jerry', and I'm playing Jerry--"
S04E24,JOE DEVOLA,(getting up then shouting) SIC SEMPER TYRANNIS! (he jumps over a balcony and on the stage. The crowd is yelling)
S04E24,[setting,Jerry's]
S04E24,GEORGE,"Sic semper tyrannis? What is that, Latin?"
S04E24,JERRY,"Yeah, it's what John Wilkes Booth yelled out when he shot Lincoln."
S04E24,GEORGE,Really? What does it mean?
S04E24,JERRY,"It means ""Death to tyrants""."
S04E24,GEORGE,I can see that.
S04E24,ELAINE,"See, now this is exciting! This is exciting! Did I miss anything already?"
S04E24,JERRY,"No, it starts in five minutes. You were there at the taping, what's the big deal?"
S04E24,ELAINE,"Nah, now it's on TV. It's different. I told everybody I know to watch it."
S04E24,GEORGE,"Yeah, me too."
S04E24,JERRY,"Hey, what about Russell? Did you hear from him?"
S04E24,ELAINE,No.
S04E24,JERRY,Strange. Even not showing up at the taping...
S04E24,KRAMER,"Hey, pistol-packin mama, you swing that gal around, Allemande left with the old gray hag, around and around you go. Yee-ha!!"
S04E24,JERRY,"Well, well, well."
S04E24,ELAINE,Congratulations.
S04E24,KRAMER,"Well, thank you."
S04E24,GEORGE,"You went for the big ""E""."
S04E24,KRAMER,Wet and wild.
S04E24,JERRY,All right. Come on sit down. It's about to start.
S04E24,KRAMER,"Oh, yes."
S04E24,ELAINE,"Hey, what's this? Look. A wallet."
S04E24,JERRY,A wallet? Let me see that.
S04E24,ELAINE,Here.
S04E24,JERRY,"Ah, man! It's my father's wallet! The one he thought they stole at the doctor's office that time."
S04E24,GEORGE,Shh! This is it!
S04E24,JERRY,How do you like that?
S04E24,(The show begins. There are three different settings while the show is on TV. Each line or description will be preceded by the right setting,
S04E24,"(Jerry's doing his stand-up routine at a comedy club. There's the music theme and we don't hear what he is saying, but the closed captions put that",
S04E24,"We see the title 'Jerry', then, sitting at the comedy club, we see",
S04E24,"Micheal, Sandi, and Tom, and finally Jerry, and the four of them make a toast while it's written","""Created by Jerry Seinfeld and George Costanza""."
S04E24,ELAINE,Bravo!
S04E24,GEORGE,You hurt me.
S04E24,MICHAEL,Hey.
S04E24,JERRY,Hey George.
S04E24,MICHAEL,New sneakers?
S04E24,JERRY,Yeah.
S04E24,MICHAEL,What do you need new sneakers for?
S04E24,JERRY,I like sneakers.
S04E24,MICHAEL,How do you make a decision which one to wear? I'd go crazy if I have to decide which sneakers to wear every day.
S04E24,JERRY,"Nah, you're crazy anyway."
S04E24,SUSAN AND ALLSION,(to each other while they recognize one of George's behaviors in Michael) George!
S04E24,SID,What kind of stupid show is this? Hey! It's that idiot that took all my records! (the houskeeper starts laughing)
S04E24,MARLA,"John, what are you doing? Come back to bed."
S04E24,JOHN,(with a Boston accent) This show looks interesting. Isn't he that Seinfeld fellow you went out with?
S04E24,MARLA,"Ooh, he's horrible! Horrible!"
S04E24,JOHN,Nevertheless...
S04E24,THE DRAKE,"Ah, that Jerry's a funny guy. Huh? Got to love the Sein!"
S04E24,ALLSION,Hate the Sein! (while she adjusts the tiny antenna)
S04E24,PING,I can't believe you liked him.
S04E24,CHERYL,I thought he was dark and disturbed.
S04E24,PING,Real perceptive.
S04E24,DONALD,This is a piece of crap!
S04E24,MOTHER,"Donald, you used to like him."
S04E24,DONALD,What a sellout! Give me that remote!
S04E24,MEL,"No, Donald."
S04E24,KRAMER,"Come on Jerry, the commercials almost over."
S04E24,JERRY,All right.
S04E24,ELAINE,You know Jerry I really like this guy who's playing the butler.
S04E24,JERRY,Oh yeah. He's good. You know he's John Ritter's cousin.
S04E24,ELAINE,Really?
S04E24,JERRY,Yeah.
S04E24,JERRY,"Hello, Charles."
S04E24,CHARLES,"Hello. So, where do you want me to start today?"
S04E24,JERRY,Why don't you start in the bedroom?
S04E24,CHARLES,"(to himself, upset) Start in the bedroom..."
S04E24,TOM,Hey.
S04E24,JERRY,Hey. The butler's here.
S04E24,TOM,"He is? Listen. When he's finished, send him over to my house."
S04E24,JERRY,I'm not sending him to your house.
S04E24,TOM,Why not?
S04E24,JERRY,"Because the judge decreed he'd become my butler, not my friend's butler."
S04E24,TOM,"Jerry, he is your butler. You can give him any order you want. That's what butlers do."
S04E24,JERRY,But I don't want to.
S04E24,KRAMER,"Jerry, my house is a pigsty, come on."
S04E24,JERRY,Yeah?
S04E24,SANDI,(from the buzzer's speaker) It's Elaine.
S04E24,JERRY,Come on up.
S04E24,CHARLES,I need more Pledge.
S04E24,JERRY,More Pledge! I just bought two cans last week and I don't even have any wood in the house!
S04E24,CHARLES,"Well, it goes fast."
S04E24,SANDI,"(to Charles, very friendly) Hello."
S04E24,CHARLES,Hello. (he goes back in the bedroom)
S04E24,JERRY,What's all this about?
S04E24,SANDI,We had a date.
S04E24,JERRY,You had a date? You went out with my butler? Who said you could go out with my butler?
S04E24,SANDI,Why do I need your permission?
S04E24,JERRY,Because he's my butler!
S04E24,MORTY,That's terrific!
S04E24,HELEN,How could anyone not like him?
S04E24,C.K.,I like his style. He has a sort of casual elegance.
S04E24,TIA,But he picks his nose.
S04E24,C.K.,Nevertheless...
S04E24,SAL BASS,He's a member of our health club. Isn't he?
S04E24,SIDRA,Yeah...
S04E24,SAL BASS,You know that Kim Novak has some big breasts?
S04E24,JERRY,Ever notice a lot of butlers are named Jeeves?
S04E24,JERRY,"You know I think when you name a baby Jeeves, you've pretty much mapped out his future, wouldn't you say? Not much chance is gonna be a hitman I think after that. (with a British accent) ""Terribly sorry Sir, but I'm going to have to whack you""."
S04E24,[setting,back to Jerry's]
S04E24,ALL,(applauding and shaking hands) Wooh! Yeah!
S04E24,ELAINE,Wow! That was great! That show was so funny. It was really funny. I'm not just saying that cause I know you. Honestly.
S04E24,JERRY,Let's go out and celebrate! (they all get up)
S04E24,ELAINE,That was so good.
S04E24,JERRY,Come on let's eat something. (phone rings)
S04E24,ELAINE,You know what I think this thing is gonna get picked up George. You guys are gonna be rich!
S04E24,GEORGE,Do you really think so?
S04E24,ELAINE,Oh yeah.
S04E24,GEORGE,And God didn't kill me.
S04E24,JERRY,(to the phone) Hello?
S04E24,RITA,"Hi Jerry, this is Rita Kierson."
S04E24,JERRY,"Oh, hi Rita."
S04E24,RITA,I'm calling to let you know that Russell Dalrimple is no longer with this network.
S04E24,JERRY,"Oh, my God. Did he get fired?"
S04E24,RITA,To be honest with you. Nobody really knows. He seems to have disappeared.
S04E24,JERRY,Russell's disappeared?
S04E24,RITA,"In any event, I've been made the new president of NBC. As you may or may not know, Russell and I did not see eye to eye on many, many projects. And as my first order of business, I'm, uh, passing on your show."
S04E24,JERRY,You're passing already? But the show just ended two minutes ago!
S04E24,RITA,"Well, I just got the job. Goodbye, Jerry."
S04E24,JERRY,"Yeah, see ya. (he hangs up)"
S04E24,ELAINE,What-- What are you looking at me for?
S04E24,GEORGE,It was you!
S04E24,ELAINE,What did I do?
S04E24,JERRY,Do you realize his obsession with you cost us a TV series?
S04E24,ELAINE,"I didn't know that he'd fall for me and I'd drive him insane. I mean, you know, that's not my fault."
S04E24,GEORGE,Yes it is! You're very charming!
S04E24,ELAINE,I can't believe this? What happened to him? Where the hell is he?
S04E24,JERRY,No one knows.
S04E24,[setting,"Greenpeace raft on the ocean, following a whaler]"
S04E24,RUSSELL,"She works for Pendant Publishing. She's the most beautiful woman I've ever seen. You know, I used to work for NBC, but when I go back to her this time, she'll respect me."
S04E24,MAN ON RAFT,You'd better get down. They might start firing soon. (harpoon fires)
S04E24,[setting,Monk's]
S04E24,JERRY,Hey look at this. What is going on here?
S04E24,GEORGE,"Well, well, well."
S04E24,ELAINE,"Nothing has changed. How did this happen? (she sees the two guys of the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission at a table) Ah, these are the two guys I talked to at the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission. Hey! What are you two guys doing here? I thought you were gonna do something about this. Now you're eating here?"
S04E24,FRED,Oh no. That's why we're here. We're checking things out.
S04E24,PAUL,"Yeah, we're checking it out."
S04E24,ELAINE,(to Paul) You're checking it out?
S04E24,MAN,"(to Fred and Paul) See you back at the office, guys."
S04E24,Mr. VISAKI,"Fred, Paul, lunch and dinner? Boy, you guys ought to move in. How about a piece of pie on me? Sophia! Take care of these fellows."
S04E24,ELAINE,(to the manager) Hey! Come here a second. I want you to know something. You are not gonna get away with this!
S04E24,Mr. VISAKI,Get away with what?
S04E24,ELAINE,"Ah, ""with what?"" You know what. With the waitresses. How they're all... alike."
S04E24,Mr. VISAKI,Of course they're alike. They're my daughters.
S04E24,ELAINE,"(embarrassed, but smiling) Oh, your daughters."
S04E24,GEORGE,"You must be very proud Mr. Visaki. (shaking his hand) And may I say sir they're lovely girls, absolutely lovely girls. It's nice to see such fine upstanding women in gainful employment, Mr. Visaki."
S04E24,Mr. VISAKI,"Oh, here's a table for you."
S04E24,GEORGE,A table right here.
S04E24,Mr. VISAKI,Peggy!
S04E24,GEORGE,Peggy! (they all sit) His daughter Peggy. Peggy's coming over to serve.
S04E24,JERRY,What a family!
S04E24,Mr. VISAKI,My daughter Peggy.
S04E24,GEORGE,Ah! Peggy. Good to see you.
S04E24,ELAINE,Hi Peggy.
S04E24,GEORGE,Thank you very much. (Peggy leaves the menus and walks away) So guess what I got do tomorrow?
S04E24,JERRY,What?
S04E24,GEORGE,Start looking for a job.
S04E24,KRAMER,You know what you ought to do George? You should work for Greenpeace. You those people they attack the whalers out on the open sea.
S04E24,GEORGE,Are you crazy? You take your life in your hands with those nuts.

S05E01,JERRY,"So, what's her name?"
S05E01,GEORGE,Karen.
S05E01,JERRY,Is she nice?
S05E01,GEORGE,Great.
S05E01,JERRY,So you like her?
S05E01,GEORGE,I think so.
S05E01,JERRY,You don't know?
S05E01,GEORGE,I can't tell anymore.
S05E01,JERRY,Well do you feel anything?
S05E01,GEORGE,Feel? What's that?
S05E01,JERRY,"All right, let me ask you this when she comes over, you're cleaning up a lot?"
S05E01,GEORGE,Yeah.
S05E01,JERRY,You're just straightening up or you're cleaning?
S05E01,GEORGE,Cleaning
S05E01,JERRY,You do the tub?
S05E01,GEORGE,Yeah.
S05E01,JERRY,"On your knees, Ajax, hands scrubbin', the whole deal?"
S05E01,GEORGE,"Yeah, yeah."
S05E01,JERRY,"Okay, I think you're in love!"
S05E01,GEORGE,Tub is love?
S05E01,JERRY,Tub is love.
S05E01,GEORGE,Hah.
S05E01,JERRY,So there you are. You've got a nice girl and a clean apartment.
S05E01,GEORGE,Yep. There's one liiiittle problem.
S05E01,JERRY,Sexual?
S05E01,GEORGE,Yeeeaaah. (Jerry and George lean in to make their conversation a little more private) Well..... I've never really felt confident in uh..... one particular aspect.
S05E01,JERRY,Below the equator?
S05E01,GEORGE,Yeah.
S05E01,JERRY,"Nobody does. You know, nobody knows what to do. You just close your eyes and you hope for the best. I really think they're happy if you just make an effort."
S05E01,GEORGE,I-I don't know. Last time I got the tap.
S05E01,JERRY,You got the tap?
S05E01,GEORGE,"You know, you're going along, you think everything's all right and all of a sudden you get that tap. (George taps his own shoulder). You know it's like pfffff (whistling sound), all right that's enough, you're through."
S05E01,JERRY,The tap is tough.
S05E01,GEORGE,It's like the manager coming out and asking you for the ball.
S05E01,JERRY,Well maybe she just wanted to move on to other business.
S05E01,GEORGE,"No, no, this wasn't moving on. I got the hook. I wish I could get a lesson in that."
S05E01,JERRY,It's a very complicated area.
S05E01,GEORGE,You can go crazy trying to figure that place out.
S05E01,JERRY,It's a haaazy mystery.
S05E01,GEORGE,"Anyway, I think everything else is okay. Unless of course she's faking."
S05E01,ELAINE,Who's faking?
S05E01,GEORGE,Nothing.
S05E01,ELAINE,Faking what?
S05E01,GEORGE,Nobody's faking.
S05E01,ELAINE,Ah! Orgasm?
S05E01,GEORGE,She's not faking!
S05E01,ELAINE,How do you know?
S05E01,GEORGE,"I know. I can tell. It's one of my powers. Why, did you ever fake?"
S05E01,ELAINE,Of course.
S05E01,JERRY,Really?
S05E01,GEORGE,You faked?
S05E01,ELAINE,On occasion.
S05E01,JERRY,And the guy never knows?
S05E01,ELAINE,No.
S05E01,JERRY,How can he not know that?
S05E01,ELAINE,Because I was gooood.
S05E01,JERRY,I guess after that many beers he's probably a little groggy anyway.
S05E01,ELAINE,You didn't know.
S05E01,JERRY,What?
S05E01,ELAINE,You didn't know.
S05E01,JERRY,Are you saying...
S05E01,GEORGE,I think I'll have a piece of cake.
S05E01,JERRY,With me?
S05E01,ELAINE,Well...
S05E01,JERRY,You faked with me?
S05E01,ELAINE,Ye.
S05E01,JERRY,You faked with me?
S05E01,ELAINE,Yeass.
S05E01,JERRY,No.
S05E01,ELAINE,Yeass.
S05E01,JERRY,You faked it?
S05E01,ELAINE,I faked it.
S05E01,JERRY,"That whole thing, the whole production, it was all an act?"
S05E01,ELAINE,Not bad huh?
S05E01,JERRY,"What about the breathing, the panting, the moaning, the screaming?"
S05E01,ELAINE,"(points in the air as is to point out each things Jerry asked) Fake, fake, fake, fake."
S05E01,JERRY,"I'm stunned, I'm shocked! How many times did you do this?"
S05E01,ELAINE,"Uuuhm, all the time."
S05E01,JERRY,All the time?!
S05E01,GEORGE,We got a chocolate malt in here!
S05E01,JERRY,But I'm so good.
S05E01,GEORGE,I'm sure you are.
S05E01,ELAINE,"Jerry, listen, it wasn't you. I just didn't have 'em back then."
S05E01,JERRY,She faked.
S05E01,JERRY,Maybe they've all been faking.
S05E01,ELAINE,I'm sure they're not.
S05E01,GEORGE,Maybe Karen is faking.
S05E01,[location,Jerry's apartment]
S05E01,KRAMER,She was probably joking.
S05E01,JERRY,"No no, it was no joke."
S05E01,KRAMER,She didn't have any?
S05E01,JERRY,No. None.
S05E01,KRAMER,(raising hand) She faked 'em all.
S05E01,JERRY,(raising hand) Faked 'em all.
S05E01,KRAMER,"Well so she faked 'em, so what?"
S05E01,JERRY,The woman had an orgasm under false pretences. That's sexual perjury.
S05E01,KRAMER,You know I heard her screaming from my apartment? She woke me up a few times.
S05E01,JERRY,"How did she do it? She's like Meryl Streep this woman. And I had to work the equipment. I'm not unskilled, I'm in the union. If she'd at least told me, maybe I could have done something about it."
S05E01,KRAMER,Yeah I could have helped you out.
S05E01,JERRY,What could you have done?
S05E01,KRAMER,I could have given you some pointers. I know how to press those buttons buddy.
S05E01,JERRY,I'm feeling very inadequate about the whole thing.
S05E01,KRAMER,Aaaaah.
S05E01,JERRY,Don't aaaaah! I'm supposed to do something with her later? I don't even think I wanna see her.
S05E01,KRAMER,Giddy-up.
S05E01,JERRY,Hello... Oh hello Elaine.
S05E01,ELAINE,So we're having dinner tonight?
S05E01,JERRY,"I don't know, I'm not really in the mood."
S05E01,ELAINE,Why? What's wrong? You're not still thinking about this afternoon are you?
S05E01,JERRY,"What, the grilled cheese? Naaah, they always burn the toast."
S05E01,ELAINE,"Nooo, the other thing."
S05E01,JERRY,Oooh that. Well...
S05E01,ELAINE,"Oh come on, Jerry. Making to much of a big deal about it."
S05E01,JERRY,Yeah I guess. So you wanna meet at that place at seven thirty?
S05E01,ELAINE,Okay.
S05E01,JERRY,All right.
S05E01,ELAINE,"All right, see you later."
S05E01,JERRY,Bye.
S05E01,ELAINE,Bye.
S05E01,[location,Elaine's office]
S05E01,ELAINE,"Rene, can you come here a second? Let me ask you something Ummm, have you ever... you know... faked it?"
S05E01,RENE,"Yeah, sometimes."
S05E01,ELAINE,"Really, like when?"

S05E01,JERRY,I really don't feel like seeing her.
S05E01,KRAMER,"You know, I faked it."
S05E01,JERRY,(confused) What?!
S05E01,KRAMER,Yeah.
S05E01,JERRY,You faked it? Why would you do that?
S05E01,KRAMER,"Well you know, if it's enough already and I just wanna get some sleep."
S05E01,JERRY,"Yeah, but why would you... (Kramer is eating a peach then disgusted he spits it out) Bad peach?"
S05E01,KRAMER,It's terrible!
S05E01,JERRY,Did you get that at Joe's?
S05E01,KRAMER,"Yeah, of course I got it at Joe's."
S05E01,JERRY,"That's surprising, his fruit is usually the best."
S05E01,KRAMER,You know what I'm gonna do? (heading for the door) I'm gonna return this.
S05E01,JERRY,You're returning used fruit?
S05E01,KRAMER,Jerry this peach is sub par.
S05E01,[location,Joe's]
S05E01,JOE,So what do you want me to do?
S05E01,KRAMER,I want restitution.
S05E01,JOE,Restitution? You want restitution? Why should I give you restitution?
S05E01,KRAMER,Because it's no good.
S05E01,JOE,"When you put that fruit out, that's where it ends for me."
S05E01,KRAMER,"It's still your fruit, you gotta stand behind your fruit."
S05E01,JOE,I stand behind my fruit.
S05E01,KRAMER,So...
S05E01,JOE,"Hey, you got a bad peach? That's an act of God. He makes the peaches. I don't make the peaches, I sell the peaches. You have a problem? You talk to him."
S05E01,KRAMER,"You know this whole place is going vrrrrrrrrrrrrt, downhill. I could have come in here last week with a bad plum but I let it go."
S05E01,JOE,"Well let me put a solution for ya do your business elsewhere, I don't want your business."
S05E01,KRAMER,Oh now you don't want my business.
S05E01,JOE,"No, I don't want your business and from this moment you're banned from the store, you're banned!"
S05E01,KRAMER,But what am I gonna do for fruit?

S05E01,KAREN,"(moaning) Mmmmm, Mmmm, Hmmhmmhmmm (lights a cigarette) Mmmm (takes a puff) Woo"
S05E01,GEORGE,"(thinking of the moans) Heh. (Karen takes another puff of her cigarette) You seem like you really enjoyed your Risotto. (chuckles) You have a very contented air over there. (chuckles again) You look very contented, very satisfied. (pauses) Are you satisfied?"
S05E01,KAREN,I'm very satisfied.
S05E01,GEORGE,I-I'm sure if you weren't satisfied you would probably say something wouldn't you?
S05E01,KAREN,I probably would. But then again I'm an enigma.
S05E01,GEORGE,"Hey listen... umm, instead of the movie... uh, maybe we'll go back and uh you know...(nudges her head with his head)"
S05E01,KAREN,Maybe.
S05E01,GEORGE,So... uh you feel okay about that whole thing... what we do in there... you're generally okay with everything in there?
S05E01,KAREN,Generally.
S05E01,GEORGE,Do you uh feel the way you feel after the Risotto?
S05E01,KAREN,"Well no, I feel full after the Risotto."

S05E01,JERRY,"Ah, she's okay."
S05E01,ELAINE,"I love her Jerry, she's so authentic. I really believe everything is actually happening to her. There's no acting there."
S05E01,JERRY,Yeah. You don't want coffee or anything do you?

S05E01,JERRY,"Yeah, yeah, can we get off of this?"
S05E01,ELAINE,What's the matter?
S05E01,JERRY,Nothing.
S05E01,ELAINE,You're not still thinking about that are you?
S05E01,JERRY,Nooo.
S05E01,ELAINE,Oh good.
S05E01,JERRY,Give me another shot!
S05E01,ELAINE,(shocked) What?
S05E01,JERRY,"Another shot, I want another shot."
S05E01,ELAINE,You mean...?
S05E01,JERRY,Yes!
S05E01,ELAINE,"Oooh no, I don't think so."
S05E01,JERRY,"Come on! One shot, I can do it, I know I can do it!"
S05E01,ELAINE,"Jerry, we're friends! We can't do that, it would ruin our friendship."
S05E01,JERRY,"Oh friendship... friendship, shmanship ."
S05E01,ELAINE,"Jerry no, that's important to me."
S05E01,JERRY,We won't ruin the friendship.
S05E01,ELAINE,"Ya, Yes we will!"
S05E01,JERRY,Elaine...
S05E01,ELAINE,"No Jerry, it is out of the question. You know what sex does to a friendship, it kills it."
S05E01,JERRY,"A half hour, give me a half our."
S05E01,ELAINE,No!
S05E01,JERRY,"Okay, fifteen minutes. I guarantee you fifteen minutes, I can make it happen!"
S05E01,ELAINE,Noo!
S05E01,JERRY,You're worried I'll be able to do it aren't you?
S05E01,ELAINE,"What, no, it doesn't matter. Jerry, I don't care."
S05E01,JERRY,"That's it, that's it. You like having this over me, you don't want me to do it."
S05E01,ELAINE,That is so ridiculous.

S05E01,JERRY,Well good night.
S05E01,ELAINE,I still don't understand why we had to walk out on that movie.
S05E01,JERRY,"Oh that Meryl Streep, she's such a phony baloney."
S05E01,ELAINE,Goodnight. Thanks for a really fabulous evening (sarcastic).
S05E01,JERRY,"Oh what, you're upset?"
S05E01,ELAINE,"Yes I'm upset, can't you tell?"
S05E01,JERRY,"No I can't, maybe you're faking."
S05E01,ELAINE,"I'm really, really sorry I told you that."
S05E01,JERRY,I'm sorry too.

S05E01,GEORGE,"It's all your fault! You and Elaine! All that orgasm talk. She did have an orgasm, she didn't have an orgasm. Orgasm this, orgasm that. I got so focused on it. I started to panic and boom, I lost it. I tried everything, I was talking to him 'Please wake up, do something.'"
S05E01,JERRY,They're mysterious little fellows aren't they?
S05E01,GEORGE,I hate him!
S05E01,JERRY,You know it happens to everybody. It happened to Houdini. And he could get out of a trunk under water with his hands in chains! But he had a problem with that. The miracle is that it ever happens.
S05E01,GEORGE,It's like a magic trick. Sometimes I think it would be easier to bend a spoon mentally than to make that transformation.
S05E01,KRAMER,Hey.
S05E01,JERRY,Hey.
S05E01,KRAMER,"Hey listen, if I give you money would you go out and get me some fruit?"
S05E01,JERRY,Why can't you get it?
S05E01,KRAMER,Well I got banned from the store I can't go back in there now.
S05E01,JERRY,What happened?
S05E01,KRAMER,"Well you know, we had a fight over the peach and uh well Joe doesn't want my business."
S05E01,GEORGE,"Hey, was that a joke about Houdini?"
S05E01,JERRY,(to George) No. (to Kramer) I told you not to say anything.
S05E01,KRAMER,"Jerry, what am I gonna do for fruit?"
S05E01,JERRY,Well you'll have to go to the supermarket.
S05E01,KRAMER,"The supermarket? That's impossible! They don't have a decent piece of fruit at the supermarket. The apples are mealy, the oranges are dry. I don't know what's going on with the Papayas! Jerry you gotta go to Joe's, you gotta get me some fruit!"
S05E01,JERRY,Oh so what I'm going to buy all your fruit now?
S05E01,GEORGE,"Well if Houdini couldn't do it, what chance do I have?"
S05E01,JERRY,"Hello... Oh hi Patty, thanks for calling me back. I-I just wanted to ask you a question when we we're going out did you have orgasms?... Okay, thanks... No that's it... Ya, Okay, bye."
S05E01,JERRY,Patty Lawrence had 'em!
S05E01,KRAMER,"Alright look I'm gonna make you a fruit list, all right?"
S05E01,JERRY,Yeah.
S05E01,JERRY,Hello Elaine? Patty Lawrence had orgasms what do you think about that? And I got calls in to six other women and I bet you they confirm an orgasm too. So what do you have to say now Elaine?... Hello?
S05E01,[location,outside Joe's]
S05E01,JERRY,Why do I feel like I'm doing something wrong?
S05E01,KRAMER,All right now here's the list. (hands Jerry the list)
S05E01,JERRY,All this? It's too much. What do you need five mangos for?
S05E01,KRAMER,I like mangos.
S05E01,JERRY,Avocado? I don't know how to pick out an avocado.
S05E01,KRAMER,Well they gotta be soft.
S05E01,JERRY,How soft?
S05E01,KRAMER,Not too soft. Better too hard than too soft.
S05E01,JERRY,"(looking over the list) Hmm ah. I'm not going through this every week, I tell you that right now. And what are these? Plums? What is that?"
S05E01,KRAMER,Yeah now get the ones that are red on the inside.
S05E01,JERRY,Uh huh. Well how do I know what they look like on the inside? What do they look like on the outside?
S05E01,KRAMER,Oh! And get some plantains. (grabs the list to write them down)
S05E01,JERRY,Plantains?
S05E01,KRAMER,Yeah.
S05E01,JERRY,What the hell is a plantain.
S05E01,KRAMER,It's part of the banana family. It's a delicacy.
S05E01,JERRY,(grabbing the list from Kramer) You're not getting any plantains.
S05E01,JERRY,Hey Joe.
S05E01,JOE,How's it going?
S05E01,JERRY,"Good, just getting some fruit for myself. Uh, gotta have fruit in the house. I like it as a snack. Wholesome, natural, chock-full of vitamins. Alright let's see... mangos... four plums with red on the inside... avocado... (looks at Joe; Joe gives him a weird look)ooo, just right... and three plantains uh ought to do it."
S05E01,JOE,"All right, all right, just hold it right there."
S05E01,JERRY,What?
S05E01,JOE,This fruit isn't for you.
S05E01,JERRY,"(shocked) Wha, what are you talking about?"
S05E01,JOE,"You think I don't know huh? Mangos, plantains, plums with the red on the inside, that's Kramer!"
S05E01,JERRY,I can't buy mangos and plantains?
S05E01,JOE,"All right, get out!"
S05E01,JERRY,"You're making a big mistake, Joe!"
S05E01,JOE,I'll tell you something else I don't what your business anymore either.
S05E01,JERRY,Are saying you're banning me from the store?

S05E01,GEORGE,All right I gotta get going.
S05E01,JERRY,What are you doing?
S05E01,GEORGE,I got a date with Karen. I don't know what I'm gonna do. Nothing happening down there.
S05E01,JERRY,You're thinking about it too much. You're putting too much emphasis on it.
S05E01,GEORGE,I knew this was gonna happen some day. It was inevitable. I've known it ever since I was a little kid. I've been waiting for it.
S05E01,KRAMER,This mango is delicious!
S05E01,GEORGE,"That reminds me, I'm not getting you guys any more fruit. That guy was eyeballing me the whole time. He gave me the creeps. All right, you owe me twenty-eight sixty."
S05E01,JERRY,"Sorry, I don't have any cash."
S05E01,KRAMER,I only got hundreds.
S05E01,GEORGE,You see... All right I knew it.

S05E01,GEORGE,I don't want any mango.

S05E01,ELAINE,Yeah I got your fins. You got my poker chips?

S05E01,ELAINE,You know I'm a little hungry. You wouldn't happen to have any of that mango left?
S05E01,"The female orgasm is kinda like the bat cave, very few people know where it is and if you're lucky enough to see it you probably don't know how you got there and you can't find you way back after you left. There are two types of female orgasms","the real and the fake. And uh I'll tell you right now, as a man, we don't know. We do not know, because to a man sex is like a car accident and determining the female orgasm is like being asked 'What did you see after the car went out of control?'. 'Uh I heard a lot of screeching sounds, uh I remember I was facing the wrong way at one point. And in the end my body was thrown clear."

S05E02,JERRY,"Yeah, that's right!"
S05E02,ELAINE,"Yep.. yep. Um, he's promoting a (pauses) benefit for Goodwill, you know, they, uh, they clothe the (clears her throat) poor, and the homeless.."
S05E02,JERRY,(Points at Elaine) And the indigent.
S05E02,ELAINE,"And the indigent, yeah.. I, I do volunteer work for them. I-I set the whole thing up, and I got Jerry to do it."
S05E02,JERRY,Sure.
S05E02,ELAINE,"Ohh, yeah. Yeah.. yep."
S05E02,JERRY,Uh-huh.

S05E02,JERRY,Yep..
S05E02,ELAINE,Mmm
S05E02,[Setting,A Restaurant]
S05E02,ESTELLE,Maybe you should take a civil service test.
S05E02,GEORGE,(Studying the salt shaker) I'm not taking a civil service test.
S05E02,FRANK,"Look at this, George. (Takes a coin out of his pocket) You ever seen a silver dollar?"
S05E02,GEORGE,"Yes, I've seen a silver dollar."
S05E02,ELAINE,Why don't you want to take a civil service test?
S05E02,GEORGE,To do what?! Work in a post office? Is that what you want me to do?
S05E02,FRANK,"Would you believe when I was 18, I had a ssssilver dollar collection?"
S05E02,ESTELLE,I don't understand. You get job security - you get a pay check every week..
S05E02,GEORGE,I'm a college graduate. You want me to be a mailman?
S05E02,FRANK,"(Still looking at his coin) You know, I couldn't bring myself to spend one of these. I got some kind of a-a-a-a-a phobia."
S05E02,ESTELLE,So what are you gonna do?!
S05E02,GEORGE,I don't know. I do know that I have some kind of a talent - something to offer. I just don't know what it is yet!
S05E02,FRANK,I bet that collection would be worth a lot of money today. (does a form of magic trick making the coin disappear as he shows George an empty hand)
S05E02,GEORGE,(Looks fed up with his parents) Oh my God..
S05E02,FRANK,I don't like this waiter. (Holds up his hand to get the waiters attention - starts snapping) Look at him.. He sees us.. he doesn't want to come over.
S05E02,GEORGE,"(Needing to get away from his parents, he gets up) I need some air.."
S05E02,ESTELLE,"George, where are you going?!"
S05E02,GEORGE,(Walks off) I got a lot of thinking to do.
S05E02,GEORGE,"Oh, I'm sorry. I'm terribly sorry.. (Bends down, and starts picking up her things)"
S05E02,WOMAN,Look at what you've done! You spilled my bag!
S05E02,GEORGE,"(Stuttering) I, I, I, .. here, let me - let me help you.."
S05E02,WOMAN,"No, no ,no. It's all right. (Begins helping him pick her things up)"
S05E02,GEORGE,"It - it's just that I'm here with my parents, and my mother wants me to take a civil service test - and to tell you the truth, I don't even think I'd pass it.. So.."
S05E02,WOMAN,Hmm..
S05E02,GEORGE,What?
S05E02,WOMAN,(Looking at both his hands intensely) Your hands.
S05E02,GEORGE,What about them?
S05E02,WOMAN,They're quite exquisite!
S05E02,GEORGE,They are?
S05E02,WOMAN,(Mesmerized) Extraordinary! Have you ever done any hand modeling?
S05E02,GEORGE,Hand modeling? (Shakes his head 'No')
S05E02,WOMAN,"(Fishes a card out of her purse, then hands it to George) Here's my card. Why don't you, uh, give me a call? (Walks off)"
S05E02,[Setting,Jerry's apartment]
S05E02,JERRY,(Shrugs) I - I don't get it.
S05E02,GEORGE,Me neither!
S05E02,JERRY,What is it?
S05E02,GEORGE,I don't know.
S05E02,JERRY,They're hands!
S05E02,GEORGE,This woman just set me up for a job!
S05E02,JERRY,"(Gets up, and displays his own hands) Well, what about my hands? I don't see how your hands are any better than my hands."
S05E02,GEORGE,"What, are you kidding? (Points at the flaws of Jerry's hands) The knuckles are all out of proportion. you got hair over there - where do you get off comparing your hands to my hands?! This is a one-in-a-million hand. (Points to his own hand)"
S05E02,JERRY,"Well, that's what comes from avoiding manual labor your whole life."
S05E02,GEORGE,"This is it! It happened to me, Jerry! I was sitting in the restaurant, the two nut jobs were talking - I couldn't take it any more. I got up, and (Makes a noise) I bop into this woman.."
S05E02,JERRY,It's just like in the movies.
S05E02,KRAMER,Hey. (He's carrying a suit cover. He hangs it on Jerry's coat hooks)
S05E02,JERRY,Hey.
S05E02,KRAMER,"Hey, George! (Holds out his hand. George shakes it - a hand buzzer goes off. George starts freaking out. Kramer laughs)"
S05E02,GEORGE,"OH!!!! What are you, crazy?! Are you, crazy?!"
S05E02,KRAMER,What?!
S05E02,GEORGE,You coulda damaged my hand!
S05E02,KRAMER,"(Laughing) But, it's only a toy!"
S05E02,JERRY,(Explaining) George has become a hand model.
S05E02,KRAMER,A hand model?
S05E02,JERRY,Yes.
S05E02,KRAMER,(To George) Really? Let me see your hands.
S05E02,GEORGE,"(Defensively) You can look at them, but do NOT touch them. (Holds them out)"
S05E02,KRAMER,"Let's see.. (studies them) oh, those are nice. You know, I've never noticed this before? They're smooth.. creamy.. delicate, yet (Turns to Jerry) masculine."
S05E02,GEORGE,"(Takes two oven mitts from his back pack) Alright, (puts them on) I gotta get going."
S05E02,JERRY,Oven mitts?
S05E02,GEORGE,(Embarrassed) That's all I could find. (A moment passes) Would you mind getting the door?
S05E02,KRAMER,Yeah..
S05E02,JERRY,Alright. (Jerry opens the door for George)
S05E02,GEORGE,Thank you very much. (Walks out)
S05E02,KRAMER,"You're not going to believe what happening with Leslie. You know, ever since you agreed to wear the puffy shirt on the Today show, she's been getting all these orders from boutiques and department stores.."
S05E02,JERRY,"Uh-huh.. (Finally realizes what Kramer said, he looks up) Since I said what?"
S05E02,KRAMER,Agreed to wear the puffy shirt. (Starts unzipping the suit cover)
S05E02,JERRY,What are you talking about?
S05E02,KRAMER,When you said that you'd agree to wear the puffy shirt on the Today show. (Takes the ridiculous puffy shirt out of the cover)
S05E02,JERRY,(Goes up to it) This?
S05E02,KRAMER,Yea.
S05E02,JERRY,I agreed to wear this?!
S05E02,KRAMER,"Yeah, yeah."
S05E02,JERRY,"But, when did I do that?"
S05E02,KRAMER,When we went to dinner the other night.
S05E02,JERRY,"What are you, crazy?!"
S05E02,KRAMER,What were you talking about when I went to the bathroom?
S05E02,JERRY,I don't know! I couldn't understand a word she was saying! I was just nodding!
S05E02,KRAMER,(makes his pop sound) There you go.
S05E02,JERRY,"Where I go? You mean she was asking me to wear this ridiculous shirt on national TV, and I said 'Yes'?!"
S05E02,KRAMER,"Yes, yes! You said it!"
S05E02,JERRY,"But, I - I didn't know what she was talking about. I couldn't hear her!"
S05E02,KRAMER,"(Takes it off the hook, and starts walking toward Jerry with it. He backs defensively backs away from it) Well, she asked you."
S05E02,JERRY,"I - I can't wear this puffy shirt on TV! I mean, look at it! It looks ridiculous!"
S05E02,KRAMER,"Well, you gotta wear it now! All those stores are stocking it based on the condition that you're gonna wear this on the TV show! The factory in New Jersey is already makin' em."
S05E02,JERRY,They're making these?
S05E02,KRAMER,"Yes, yes. This pirate trend that she's come up with, Jerry, this-this is gonna be the new look for the 90's. You're gonna be the first pirate!"
S05E02,JERRY,"(Like a little kid) But, I don't want to be a pirate!"
S05E02,[Setting,The Costanza house]
S05E02,ESTELLE,"I knew it. I knew it.. I always knew you always had beautiful hands. I used to tell people. Frank, didn't I use to talk about his hands?"
S05E02,FRANK,(Looking up from his paper) Who the hell did'ya ever mention his hands to?
S05E02,ESTELLE,(Getting annoyed) I mentioned his hands to plenty of people!
S05E02,FRANK,You never mentioned them to me!
S05E02,GEORGE,"(Snaps, then points to the coffee table) Hand me an Emory board."
S05E02,ESTELLE,I always talk about your hands - how they're so soft and milky white..
S05E02,FRANK,No! You never said milky white!
S05E02,ESTELLE,(Getting angry) I said milky white!
S05E02,GEORGE,(To Estelle) Scissor. (She gets the scissors from the coffee table and hands them to George with the point facing him) Don't hand them to me with the point facing out!
S05E02,ESTELLE,I'm sorry.
S05E02,GEORGE,You're sorry?!
S05E02,ESTELLE,(Apologizing) I'll try to be more careful.
S05E02,GEORGE,"(Stern, angered) I hope so. (Takes the scissors)"
S05E02,ESTELLE,"Georgie.. (Nudges George's arm, disrupting his work with the scissors) Oh, Georgie, would you like some Jell-O?"
S05E02,FRANK,"(To Estelle, referring to the Jell-O) Why'd you put the bananas in there?!"
S05E02,ESTELLE,(Yelling) George likes the bananas!
S05E02,FRANK,(Trying to match her tone) So let him have bananas on the side!
S05E02,GEORGE,"Alright! Please, please! I cannot have this constant bickering!.. Stress is very damaging to the epidermis! Now, I have an important photo session in the morning - my hands have got to be in tip-top shape, so please - keep the television down, and the conversation to a minimum."
S05E02,ESTELLE,(Meek) But Georgie.. what about the Jell-O?
S05E02,GEORGE,(Definite) I'll take it in my room. (Walks off)

S05E02,KRAMER,"Now that's a great looking shirt! (Gets up, admiring the shirt) Aye Captain! (Growls like a pirate) Yeah! I'm glad I ironed it. It's perfect. (Walks around Jerry, inspecting the shirt) Look at it! It's fantastic!"
S05E02,JERRY,"(Resisting) Kramer, how am I gonna wear this?! I-I can't wear this!"

S05E02,KRAMER,Yeah.
S05E02,ELAINE,"Hi, Kramer. Guess what - I just saw Bryant Gumbel, he said he might help out at the benefit!"
S05E02,KRAMER,Great.
S05E02,ELAINE,(Between laughs) What is that?!
S05E02,KRAMER,"It's the puffy shirt. Look at it, eh? Whatd'ya think? Is it cool or what?"
S05E02,ELAINE,(To Jerry) Why're you wearing that now?
S05E02,JERRY,"(Obviously mad at the situation he's in) 'Why am I wearing is now?? I'll tell you why I'm wearing it now - because the lowtalker asked me to, that's why! And I said 'yes'. Do you know why? Because I couldn't HEAR her!"
S05E02,ELAINE,"When did she, (Snickers) when did she ask you this?"
S05E02,JERRY,"When we were at dinner, when Kramer went to the bathroom."
S05E02,ELAINE,I didn't hear anything.
S05E02,JERRY,(Yelling out) Of course not! Nobody hears anything when this woman speaks!
S05E02,ELAINE,"(Just now making the matter serious) Well, you can't wear that on the show."
S05E02,KRAMER,"(To Elaine, muffled, low, and threatening) Elaine, you want to stop?"
S05E02,ELAINE,"(Turning around to Kramer) Wha- What? No. (Back to Jerry) Jerry, you are promoting a benefit to CLOTHE homeless people. You can't come out dressed like that! You're all puffed up!.. You look like the Count of Monte Cristo!"
S05E02,JERRY,"(Arms out, complaining) I have to wear it! The woman has orders for this shirt based on me wearing it on TV.. they're producing them as we speak!"

S05E02,GEORGE,"You mean, uh..?"
S05E02,MAN,Yes. he was not.. master of his domain.
S05E02,GEORGE,(Makes a gesture saying he understands. The man nods) But how.. uh..?
S05E02,MAN,"(Quick, to the point) The muscles.. became so strained with.. overuse, that eventually the hand locked into a deformed position, and he was left with nothing but a claw. (Holds hand up, displaying a claw-like shape) He traveled the world seeking a cure.. acupuncturists.. herbalists.. swamis.. nothing helped. Towards the end, his hands became so frozen the was unable to manipulate utensils, (Visibly disgusted by this last part) and was dependent on Cub Scouts to feed him. I hadn't seen another pair of hands like Ray McKigney's until today. You are his successor. (George looks down at his hands) I uh only hope you have a little more self-control."

S05E03,GEORGE,He just walked away! And once again I'm standing here like a little man. Well not this time! (George leaves the store and follows the dog owner) You! Dog man!
S05E03,ELAINE,My leg looks pretty bad.
S05E03,JERRY,Oh I'm gonna take you over to the emergency room.
S05E03,ELAINE,Okay.
S05E03,JERRY,"(To George) Hey, any luck? Did you catch 'em?"
S05E03,GEORGE,"Uuh, no, no."
S05E03,JERRY,"All right, I'm gonna take Elaine over to the hospital."
S05E03,GEORGE,"(In a really strange way) Good, good, do that."
S05E03,JERRY,What's the matter?
S05E03,GEORGE,"Oh, no, nothing."
S05E03,JERRY,What is it?
S05E03,GEORGE,I can't tell you.
S05E03,ELAINE,"(pulling on Jerry's pants from the ground) Jerry, can we go?"
S05E03,JERRY,"Yeah, yeah, in a second, in a second. (And to George) What do you mean you can't tell me?"
S05E03,GEORGE,"I can't tell you, don't ask."
S05E03,JERRY,I'm asking!
S05E03,ELAINE,"Jerry, my leg."
S05E03,JERRY,"Yeah, yeah, take care of it. (Jerry throws her some toilet paper) Come on, George, what is it?"
S05E03,GEORGE,I saw Amy making out with your cousin Jeffrey.
S05E03,JERRY,What?
S05E03,GEORGE,They were right outside!
S05E03,JERRY,Amy and Jeffrey?
S05E03,GEORGE,Yes!
S05E03,JERRY,Are you sure?
S05E03,GEORGE,"Yes, positive."
S05E03,JERRY,"But you can't see, there's no lenses in those frames."
S05E03,GEORGE,I know! I was squinting.
S05E03,ELAINE,"Okay, listen, Jerry, you just catch up with me okay? You can just follow the trail of blood."
S05E03,JERRY,We're gonna have to talk about this later. (Elaine holds the door open for Jerry while holding her leg) Thank you. Taxi!
S05E03,GEORGE,"(To the store owner) Excuse me, what do you think of these?"
S05E03,DWAYNE,"Oh, we just got those in. It's a very exciting new frame."
S05E03,GEORGE,"Yes, it is exciting! All right, this is gonna be my new face."
S05E03,DWAYNE,"All right, do you have a prescription?"
S05E03,GEORGE,Yeah. (George hands over the prescription) Kramer...
S05E03,DWAYNE,What?
S05E03,GEORGE,Kramer...
S05E03,DWAYNE,What about him?
S05E03,GEORGE,You do know Kramer?
S05E03,DWAYNE,Yes...
S05E03,GEORGE,"Well, I'm mentioning his name."
S05E03,DWAYNE,Why?
S05E03,GEORGE,Because... you know...
S05E03,DWAYNE,"No, I don't know. Look, I'm gonna need a deposit on these."
S05E03,ELAINE,"Oh, come on. Cousin Jeffrey? It's not possible!"
S05E03,JERRY,"Why not? They could have met. She loves the park, he works for the Parks Department."
S05E03,ELAINE,"Jerry, that is so ridiculous. But, George didn't even have his glasses on!"
S05E03,JERRY,But he was squinting.
S05E03,ELAINE,So what? Squinting doesn't make that much of a difference.
S05E03,JERRY,"Are you kidding? I've seen 'em squint. He can squint his way down to like twenty, thirty vision. Once we were driving down from the Catskills and he lost his glasses. He squinted his way from Wortsborough down to the Tappan Zee Bridge! He was spotting raccoons, on the road!"
S05E03,DOCTER,Okay.
S05E03,ELAINE,Okay? That's it? I don't need a shot?
S05E03,DOCTER,"Not shot, dog bite."
S05E03,ELAINE,"No, no, no. I know I wasn't shot. Do I need a shot?"
S05E03,DOCTER,"Not shot, dog bite. Woof woof, not bang bang."
S05E03,JERRY,"Nah, look at this. Cable's out."
S05E03,AMY,"Oh that's okay, we don't have to watch tv."
S05E03,JERRY,"No, no, no. No trouble at all, it's a principal the thing. (Jerry picks up the phone and dials the number) I like them to know that I know what's going on. That they're not... getting away with anything. Oh, I'm on hold. So, what did you do yesterday?"
S05E03,AMY,Yesterday?
S05E03,JERRY,"Yeah, you remember yesterday? Beautiful day... good day to be... out."
S05E03,AMY,I didn't do anything.
S05E03,JERRY,(laughing) Oh you must have done something.
S05E03,AMY,"No, nothing really."
S05E03,JERRY,Didn't go out of the house? Didn't take a walk... on Columbus Avenue?
S05E03,AMY,"Well, I did go out for a little while."
S05E03,JERRY,"Well, your day's getting more interesting already. (Jerry shows the phone) Ah, see, told me they'd be back in a minute and THEY lied."
S05E03,AMY,You can't thrust anyone.
S05E03,JERRY,"No you can't. (hangs up the phone) Now let's cut the ball, sister! You think I don't know about you swapping spit with somebody yesterday on Columbus Avenue?"
S05E03,AMY,What are you talking about?
S05E03,JERRY,"Look, my friend saw you."
S05E03,AMY,Saw me? With who?
S05E03,JERRY,You tell me.
S05E03,AMY,There's nothing to tell.
S05E03,JERRY,There isn't?
S05E03,AMY,No.
S05E03,JERRY,Oh... all right... wanna get some pizza?
S05E03,AMY,I had a feeling this was to good to be true.
S05E03,JERRY,Why?
S05E03,AMY,I knew there had to be another side to you.
S05E03,JERRY,"No, no, there's no side!"
S05E03,AMY,"There is a side, an ugly side."
S05E03,JERRY,"No, no, no ugly side."
S05E03,AMY,"Look, I think I'm gonna go."
S05E03,JERRY,Why?
S05E03,AMY,It's really hot in here.
S05E03,JERRY,"Uuh, so we can still go out on Friday though?"
S05E03,AMY,Yeah. When you getting an air conditioner?
S05E03,JERRY,It's coming! It's a Commando 8! 12.000 BTU's! It's gonna be like a meat locker in here.
S05E03,JERRY,I was an idiot for listening to you!
S05E03,GEORGE,"Hey, I saw what I saw."
S05E03,JERRY,"Ooh, everything was going so well. She hadn't seen any flaws in me. Now she sees a side."
S05E03,GEORGE,What side?
S05E03,JERRY,"A bad side, an ugly side."
S05E03,GEORGE,"Ooh, so what?"
S05E03,JERRY,So what? I wasn't planning on showing that side for another six months. Now you make me throw off the whole learning curve.
S05E03,GEORGE,Why don't you just ask Jeffrey?
S05E03,JERRY,"Ah, he'd just deny it."
S05E03,GEORGE,There must be some way to find out.
S05E03,JERRY,Amy said nothing happened.
S05E03,GEORGE,"What, you're gonna take her word over mine? I'm your best friend!"
S05E03,JERRY,"Yeah, but you're blind as a bat!"
S05E03,GEORGE,I was squinting! Remember that drive from Wortsborough? (snapping his fingers) I was spotting those raccoons.
S05E03,JERRY,"They were mailboxes, you idiot. I didn't have the heart to tell you."
S05E03,GEORGE,"(noticing something) Hey look, a dime."
S05E03,GEORGE,"Heh, Mercury head. You mind?"
S05E03,JERRY,"(Stunned) No, keep it. (Elaine enters the apartment) Hey what happened to you? You buzzed five minutes ago."
S05E03,ELAINE,There was a dog in front of the building and it spooked me. I couldn't come in until he left.
S05E03,JERRY,A little white dog?
S05E03,ELAINE,Yeah.
S05E03,JERRY,Snowball? You were afraid of Snowball?
S05E03,ELAINE,I'm afraid of dogs now.
S05E03,JERRY,He's like a squirrel.
S05E03,ELAINE,Well he frightened me.
S05E03,GEORGE,Did you get the shot?
S05E03,ELAINE,No. He said I didn't need a shot.
S05E03,GEORGE,You got bit by a strange dog and you didn't get a rabies shot?
S05E03,ELAINE,"What, you think I should have?"
S05E03,JERRY,"You know, you should just go back to the optical store and ask Dwayne if he knows the name of the owner of the dog."
S05E03,ELAINE,"All right, that's a good idea. I'm gonna do that."
S05E03,KRAMER,The AC is on it's way.
S05E03,GEORGE,"Pardon me, I went to see your friend Dwayne... there was no discount."
S05E03,KRAMER,What?
S05E03,GEORGE,"That's right, no discount!"
S05E03,KRAMER,Well did you mention my name?
S05E03,GEORGE,"Yes, I mentioned your name."
S05E03,KRAMER,And?
S05E03,GEORGE,"Pbbbs, Bubkis!"
S05E03,KRAMER,"Now I don't believe this. That guy owes me big time. I got him off sugar! Look, I'm gonna go down there with you right now."
S05E03,GEORGE,"All right, let me just... I'm gonna grap an apple."
S05E03,JERRY,"Hey, Kramer, Elaine's afraid of Snowball!"
S05E03,KRAMER,Little Snowball? He runs on batteries!
S05E03,ELAINE,"You know, George, that's an onion."
S05E03,GEORGE,Yes it is.
S05E03,ELAINE,He couldn't tell an apple from an union and he's your eye witness?
S05E03,GEORGE,"I saw them making out, you can believe it."
S05E03,JERRY,"I don't know what to believe! You're eating unions, you're spotting dimes, I don't know what the hell is going on."
S05E03,KRAMER,"Look, all you gotta to do, is get Amy and Jeffrey together somewhere, that's it."
S05E03,JERRY,"Hey wait a second, wait a second. I'm going over to Jeffrey's apartment tomorrow night to pick up these Paul Simon tickets. I'm gonna surprise Amy. All I gotta do is bring her with me. And then when Jeffrey opens the door, it's Howdy Doody time."
S05E03,KRAMER,"Right this way, mister Doody!"
S05E03,GEORGE,(crying from the onion) You'll see I'm right.
S05E03,KRAMER,"Hey, Dwayny."
S05E03,DWAYNE,Oh hello Kramer.
S05E03,KRAMER,What is going on here?
S05E03,DWAYNE,What are you talking about?
S05E03,KRAMER,I'm talking about the thirty percent discount.
S05E03,ELAINE,Uhm excuse me... uh... a man came in here...
S05E03,GEORGE,"Elaine, don't interrupt, they're discounting something."
S05E03,DWAYNE,Who said anything about a discount.
S05E03,KRAMER,"Ooh, how quickly we forget. You owe me buddy."
S05E03,DWAYNE,For what?
S05E03,KRAMER,Remember this?
S05E03,DWAYNE,What are you doing?
S05E03,KRAMER,Six months ago you were eating four of those for breakfast and chasing it with a ring ding. And two butter fingers on the train. Sounds familiar?
S05E03,DWAYNE,Put that away!
S05E03,KRAMER,"Remember that night I found you at Dinky Donuts? You were all *hopped* up on cinnamon swirls! They wouldn't serve you anymore! You wouldn't even have any teeth if it wasn't for me taking you over to Joe's fruit stand and stuffin' cantaloupe down your throat! So much for gratitude... yeah, yeah, yeah!"
S05E03,DWAYNE,"All right, all right, all right! I'll give him the discount, just put that thing away! This squares us."
S05E03,ELAINE,Can I just have the name...
S05E03,DWAYNE,Out!
S05E03,KRAMER,We'll see you Dwayne.
S05E03,JERRY,"I don't know what to tell you, Elton."
S05E03,ELAINE,"(While reading a book) Oh oh, listen to this, this is not good, listen to these symptoms for rabies anxiety, irritability. I got those, I'm irritable!"
S05E03,JERRY,(To George) Who picked these out?
S05E03,GEORGE,I did!
S05E03,JERRY,They're ladies' glasses! You know all you need is that little chain around your neck so you can wear 'em while you're playing Canasta.
S05E03,GEORGE,Well Elaine was supposed to help me.
S05E03,ELAINE,Hey! I got bit by a dog! I had to go to the hospital! I was bleeding to death! I can't solve every little problem you have!
S05E03,JERRY,"Hey, hey."
S05E03,ELAINE,I'm sorry... sorry.
S05E03,KRAMER,Commando 8 has arrived!
S05E03,JERRY,Take it to the window.
S05E03,KRAMER,12.000 BTU's of raw cooling power. (Kramer places the air conditioner in the window) Installed!
S05E03,GEORGE,That's it? You don't have to screw it in or anything?
S05E03,KRAMER,"No, just plug it in and the Commando 8 does the rest. (And to Jerry) I'll seal that up later, right?"
S05E03,JERRY,Just in time for Amy.
S05E03,GEORGE,"Oh yeah, when are you gonna execute that plan?"
S05E03,ELAINE,"I've got such a headache. Oh, that's another symptom!"
S05E03,KRAMER,Of what?
S05E03,JERRY,Rabies.
S05E03,KRAMER,"Oh that's fatal, you don't want that!"
S05E03,ELAINE,"I know I don't want it! I don't need you to tell me what I don't want, you stupid hipster dufus!"
S05E03,JERRY,"Hey, hey, what is this? What's going on here?"
S05E03,ELAINE,"I'm sorry, Kramer, I'm sorry."
S05E03,KRAMER,"No, no, it's all right. I had a friend who had rabies once. (George's eating chips) May I have one of those, madam?"
S05E03,GEORGE,Madam? What are you calling me madam for?
S05E03,KRAMER,They're ladies' glasses.
S05E03,KRAMER,"Now look here, see it's right here Gloria Vanderbilt Collection."
S05E03,GEORGE,He sold me ladies' glasses!
S05E03,ELAINE,I... I think I'm... I'm having trouble swallowing. I can't... I can't swallow.
S05E03,KRAMER,"She's got rabies, just like my friend Bob Sacamano. She's delirious. (Elaine drinks some water and drools) She's foaming at the mouth!"
S05E03,ELAINE,Is this gonna hurt?
S05E03,DOCTER,"Yes, very much."
S05E03,ELAINE,What if Jeffrey's not home. Did you ever think of that?
S05E03,JERRY,"Oh he'll be home, it's Friday night. That's the big night on the Nature Channel."
S05E03,ELAINE,Let me tell you this there is no way cousin Jeffrey is dating Amy. He looks like a horse!
S05E03,JERRY,He does look like a horse.
S05E03,ELAINE,"Yeah, he's got a real horse face. (Elaine, while looking out the window) Here, look at this! It's the guy with the dog! (She opens the window and screams) Hey! Hey! You down there! Remember me? I had to get shot because of your stupid dog!"
S05E03,DOG OWNER,Hey who are you calling stupid?
S05E03,JERRY,"Hey, shall we spit on him?"
S05E03,ELAINE,"No no no no, come on, let's go downstairs."
S05E03,KRAMER,"(Singing) Oh myyyy papayaaaa. (The air conditioner wobbles) The air conditioner! (Kramer tries to keep it from falling by holding it's cord, but it snaps) I think it got the dog!"
S05E03,GEORGE,"Ah, Oh boy."
S05E03,BLIND MAN,"Excuse me, uh I'm new here, would you mind walking me back to my locker?"
S05E03,GEORGE,"Oh uuh, sure, why not. (the blind man hangs on to George's arm) Hey, that's the guy."
S05E03,BLIND MAN,What guy?
S05E03,GEORGE,"The guy that stole my glasses. This time I got 'em! (George follows the man onto the street, dragging the blind man with him) Would you pick it up a little?"
S05E03,BLIND MAN,Where the hell are we going?
S05E03,GEORGE,"He's getting on a bus, damn! (To the blind man) Those are nice glasses."
S05E03,BLIND MAN,"I don't like 'em, they pinch my nose."
S05E03,GEORGE,Is that right?
S05E03,GEORGE,"Dwayne, my friend and I would like to exchange frames. Could you put his lenses in my frames and mine in his?"
S05E03,DWAYNE,"(While eating a candy bar) Yeah, we can do that."
S05E03,GEORGE,And I'd like a discount.
S05E03,DWAYNE,Why should I give you a discount.
S05E03,GEORGE,"Listen, you're lucking I'm not asking for a whole refund. (trying to speak quietly) You gave me ladies' frames!"
S05E03,BLIND MAN,What's that about ladies' frames?
S05E03,DOG OWNER,"I'm trying to track down that lady that was in here the other day, the one that was messing with my dog."
S05E03,GEORGE,"Yeah, well, she's trying to track you down."
S05E03,DOG OWNER,"Well I would love to talk with her. (George chuckles) She lives on 81st Street, right?"
S05E03,GEORGE,"No, that's Jerry."
S05E03,DOG OWNER,"Really? You wouldn't happen to know what apartment he's in, would you?"
S05E03,GEORGE,"Yeah, 5A!"
S05E03,DOG OWNER,Thanks a lot!
S05E03,AMY,So what are we doing here?
S05E03,JERRY,"Oh, you'll find out."
S05E03,AMY,"I don't know, you're acting very mysteriously."
S05E03,JERRY,"Well, I'm very mysterious by nature. (Jerry knocks on the door) A lot of women find that attractive."
S05E03,AMY,I find it annoying.
S05E03,JERRY,Oh?
S05E03,UNCLE LEO,Helloooo!
S05E03,JERRY,Uncle Leo?!
S05E03,UNCLE LEO,Come on in.
S05E03,JERRY,This is Amy.
S05E03,UNCLE LEO,Hello Amy.
S05E03,JERRY,"Unlce Leo, what are you doing here?"
S05E03,UNCLE LEO,Jeffrey went out tonight.
S05E03,JERRY,Ooh! Very convenient.
S05E03,UNCLE LEO,"I'm supposed to tape this nature show for him, he loves nature. Botany, zoology. You know his botany teacher from college stays in close touch with him? They became friends!"
S05E03,JERRY,Oh really?
S05E03,UNCLE LEO,"That's pretty rare! I mean, actual friends! Like equals! They have dinner together, they have discussions..."
S05E03,JERRY,Uncle Leo! Did he leave any tickets here for me?
S05E03,UNCLE LEO,"Oh yeah yeah, I'll get 'em."
S05E03,JERRY,Thank you.
S05E03,AMY,What tickets?
S05E03,JERRY,To the Paul Simon concert in the park!
S05E03,AMY,We're going to the Paul Simon concert?
S05E03,JERRY,"That's right, lady!"
S05E03,AMY,Oh what a great surprise!
S05E03,JERRY,I thought you'd like that.
S05E03,AMY,"Oooh, so that's why you've been acting so mysteriously."
S05E03,JERRY,"Now you know. That, and that alone, is the reason."
S05E03,UNCLE LEO,You know Jeffrey's favorite animal the leopard.
S05E03,AMY,Why is that?
S05E03,UNCLE LEO,"He likes the spots. Oh uh, here's the tickets."
S05E03,JERRY,Thank you.
S05E03,UNCLE LEO,"Oh uh, he asked me to give you a message. He said that uh he's very sorry and uh he hopes you'll forgive 'em."
S05E03,JERRY,(To Amy) Aha! So it's true! You were making out with him!
S05E03,AMY,"What are you talking about, I don't know Jeffrey. Oh so this is why you brought me up here?"
S05E03,JERRY,"Oh very convincing, but it's not gonna work this time."
S05E03,UNCLE LEO,What are you talking about? All he meant was that he was sorry that the seats aren't very good.
S05E03,JERRY,Oh... oh... wanna get some pizza?
S05E03,GEORGE,"Boy, these really do pinch the nose."
S05E03,BLIND MAN,Tough luck! A deal's a deal.
S05E03,GEORGE,Oh my God it is them.
S05E03,JERRY,I still don't know how you spotted that dime. I think you planted it. Plus I had to pay that vet bill for the stupid dog. I don't know how that guy got my name.
S05E03,GEORGE,"Yeah. Hmm. Boy these really do pinch. I tell you, if I ever find the son of a bitch that stole my glasses..."
S05E04,JERRY,"So, does he like you?"
S05E04,ELAINE,What do you think?
S05E04,JERRY,You like him?
S05E04,ELAINE,"Yeah, yeah like him, definitely like him. I like him a lot."
S05E04,GEORGE,"So, what's wrong with him?"
S05E04,ELAINE,"Nothing, and I've looked."
S05E04,GEORGE,"Well, I'm sure you'll find something."
S05E04,JERRY,"So, how did you meet him?"
S05E04,ELAINE,In the office.
S05E04,JERRY,"So, he's a writer."
S05E04,ELAINE,Yeah.
S05E04,JERRY,"Yeah, big surprise."
S05E04,ELAINE,"So, I was sitting at the reception desk, I was looking pretty hot. I was wearing my sling back pumps."
S05E04,GEORGE,What are those?
S05E04,ELAINE,"Ask your mother, (making fun of George's living situation) you live with her now, don't you? Anyway, so then this guy comes up to me and starts feeling my jacket through his thumb and his forefinger like this."
S05E04,JERRY,"So, what did you do?"
S05E04,ELAINE,"I said ""So, what do you think?"". And he said, ""Gabardine?"". And I said, ""Yeah."" That was it."
S05E04,GEORGE,"Wow, just felt your material?"
S05E04,ELAINE,Yeah...Jake Jarmel.
S05E04,GEORGE,Sounds like a cool guy.
S05E04,JERRY,"Sounds like a jerk. Felt your material, come on."
S05E04,GEORGE,"Jerry, where did you get that sweater?"
S05E04,JERRY,"Oh, what do you think? I found it at the back of my closet."
S05E04,GEORGE,I think that's what the back of closets are for.
S05E04,ELAINE,"Hey, that's Barry. Look it's Barry. (taps on the window)"
S05E04,JERRY,(taps on the window) Hey...
S05E04,ELAINE,Hi.
S05E04,GEORGE,Who's that?
S05E04,JERRY,"That's Barry Prophet, he's our accountant."
S05E04,GEORGE,I don't know how you can let this guy handle all your money.
S05E04,ELAINE,"Oh, he doesn't handle my money, he handles Jerry's money. He just does my taxes."
S05E04,JERRY,"Hey Barry, how you doing?"
S05E04,BARRY,"Hey, how are you?"
S05E04,JERRY,This is my friend George.
S05E04,BARRY,Hi George. (shakes George's hand)
S05E04,ELAINE,"Hi, what are you doing on this neighborhood?"
S05E04,BARRY,"Nothing really. (sniffs; looks around) You, eh, you eat here?"
S05E04,JERRY,"Yeah, so how's my money?"
S05E04,BARRY,Well it's still green. (sniffs twice)
S05E04,JERRY,"What, you got a cold?"
S05E04,BARRY,"No, no."
S05E04,ELAINE,"Wow, look at that ring."
S05E04,BARRY,"(showing off the ring to Elaine) Oh, uh you like that? (Elaine not amused gives Barry a polite laugh; Barry sniffs) Say uh, where's the bathroom?"
S05E04,JERRY,"Bathroom uh, bathroom's uh right over there."
S05E04,BARRY,"(turns looking in the direction Jerry mentioned) Oh, great."
S05E04,JERRY,Did you see that?
S05E04,ELAINE,See what?
S05E04,GEORGE,"Yes, I saw that."
S05E04,ELAINE,What?
S05E04,JERRY,What was all that sniffing?
S05E04,ELAINE,I don't know.
S05E04,JERRY,You don't think...?
S05E04,ELAINE,"Oh, no! Come on Jerry."
S05E04,GEORGE,He was definitely sniffing.
S05E04,JERRY,"I mean what if, what if, this this guy has got all my money. Plus he has got some Kramer's money with him. This guy could write checks to himself right out of my account."
S05E04,ELAINE,"No, I have known this guy since college. He doesn't do drugs."
S05E04,JERRY,"Then, what was all that sniffing?"
S05E04,ELAINE,Maybe it's the cold weather.
S05E04,JERRY,Today's not cold.
S05E04,GEORGE,"All right, I gotta get going. My parents are expecting me."
S05E04,ELAINE,(making fun of George as he leaves) Don't forget to wash your hands before supper.
S05E04,FRANK,Why do you need all that ketchup for?
S05E04,GEORGE,This is my ketchup. I bought this ketchup just so I could have as much as I want.
S05E04,FRANK,"So I, I talked to Phil Casacof today."
S05E04,ESTELLE,Phil Casacof?
S05E04,FRANK,"Yeah, you know my friend, the bra salesman. He says they are looking maybe to put somebody on so I got you an interview next Friday with his boss."
S05E04,GEORGE,"Next Friday, what time?"
S05E04,FRANK,2 o'clock.
S05E04,GEORGE,That's my whole afternoon! I was going to look for sneakers.
S05E04,FRANK,You can look for sneakers the next day!
S05E04,ESTELLE,He doesn't know anything about bras.
S05E04,GEORGE,"I know a little. Besides, what do you have to know?"
S05E04,FRANK,"Well, it wouldn't hurt to go in the and be able to discuss it intelligently. Maybe you should take a look at a few bras? (to Estelle) Where is you bra? Give him a bra to look."
S05E04,ESTELLE,I am not giving him a bra.
S05E04,FRANK,Why not?
S05E04,ESTELLE,Because I don't need him looking at my bra.
S05E04,FRANK,"Why, so he'll go to the interview and he wouldn't know what he's talking about!?!"
S05E04,GEORGE,Do we have to...?
S05E04,FRANK,You don't even know what they're made from.
S05E04,GEORGE,They are made from lycra-spandex.
S05E04,FRANK,Get out of here! Lycra-spandex?
S05E04,ESTELLE,I think they are made from lycra-spandex.
S05E04,FRANK,Wanna bet? How much you wanna bet?
S05E04,ESTELLE,I'm not betting!
S05E04,FRANK,Take a look.
S05E04,ESTELLE,"All right, I'll get a bra."
S05E04,FRANK,(Yelling to Estelle as she leaves)I don't know what the big problem is getting a bra?!
S05E04,GEORGE,She doesn't want to get a bra.
S05E04,FRANK,"I'm not saying go to the library and read the whole history, but it wouldn't kill you to know a little bit about it."
S05E04,GEORGE,"All right, it wouldn't kill me."
S05E04,FRANK,"How long it takes to find a bra? What's going on in there? You ask me to get a pair of underwear, I'm back in two seconds...you know about the uh cup sizes and all? They have different cups."
S05E04,GEORGE,Yea I-I know about the cups.
S05E04,FRANK,"You got the A, the B, the C and the D. That's the biggest."
S05E04,GEORGE,I know the D is the biggest. I've based my whole life on knowing that the D is the biggest.
S05E04,ESTELLE,"Here, here's the bra."
S05E04,FRANK,Let me see it.
S05E04,ESTELLE,(reading the bra) 100% lycra-spandex.
S05E04,FRANK,Let me see it.
S05E04,ESTELLE,"I told you. Here, think you know everything?"
S05E04,FRANK,"Hmm, that's surprising. All right, what else? You got the cups in the front, two loops in the back. All right, a guess that's about it."
S05E04,GEORGE,"I got it. Cups in the front, loops in the back. (puts the bra on the table)"
S05E04,ESTELLE,You got ketchup on it!
S05E04,KRAMER,"Sniffing, what do you mean sniffing?"
S05E04,JERRY,"Sniffing, with his nose."
S05E04,KRAMER,"Jerry, he probably had a cold."
S05E04,JERRY,"No, I asked him."
S05E04,KRAMER,"So, what are you saying?"
S05E04,JERRY,"I don't know, you know, what if...?"
S05E04,KRAMER,Drugs? You think he's on drugs?
S05E04,JERRY,I don't know.
S05E04,KRAMER,Jerry
S05E04,JERRY,All I know he was sniffing.
S05E04,KRAMER,"Listen, we went in on a CD together."
S05E04,JERRY,I know.
S05E04,KRAMER,"And Newman gave you money too. So, I didn't even meet this guy. You know, we trusted you."
S05E04,JERRY,"Look, it doesn't necessarily mean anything yet, it just means he was sniffing."
S05E04,KRAMER,"Well, what else? Was he nervous? Did he use a lot of slang? Did he use the word 'man'?"
S05E04,JERRY,"No, he didn't use 'man'."
S05E04,KRAMER,"I mean when he was leaving did he say ""I'm splittin'""?"
S05E04,JERRY,"No, but in one point he did use the bathroom."
S05E04,KRAMER,Whoh!
S05E04,JERRY,Do you think that's a bad sign?
S05E04,KRAMER,"Yes!! Yes, that's what they do! They live in the bathroom! All right, what are we going to do? We are going to get our money back, right?"
S05E04,JERRY,I don't know. (takes off his sweater) This sweater really itches me. You want it?
S05E04,KRAMER,(grabbing the sweater) Yeah.
S05E04,ELAINE,"Hello.... hello, oh..."
S05E04,JAKE,"Well, you notice anything?"
S05E04,ELAINE,"You have cleaned out the whole apartment and you're making dinner. You're perfect, you're a perfect man."
S05E04,JAKE,Ooh...
S05E04,ELAINE,Did anyone call?
S05E04,JAKE,"You got a few messages, I wrote them down."
S05E04,ELAINE,Where are they?
S05E04,JAKE,"Lets see, they are (looking for the paper; finds it; hands it to Elaine) here they are."
S05E04,ELAINE,"Thank you. (looking at the messages) Oh ya, heh, I'll call you back. Ooh, Myra had the baby! Oh, my God that's wonderful! Who called?"
S05E04,JAKE,She did.
S05E04,ELAINE,"She did? Oh, that's so great!"
S05E04,JAKE,Where do you keep the corkscrew?
S05E04,ELAINE,In the drawer on the right. Hmm...
S05E04,JAKE,What?
S05E04,ELAINE,Nah it's nothing.
S05E04,JAKE,What is it?
S05E04,ELAINE,It's nothing.
S05E04,JAKE,Tell me.
S05E04,ELAINE,"Well, I was just curious why you didn't use an exclamation point?"
S05E04,JAKE,What are you talking about?
S05E04,ELAINE,"See, right here you wrote ""Myra had the baby"", but you didn't use an exclamation point."
S05E04,JAKE,So?
S05E04,ELAINE,"So, it's ya nothing. Forget it, forget it, I just find it curious."
S05E04,JAKE,What's so curious about it?
S05E04,ELAINE,"Well, I mean if one of your close friends had a baby and I left you a message about it, I would use an exclamation point."
S05E04,JAKE,"Well, maybe I don't use my exclamation points as haphazardly as you do."
S05E04,ELAINE,You don't think that someone having a baby warrants an exclamation point.
S05E04,JAKE,"Hey look, I just chalked down the message. I didn't know I was required to capture the mood of each caller."
S05E04,ELAINE,I just thought you would be a little more excited about a friend of mine having a baby.
S05E04,JAKE,"Ok, I'm excited. I just don't happen to like exclamation points."
S05E04,ELAINE,"Well, you know Jake, you should learn to use them. Like the way I'm talking right now, I would put an exclamation points at the end of all these sentences! On this one! And on that one!"
S05E04,JAKE,"Well, you can put one on this one I'm leaving!"
S05E04,JERRY,You're out of your mind you know that.
S05E04,ELAINE,Why?
S05E04,JERRY,It's an exclamation point! It's a line with a dot under it.
S05E04,ELAINE,"Well, I felt a call for one."
S05E04,JERRY,"A call for one, you know I thought I've heard everything. I've never heard a relationship being affected by a punctuation."
S05E04,ELAINE,I found it very troubling that he didn't use one.
S05E04,JERRY,George was right. Didn't take you long.
S05E04,KRAMER,Anything new with that guy on drugs?
S05E04,ELAINE,"Oh, he's not on drugs."
S05E04,KRAMER,"Then why the sniffing? Who walks around (sniff, sniff) sniffing?"
S05E04,ELAINE,"All right, here, you call him right now. See if he's sniffing right now."
S05E04,JERRY,Good idea. (Jerry calls Barry's office)
S05E04,VOICE ON THE PHONE,Prophet and Goldstein.
S05E04,JERRY,"Yes, I'd like to speak to Barry Prophet, please."
S05E04,VOICE,I'm sorry he's out of town this week.
S05E04,JERRY,Out of town?
S05E04,VOICE,"Yes, he went to South America."
S05E04,JERRY,South America?
S05E04,KRAMER,South America?
S05E04,JERRY,"I'll call back, thank you. (hangs up the phone) He went to South America!"
S05E04,KRAMER,Yyyeeaaah!!
S05E04,ELAINE,So what?
S05E04,JERRY,Who goes to South America?
S05E04,ELAINE,People go to South America.
S05E04,JERRY,"Yeah, and they come back with things taped to they're large intestine."
S05E04,ELAINE,"So, because of a few bad apples you're gonna impugn an entire continent?"
S05E04,JERRY,"Yes, I'm impugning a continent."
S05E04,KRAMER,"Well, I say we're going to take our money right now!"
S05E04,NEWMAN,"Hey, hey..."
S05E04,JERRY,Hello Newman.
S05E04,NEWMAN,"Hello Jerry. (to Kramer) So, any news?"
S05E04,KRAMER,"Yeah, he skipped out and *ptruut* went to South America!"
S05E04,NEWMAN,South America?! (to Jerry) What kind of snow blower you get us mixed up with?
S05E04,ELAINE,"Look it, gentlemen. The fact remains you still have no proof. This is all speculation and hearsay."
S05E04,KRAMER,"Wait, there is one way to find out. We set up a sting. You know like Abscam. Like Abscam Jerry."
S05E04,ELAINE,"Ohh, what are you gonna do? You gonna put on phony beards and dress-up like Arab sheiks and sit around in some hotel room. I mean come on..."
S05E04,JERRY,Wait a second. Maybe there is someway we can tempt him and find out...
S05E04,NEWMAN,If we put our three heads together we should come up with something.
S05E04,KRAMER,What's today?
S05E04,NEWMAN,It's Thursday.
S05E04,KRAMER,Really? Feels like Tuesday.
S05E04,NEWMAN,"Tuesday has no feel. Monday has a feel, Friday has a feel, Sunday has a feel...."
S05E04,KRAMER,I feel Tuesday and Wednesday...
S05E04,JERRY,"All right, shut up the both of you! You're making me nervous. Where is he already? He should've been out of work by now."
S05E04,NEWMAN,"Hey, you know this is kind of fun."
S05E04,KRAMER,"Yeah, maybe we oughta become private detectives..."
S05E04,JERRY,Yeah maybe you should.
S05E04,KRAMER,Maybe I will.
S05E04,NEWMAN,"Yeah, me too."
S05E04,JERRY,"All right, what are you gonna say to him?"
S05E04,KRAMER,Just gonna find out if he's interested.
S05E04,NEWMAN,"Hey, hey maybe I should go with him?"
S05E04,JERRY,"No, you stay here in the car."
S05E04,NEWMAN,Who made you the leader?
S05E04,JERRY,"All right Newman, one more peep outta you, you're out of the whole operation!"
S05E04,NEWMAN,Alright.
S05E04,JERRY,There he is. He's going into that bar.
S05E04,KRAMER,"All right, I'm going in."
S05E04,JERRY,Be careful Kramer.
S05E04,NEWMAN,I shoulda gone in with him.
S05E04,JERRY,"No, you stay here in the car. I may need you."
S05E04,NEWMAN,What you need me in the car for?
S05E04,JERRY,I might need you to get me a soda.
S05E04,KRAMER,"I'll have a brewsky, Charlie."
S05E04,BARTENDER,The name's Mitch.
S05E04,KRAMER,"Oh, there's nothing like a cold one after a long day, eh?"
S05E04,BARRY,Yeah.
S05E04,KRAMER,"Oh yeah, I've been known to drink a beer or two. But then again, I've been known to do a lot of things. (Waiter opens the counter which hits Kramer on the head) Cigarette?"
S05E04,BARRY,"(sniffs) No, I never touch them."
S05E04,KRAMER,"I suck'em down like Coca-Cola. Well here's to feeling good all the time. (Kramer drinks the beer and smokes the cigarette at the same time. Barry sniffs) Looks like you've got yourself a little cold there, eh fella?"
S05E04,BARRY,I don't think so.
S05E04,KRAMER,Me neither.
S05E04,JERRY,"You should try this new dental floss Glide, it's fantastic."
S05E04,NEWMAN,I use dental tape.
S05E04,JERRY,You should try this.
S05E04,NEWMAN,I don't wanna.
S05E04,JERRY,Not even once?
S05E04,NEWMAN,No.
S05E04,JERRY,You're an idiot.
S05E04,NEWMAN,"Why, because I use dental tape?"
S05E04,JERRY,"Right, anyone who uses dental tape is an idiot."
S05E04,KRAMER,South America?
S05E04,BARRY,"Yeah, yeah."
S05E04,KRAMER,Well that's a burgeoning continent.
S05E04,BARRY,"Well, they are expanding their economic base."
S05E04,KRAMER,Tell me about it.
S05E04,BARRY,"(sniffs) Excuse me, I gotta goto the bathroom."
S05E04,KRAMER,I'm hip.
S05E04,BARRY,Hip to the what?
S05E04,KRAMER,To the whole scene. (sniff)
S05E04,BARRY,What scene?
S05E04,KRAMER,The bathroom scene. (moves his knows as you would if you sniffed)
S05E04,BARRY,"Listen, don't take this personally, but when I'm coming back I'm sitting over there."
S05E04,KRAMER,What ever turns you on.
S05E04,NEWMAN,"No, no I don't like it."
S05E04,JERRY,What do you mean you don't like it? How could you not like it?
S05E04,NEWMAN,I like the thick tape.
S05E04,BARRY,Heeyy!! What kind of a nut are you?
S05E04,FARKUS,"So, basically George the job here is quite simple. Selling bras."
S05E04,GEORGE,"Well, that interests me very much Mr. Farkus.Very much indeed, sir."
S05E04,FARKUS,Have you ever sold a woman's line before?
S05E04,GEORGE,"No, but um I have very good report with women, very good, comfortable. And from the first time I laid eyes on a brassieres, I was enthralled."
S05E04,FARKUS,Hum. tell me about it.
S05E04,GEORGE,"Well, I was 14 years old. I was in my friends bathroom. His mother's brassieres were hanging on the shower rod and I picked it up, studied it. I thought, I like this. I didn't know what way or what level, but I knew I wanted to be around brassieres."
S05E04,FARKUS,That's an incredible story. You have a remarkable passion for brassieres.
S05E04,GEORGE,"Well, they're more than an underwear to me Mr. Farkus. Two cups in the front, two loops in the back. How do they do it?"
S05E04,FARKUS,"Well, I think I can say, barring some unforeseen incident, that you will have a very bright future here at E.D. Granmont."
S05E04,GEORGE,"Thank you Mr.Farkus, thank you very much indeed sir."
S05E04,FARKUS,See you monday 9 o'clock.
S05E04,GEORGE,"If you don't mind, sir. I'll be here at 8."
S05E04,FARKUS,Excellent.
S05E04,GEORGE,"So long, Mr. Farkus."
S05E04,MS. DE GRANMONT,What you're think you're doing?
S05E04,GEORGE,"Oh, nothing..."
S05E04,MS. DE GRANMONT,"Farkus, get out here!"
S05E04,FARKUS,"Yes, Ms. De Granmont?"
S05E04,MS. DE GRANMONT,"Farkus, who is this pervert little weasel?"
S05E04,FARKUS,"Uh, this is Costanza, he's our new bra salesman. (George's offers his hand to shake) He's supposed to start on monday."
S05E04,MS. DE GRANMONT,"If he's here on monday, you're not. Take a pick."
S05E04,FARKUS,(to George) Get out! (to Ms. De Granmont) I'm terribly sorry Ms. De Granmont...
S05E04,ELAINE,"You wanted to see me, Mr. Lippman?"
S05E04,LIPPMAN,I was just uh going over the Jake Jarmel book and I understand you worked with him very closely on this.
S05E04,ELAINE,Yes (clears her throat) yes I did.
S05E04,LIPPMAN,"And uh, anyway I was just reading your final edit and um, there seems to be an inordinate number of exclamation points."
S05E04,ELAINE,"Uh well um, I felt that the writing lacked certain emotion and intensity."
S05E04,LIPPMAN,"Ah, (reads an excerpt) ""It was damp and chilly afternoon, so I decided to put on my sweatshirt!"""
S05E04,ELAINE,"Right, well..."
S05E04,LIPPMAN,You put exclamation point after sweatshirt?
S05E04,ELAINE,"That's that's correct, I-I felt that the character doesn't like to be ch-ch-chilly..."
S05E04,LIPPMAN,"I see, (reads another excerpt) ""I pulled the lever on the machine, but the Clark bar didn't come out!"" Exclamation point?"
S05E04,ELAINE,"Well, yeah, you know how frustrating that can be when you keep putting quarters and quarters in to machine and then (prrt) nothing comes out..."
S05E04,LIPPMAN,Get rid of the exclamation points...
S05E04,ELAINE,"Ok, ok ok ..."
S05E04,LIPPMAN,I hate exclamation points...
S05E04,ELAINE,...ok I'll just....
S05E04,JERRY,'Dear Barry. Consider this letter to be official termination of our relationship effective immediately.'
S05E04,KRAMER,Exclamation point.
S05E04,ELAINE,You still have no proof.
S05E04,KRAMER,"Elaine, he was sniffing like crazy around me."
S05E04,JERRY,'I will expect all funds in form of cashier checks no later than the 18th'.
S05E04,KRAMER,Double exclamation point!
S05E04,NEWMAN,Will that take care of ours too?
S05E04,JERRY,"Yeah, I'll give you yours as soon as I get my money back."
S05E04,NEWMAN,"Hey, you want me to mail it? I'm on my way out anyway."
S05E04,JERRY,"Yeah, thanks."
S05E04,NEWMAN,It'll be my pleasure.
S05E04,NEWMAN,See'ya later.
S05E04,JERRY,You know this...
S05E04,KRAMER,"Hey, Ralph."
S05E04,JERRY,Hi Ralph.
S05E04,RALPH,What's up fellas? That'll be 14.30.
S05E04,JERRY,All right.
S05E04,KRAMER,"Mushrooms, you got mushrooms Jerry?"
S05E04,JERRY,Yeah.
S05E04,KRAMER,What's the matter? You've got a cold?
S05E04,RALPH,"No man (sniffs again) Kramer, what is this?"
S05E04,KRAMER,It's a sweater.
S05E04,RALPH,What is it made out of?
S05E04,KRAMER,"I don't know, Jerry gave it to me."
S05E04,JERRY,"Mohair, I think."
S05E04,RALPH,"Mohair, that figures, I'm allergic to mohair."
S05E04,JERRY,You mean you just started sniffing?
S05E04,RALPH,"Yeah, mohair does it to me every time."
S05E04,JERRY,I was wearing that sweater in the coffee shop when Barry came in.
S05E04,KRAMER,"Jerry, I was wearing it in the bar."
S05E04,ELAINE,"The sweater! The sweater made him sniff! See, I told you he wasn't a drug addict."
S05E04,JERRY,"Oh no! The letter, Newman, it's got exclamation points all over it!"
S05E04,KRAMER,Not to mention the picture of him on the toilet.
S05E04,JERRY,The what??
S05E04,NEWMAN,After you.
S05E04,WOMAN,Thank you.
S05E04,WOMAN,Get your hands off of me! Johnny!!! Johnny!
S05E04,FRANK,"What do you mean you felt the material? What, with your fingers like this?"
S05E04,GEORGE,"So what, what is so bad about that?"
S05E04,ESTELLE,Who goes around feeling people's material? What can be gained by feeling a person's material? It's insanity!
S05E04,FRANK,"What ever happened to ""Why, that's a lovely dress you have on. May I have this dance?""!!"
S05E04,ELAINE,You are really lucky Newman never mailed that letter.
S05E04,JERRY,"Sorry I'm late, I just came from a meeting with my lawyer."
S05E04,ELAINE,What is this?
S05E04,JERRY,It's a letter from your friend Barry Prophet's lawyer.
S05E04,ELAINE,"He is filing a chapter eleven. Why, what's going on, why is he filing a chapter eleven?"
S05E04,JERRY,"Bankruptcy, bankruptcy...as in I've taken your money and spent it on drugs!"
S05E04,ELAINE,"What do you mean, I thought it was the sweater."
S05E04,KRAMER,"All right, What about the money?"
S05E04,JERRY,"What about the money? Apparently if I had dissolved my relationship with him prior to his filing chapter eleven, I've could've got the money back. Which I would've done, if a certain imbecile had been able to get to a mailbox and mail a letter!!"
S05E04,NEWMAN,"Pair of bear claws, please."
S05E04,WOMAN,Nice.
S05E04,JERRY,Think so?
S05E04,WOMAN,"Yeah, what is it?"
S05E04,JERRY,"Half silk, half cotton, half linen. How can you go wrong?"
S05E05,STAN,"...And then baby's head comes out, and I'm screaming and my brother who's been videotaping the whole thing turns green, his eyes roll up in his head and he blacks out, he drops the camera, the camera breaks, and then, the placenta comes flying out."
S05E05,ELAINE,Whoa.
S05E05,STAN,And then doctor says...
S05E05,JERRY,"(interrupting) Thanks, that's enough."
S05E05,STAN,"Will you look at that kid. Sucking away. Sucking like there's no tomorrow. Suck, suck, suck..."
S05E05,JERRY,"(Looking away) Yeah, yeah, yeah."
S05E05,STAN,"Look at that Jerry, look at that. Sucking, sucking..."
S05E05,JERRY,"Yeah, I looked. I saw."
S05E05,STAN,"This doesn't make you uncomfortable, does it?"
S05E05,JERRY,"No, Uncomfortable? Not at all. (ASIDE TO ELAINE) My friend's wife's breast sticking out - why would that make me uncomfortable?"
S05E05,STAN,Look at him.
S05E05,JERRY,So how long do they do this?
S05E05,STAN,"Jus, a year or two."
S05E05,JERRY,No break?
S05E05,STAN,After that comes the weaning.
S05E05,JERRY,"So after the sucking, comes the weaning."
S05E05,ELAINE,First the sucking then the weaning.
S05E05,JERRY,"Well, you gotta wean."
S05E05,STAN,Gotta wean.
S05E05,ELAINE,Must wean.
S05E05,GEORGE,What about that spot I got?
S05E05,JERRY,"Yeah, I saw the spot."
S05E05,GEORGE,"You open the door to the car, boom, you walk right into the hospital. Eh, You can't beat that spot. (starts doing a little dance) I am on a roll. I'm just willing these great parking spots."
S05E05,JERRY,George...
S05E05,GEORGE,"Maybe the baby would like to see my spot. A positive, uplifting message to start his life out with. Huh, You can still get a great space in this city - if you apply yourself."
S05E05,JERRY,(to Elaine) Where's Kramer? Shouldn't he be here by now.
S05E05,ELAINE,Did you give him the room number?
S05E05,JERRY,"Ya, 1397."
S05E05,KRAMER,"1937, 1937, 1937..."
S05E05,PATIENT,Excuse me. Do you know where the elevator is?
S05E05,KRAMER,"Uh ya, it's right around the corner there."
S05E05,KRAMER,1937.
S05E05,KRAMER,"Oh! God, It's a Pig man! A pig man!"
S05E05,STAN,"..So anyway, Jerry, Elaine, we have something we want to ask you."
S05E05,GEORGE,You gotta look at this. I pulled it in perfectly equidistant from the car in front of me and the car behind me.
S05E05,JERRY,Will you shut up George.
S05E05,ELAINE,I'm taking a cab home. I can't this anymore.
S05E05,JERRY,You were saying Stan? I-I'm sorry about that.
S05E05,STAN,Myra and I would like you and Elaine to be the Godparents of Steven.
S05E05,ELAINE,"Huuh, Wow."
S05E05,JERRY,Me? Godfather?
S05E05,STAN,Yes.
S05E05,JERRY,"(a la ""Don Corleone"") Never go against the family, Elaine."
S05E05,ELAINE,What?
S05E05,KRAMER,"Hey, I just saw a pig man! A pig man! Ya know he was sleeping and then he woke up and he looked up at me an-and he made this horrible sound, this (Quells like a pig)."
S05E05,GEORGE,"Kramer, what the hell are you talking about?"
S05E05,KRAMER,I'm talking about the pig man. I went into the wrong room and there he was.
S05E05,GEORGE,A pig-man?
S05E05,KRAMER,"A pig-man. Half pig, half man!"
S05E05,ELAINE,"That's great Kramer... So-So, anyway, tell us what's involved in being a Godparent."
S05E05,JERRY,"(a la ""Don Corleione"") Elaine, never ask me about my business!.... (SHEEPISH) ""Godfather."""
S05E05,STAN,The most important thing is you help with the bris.
S05E05,JERRY,The bris?
S05E05,KRAMER,A bris? You mean circumcision?
S05E05,STAN,Ya.
S05E05,KRAMER,I would advise against that.
S05E05,ELAINE,"Wha, Kramer. It's a tradition."
S05E05,KRAMER,"Ya well, so was uh sacrificing virgins to appease the gods, but we don't do that anymore."
S05E05,JERRY,"Well, maybe we should."
S05E05,GEORGE,"(knocks on the window) Hey, why are all those people milling around my car?"
S05E05,KRAMER,I don't know.
S05E05,JERRY,Maybe they're admiring your spot.
S05E05,KRAMER,They're all looking up.
S05E05,GEORGE,"Hey, there's a guy up the roof."
S05E05,KRAMER,Whoa. That's the guy that I told where the elevator was.
S05E05,GEORGE,"Oh well, I hope he doesn't jum..."
S05E05,"GEORGE, ELAINE, KRAMER, JERRY, & STAN",Oh my!
S05E05,GEORGE,My car! My caaaaarrrr!
S05E05,ELAINE,A Mohel! What the hell is a Mohel?
S05E05,JERRY,A Mohel is the person that performs the circumcision.
S05E05,ELAINE,"Where am I going to find a Mohel? (LOOKING THROUGH THE YELLOW PAGES, MUTTERING) Motels, models... How do you find a Mohel?"
S05E05,JERRY,"Oh, finding a Mohel is a piece of cake. Any idiot can find a Mohel. I have to hold the baby while they do it. That's a tough job. How would you like that?"
S05E05,ELAINE,"Hey Jerry, you ever seen one?"
S05E05,JERRY,You mean that wasn't uh.
S05E05,ELAINE,Yeah.
S05E05,JERRY,No.. you?
S05E05,ELAINE,Ya.
S05E05,JERRY,What'd you think?
S05E05,ELAINE,"(shakes her head) No, had no face, no personality. It was like a martian. But hey, you know that's me."
S05E05,JERRY,Hey.
S05E05,GEORGE,"Well I just got the estimate. It's going to cost more to fix that roof than the car's worth, So I'm going over to see that hospital administrator today. Someone is gonna pay for this damage and it's not gonna be me."
S05E05,JERRY,"Ah, you're screwed."
S05E05,GEORGE,"I know, swan dives from twenty floors up, lands right on top. What do I got a bulls eye up there? He couldn't move over two feet? Land on the sidewalk. It's city property."
S05E05,ELAINE,Well I have to interview a Mohel.
S05E05,JERRY,How about our little Elaine huh? Attended the finest finishing schools on the Eastern seaboard. Equestrian competitions. Debutante balls. Look at her now. Interviewing Mohels.
S05E05,KRAMER,YEA!
S05E05,JERRY,What's the matter?
S05E05,ELAINE,Are you alright?
S05E05,KRAMER,"Don't even question my instincts, because my instincts are honed. (REPAPER) Look at that."
S05E05,JERRY,What now?
S05E05,KRAMER,Look look.
S05E05,JERRY,"(Kramer shows Jerry and Elaine the paper) ""Hospital receives grant to conduct DNA research"".."" Government funds genetic research at area hospital"" ... Yeah, so?"
S05E05,KRAMER,"pig-man, baby. pig-man."
S05E05,ELAINE,If I hear about this pig-man one more time...
S05E05,KRAMER,"Hey, I'm tellin ya the pig-man is alive. The government has been experimenting with pig-men since the fifties."
S05E05,JERRY,"Oh, will you stop it. Just because a hospital studying DNA research doesn't mean they're creating a race of mutant pig-men!"
S05E05,KRAMER,Jerry wake up to reality. It's a military thing. They're probably creating a whole army of pig warriors.
S05E05,GEORGE,"I tell you something. I wish there were pig-men. You get a few of these pig-men walking around suddenly I'm looking a whole lot better. Then if somebody wants to fix me up at least they could say, ""Hey he's no pig-man!"""
S05E05,JERRY,"Believe me, there'd be plenty of women going for these pig-men. Whatever the deformity is there's always some group of perverts that's attracted to it. ""Oo that little tail really turns me on."""
S05E05,ELAINE,(MUMBLES) That's just about enough
S05E05,JERRY,"Oh, what's the matter this doesn't interest you?"
S05E05,ELAINE,"Oh, no, it's fascinating, but could you do me a favor, could ya tape the rest of the pig-men and the women who love them discussion and I'll listen to it the next time I'm here. I've gotta go find a Mohel."
S05E05,KRAMER,"You know, you should call this off, Elaine. It's a barbaric ritual."
S05E05,ELAINE,"Well, perhaps one day when the pig-men roam free it will be stopped Kramer. Until then, off with their heads."
S05E05,GEORGE,"But Kramer, isn't it a question of hygiene?"
S05E05,KRAMER,"It's a myth. Besides, it makes sex more pleasurable."
S05E05,GEORGE,Yeah. So how does that help me?
S05E05,JERRY,"(TO GEORGE) Hey George, you ever see one?"
S05E05,GEORGE,"Yeah, my roommate in college."
S05E05,JERRY,So what'd you think?
S05E05,GEORGE,(thinks for a second) I got used to it.
S05E05,JERRY,"Alright, I'm waiting. I-I want to see the pig-man. Show me the pig- man."
S05E05,KRAMER,"Oh, don't worry. I'm gonna show you, and you'll never be the same."
S05E05,JERRY,"Maybe he's just a guy with a nose like this. (holds his nose up like a pig) You know a lot of people have a nose like this, they're not necessarily pig-men."
S05E05,KRAMER,"Believe me, Jerry, somewhere in this hospital the anguished ""oink"" of pig-man cries out for help."
S05E05,JERRY,"Well, if I hear an anguished ""oink"", I'm outta here. I-I don't see any pig-men. Look (HE POINTS AT PASSERBY) Human, human, human... (HE LOOKS DOWN CORRIDOR, WITH ALARM.) (WITH MOCK ALARM) Wait a second! (Grabs Kramer)"
S05E05,KRAMER,What?!
S05E05,JERRY,"Oh, it's George."
S05E05,GEORGE,Alright the administrator's on the third floor. I'll meet you guys back at the car.
S05E05,KRAMER,Wait wait George. You got room in the car for the pig-man huh?
S05E05,GEORGE,The pig-man can take the bus.
S05E05,KRAMER,"George, if the pig-man had a car, he would give you a ride."
S05E05,GEORGE,How do you know? What if pig-man had a two-seater?
S05E05,KRAMER,Be realistic George.
S05E05,GEORGE,"I'll tell you what, if pig-man shows up, we'll squeeze him in. I'll see you later."
S05E05,KRAMER,Yea.
S05E05,MRS. SWEEDLER,"Mr. Costanza, come in, come in. It's been a very trying couple of days around the hospital. Doctors, patients, everyone, just grief stricken over this unfortunate occurrence."
S05E05,GEORGE,"Well, I join them in their grief."
S05E05,MRS. SWEEDLER,"Horrible thing. Flew right past the children's wing. All the sick children, in the playroom, looking out the window, just traumatized by the incident. Apparently, they thought he was flying. You know how children are, ""Oh look. A man is flying. A man is flying"" And then, splat..."
S05E05,GEORGE,"That's where I come in. Umm, on splat. Uh, you see, Mrs. Sweedler, or is it hospital administrator Sweedler?"
S05E05,MRS. SWEEDLER,Mrs. Sweedler's fine.
S05E05,GEORGE,"Mrs. Sweedler thank you. Y-You see, this tragedy affected me in a very, very personal way."
S05E05,MRS. SWEEDLER,How is that?
S05E05,GEORGE,"Yes, well you see, the deceased landed on my car. The uh splat, as it were, actually occurred on the roof of my car. Now of course I can't help but feel that had it been a convertible this whole tragedy might have been averted but I've never been the kind of guy to buy a convertible, what with the baldness and everything."
S05E05,MRS. SWEEDLER,Well I have known bald men who owned convertibles. They wore a hat.
S05E05,GEORGE,"Yes but then everything is all pulled down and it's jus.. Anyway. The damage, unfortunately, has marred an otherwise fine automobile, rendering it virtually undriveable."
S05E05,Mrs. SWEEDLER,"(STIFFENING) Yes, well, that is a shame."
S05E05,GEORGE,"Yes, a shame. That is exactly how I would put it. Now Mrs. Sweedler, with all due discretion and sensitivity, and taking in the whole scope of the situation, I just can't help but think that, the hospital is somehow responsible for compensating the other, still living 'victim' of horrendous, horrendous tragedy."
S05E05,MRS. SWEEDLER,Mr.Constanza.
S05E05,GEORGE,Yes.
S05E05,MRS. SWEEDLER,A man plummeted tragically to his ultimate demise -
S05E05,GEORGE,Yes.
S05E05,MRS. SWEEDLER,"... and you greedily, callously want to profit from it?"
S05E05,GEORGE,"(PULLING OUT ESTIMATE OUT OF HIS POCKET) Well, profit. I think you'll see from the estimate that I'm not really profiting that much. They might be a little high, but.."
S05E05,MRS. SWEEDLER,"Get out! Get out, now! Get out of my office."
S05E05,GEORGE,Should I leave this..?
S05E05,MRS. SWEEDLER,GET OUT!
S05E05,KRAMER,"Excuse me. What happened to the man, that was in this room before?"
S05E05,RESIDENT,I don't know what you're talking about.
S05E05,KRAMER,You know. (HE PUSHES HIS NOSE UP WITH HIS THUMB).
S05E05,RESIDENT,No.
S05E05,KRAMER,(STILL HOLDING HIS NOSE UP ) This doesn't look familiar to you?
S05E05,RESIDENT,"Uh, Sir?"
S05E05,KRAMER,"Look, I know what's going on. The oink, oink."
S05E05,RESIDENT,Yes well if you'll excuse me. I really have some patients I have to attend to.
S05E05,KRAMER,"(TOUGH TALKING) Now listen to me you little quack, There was a half man, half pig in that room over there. Now where is he?! Where is he?!"
S05E05,RESIDENT,Half-what?
S05E05,KRAMER,"You know what I mean - pork, sausage, (A LA PORKY PIG) A-deek-a-deek-a- deek th-th-th-that's all folks."
S05E05,RESIDENT,I think he's been released.
S05E05,KRAMER,He's lying.
S05E05,JERRY,"Alright Kramer, enough of this. Let's go find George."
S05E05,KRAMER,Alright you go ahead.
S05E05,JERRY,Kramer.
S05E05,JERRY,Where's the Mohel?
S05E05,ELAINE,He'll be here.
S05E05,JERRY,He's late already.
S05E05,ELAINE,Relax. You'd think you were getting whacked.
S05E05,JERRY,"I don't know why he asked me to be the Godfather. We're not even that close of friends. Just cause we're on the softball team, I'm the pitcher, he's the catcher he thinks we have a special relationship?"
S05E05,ELAINE,I thought pitchers and catchers did have a special rapport.
S05E05,JERRY,Well maybe in hardball with all the signals and everything but I'm just lobbing it in. We don't have any conferences. He doesn't come out to the mound and encourage me.
S05E05,ELAINE,What about me? I mean I just watched a few games with her sitting in the stands.
S05E05,JERRY,Don't they have any closer friends. They're level jumping on our friendship.
S05E05,ELAINE,Yes it is level jumping.
S05E05,GEORGE,So uh... been to a bris before?
S05E05,WOMAN,No.
S05E05,GEORGE,"I've been to a few of em. If you uh start to get woozy later, which is quite common, stay close to me. I'll get you through it. (chuckles)"
S05E05,WOMAN,I'm a cardiologist. I think I'll manage.
S05E05,GEORGE,Oh.
S05E05,KRAMER,"We're not talking about a manicure. Imagine, this is going to be his first memory. Of his parents just standing there while some stranger (Does some motions of cutting; Myra sobs more) cutting off a piece of his manhood and then serves a catered lunch."
S05E05,STAN,(Seeing Myra run away sobbing) Myra?
S05E05,ELAINE,"Kramer, what's the matter with you?"
S05E05,KRAMER,Me?
S05E05,ELAINE,"(to everyone) Oh, that's the Mohel."
S05E05,ALL,"(ADLIB) It's the Mohel! the Mohel is here! Thank God, the Mohel is here."
S05E05,ELAINE,Hello.
S05E05,MOHEL,"(to Elaine) Hello, Hello (shaking hands with Jerry) Hello, I'm the Mohel."
S05E05,JERRY,Hello.
S05E05,MOHEL,"(cont'd) (shakes Stan's hand) It's very nice to meet you all... (A PAN CLANGS TO THE GROUND. THE MOHEL SNAPS.) Oh! What was that?!? Jeez. Scared the hell out of me. My god. I almost had a heart attack! (THE CROWD GROWS UNEASY) (CALMING DOWN) Ok, I'm fine, I'm fine. Anyway, we're here to perform the mitzvah of the bris... (The Baby starts crying) (WITH INCREASING TENSION) ...Is the baby gonna cry like that? Is that how the baby cries, with the loud, sustained, squealing cry, 'cause that could pose a problem. Do you have any control of your child 'cause this will be the time to exercise it when baby is crying in that high-pitched, squealing tone that can drive you insane!!!"
S05E05,ELAINE,Did you find the place alright?
S05E05,MOHEL,"Did I find it alright? Could you send me to a more dangerous neighborhood? I'm dreading walking back to the subway, someone shouldn't crack me over the head and steal my bag, Because I'll be lying there and people will spit on me and empty my pockets. I'll be lying in the gutter like a bum, like a dog, like a mutt, like a mongrel, like an animal! God forbid anybody should help me or call an ambulance. Oh no, that's too much trouble to pick up a phone and press a few buttons. Ahh! What's the point."
S05E05,ELAINE,"(setting down her glass) Oh, ya haha."
S05E05,MOHEL,"(TO ELAINE INTERRUPTING) Darling, you see where that glass is? How that glass is near the edge of the table. You got the whole table there to put the glass, why you chose the absolute edge, so half the glass is hanging off the table, you breath and that glass falls over, then you're gonna have broken glass on the carpet, embedded in the carpet fibers, deep, deep in the shag, broken glass, bits of broken glass that you never get out. you can't get it out with a vacuum cleaner. Even on your hands and knees with a magnifying glass, you can't get all the pieces, and then you think you got it all and two years later, you're walkin' barefoot and you step on a piece of broken glass and you kill yourself, is that what you want? I don't think you want that, is it? .. Do ya? Huh?"
S05E05,ELAINE,(to Myra) He's very highly recommended. So...
S05E05,MOHEL,(to George) You're holding the baby?
S05E05,GEORGE,"(getting up out of his chair to get out of the Mohel's way) No, No."
S05E05,MOHEL,Hello! Who's holding the baby?!? Who's holding the baby?
S05E05,JERRY,(uncertain) Yeah. I'm holding the baby.
S05E05,ELAINE,"(pushing Jerry over to the Mohel) Ok, go."
S05E05,JERRY,I'm going.
S05E05,ELAINE,Go.
S05E05,JERRY,I'm going.
S05E05,ELAINE,C'mon
S05E05,JERRY,Don't push me.
S05E05,MOHEL,Okay. you sit here. Now I need the baby. Bring me the baby. I need the baby!
S05E05,KRAMER,"No, I'm not going to let this happen."
S05E05,ALL,(numerous voices) Kramer! Let go of the baby! Kramer!
S05E05,MOHEL,"People compose yourselves. (Shouting as the struggle ends) This is a bris. We are performing a bris here, not a burlesque show. This is not a school play! This is not a baggy pants farce! This is a bris. An sacred, ancient ceremony, symbolizing the covenant between God and Abraham... or something. (The Mohel opens his bag to start the process but drops it and his instruments fall out. People attempt to help him out) No! Don't touch it! Don't touch a thing!"
S05E05,ELAINE,Ok.
S05E05,MOHEL,"(muttering to Jerry).. I coulda been a kosher butcher like my brother. The money's good. There's a union, with benefits. And, cows have no families. You make a mistake with a cow, you move on with your life... Anyway."
S05E05,JERRY,Hurry up George! Step on it!
S05E05,GEORGE,"Alright, alright!"
S05E05,JERRY,That damn Mohel - he circumcised my finger! The Mohel circumcised my finger!
S05E05,ELAINE,You flinched.
S05E05,JERRY,"Flinched? I did not flinch. George, did I flinch?"
S05E05,ELAINE,Oh how would he know. He blacked out. He fainted.
S05E05,GEORGE,"It was very traumatic. The last thing I remember is you flinching. Then, everything went black."
S05E05,JERRY,Who's got a tissues? I need more tissues! Look at this thing. It's my phone finger!
S05E05,GEORGE,"Be careful, you're getting blood all over the car."
S05E05,KRAMER,What about the baby?
S05E05,JERRY,Oh the baby's fine. They just took him to the hospital as a precautionary measure. But look at me. I'm the one who's hurt.
S05E05,ELAINE,Would you stop it? You're just gonna need a few stitches.
S05E05,JERRY,A few stitches? I've never had stitches. I'll be deformed. I can't live with that. It goes against my whole personality. It's not me!
S05E05,GEORGE,"Hey look a that - boy are you lucky - another great spot - right in front of the hospital. In an emergency yet! How lucky are you huh? Is that unbelievable? How unbelievable is that huh? Come on, give it to me, give it to me."
S05E05,GEORGE,I have never seen a Mohel like that.
S05E05,JERRY,That was a one in a million Mohel.
S05E05,ELAINE,I said I'm sorry.
S05E05,JERRY,Look at this.
S05E05,KRAMER,Oh you'll be ok. I'll see you later.
S05E05,GEORGE,"Wha, where is he going?"
S05E05,JERRY,Oh well if it isn't Shakey the Mohel! Nice job on the circumcision but it's not supposed to be a finger.
S05E05,MOHEL,(REJERRY) The circumcision was perfect. The finger was your fault! You flinched!
S05E05,JERRY,"Oh who made you a Mohel? Whadya, get your degree from a matchbook?"
S05E05,MOHEL,(HE MAKES A SUDDEN MOVEMENT) Ya See! He flinched again!
S05E05,JERRY,"Nice Mohel picking, Elaine. You picked a helluva Mohel!"
S05E05,MOHEL,One more peep out of you and I'll slice you up like a smoked sturgeon.
S05E05,JERRY,"Oh don't threaten me, Butcher Boy."
S05E05,MOHEL,Butcher Boy?!
S05E05,JERRY,Ya what was this? (HE IMITATES MOHEL'S FLINCHING)
S05E05,MOHEL,What was this? (HE IMITATES JERRY)
S05E05,JERRY,It was not!
S05E05,ELAINE,"Jerry, be careful. The Mohel's got a knife!"
S05E05,STAN,"(holding the Mohel back) Hey, hey what's going on out here? You two should be ashamed of yourselves, both of ya!"
S05E05,MOHEL,"Ah, blood."
S05E05,ELAINE,"Oh, how's the baby?"
S05E05,STAN,There's nothing wrong with the baby.
S05E05,MYRA,The circumcision went fine.
S05E05,MOHEL,Thank god the flincher didn't harm the baby.
S05E05,STAN,Amen.
S05E05,MOHEL,"I will get you for this. This is my business, this is my life. No one ruins this for me. No one! (TO ELAINE) Here's my card."
S05E05,KRAMER,(off screen) Outta My Way!
S05E05,JERRY,"(struggling to open a bottle with his bandaged finger) I can't do it. (A LA GODFATHER) Look what they did to my boy, They massacred my boy."
S05E05,ELAINE,You really do the worst Godfather I ever heard. You're not even close.
S05E05,JERRY,"(walking over the the buzzer to answer it) Oh, that's the Flicks."
S05E05,GEORGE,"(ON PHONE) It's a '76 Chevy Impala. They stole it right in front of the hospital. I saw the guy drive off in it. Well he's about five feet tall, hairless, pink complexion.. (Elaine puts her finger on her nose) looks like a pig. Yeah, alright alright, thank you, thank you. (Kramer enters) So any word from the ""pig-man""?"
S05E05,KRAMER,No.
S05E05,GEORGE,No. And he's not a pig-man is he?
S05E05,KRAMER,"NO, he's not.. Just a fat little mental patient."
S05E05,JERRY,"Myra, Stan."
S05E05,MYRA,Don't touch him
S05E05,JERRY,What's the matter?
S05E05,STAN,"You're out, Jerry. You're out as Godfather. You too, Elaine. You're both out."
S05E05,ELAINE,But I didn't do anything.
S05E05,STAN,"No, no buts. We made up our minds. (turns to Kramer) We want Kramer. He showed us how much he cares about Steven."
S05E05,KRAMER,(Leaving A LA GODFATHER) Don't ever go against the family Jerry.
S05E05,STAN,(grabbing Kramer's hand) Godfather.
S05E05,MYRA,(grabbing Kramer's other hand) Godfather.
S05E05,KRAMER,Yes
S05E05,*Note,During this closing monologue; Jerry's finger is bandaged the same way it was during this episode.
S05E06,JERRY,"Professional tennis. To me I don't understand all the shushing. Why are they always shushing. Shh, shh. Don't the players know that we're there? Should we duck down behind the seats so they don't see us watching them? To me tennis is basically just ping-pong and the players are standing on the table. That's all it is. And that goofy scoring, you win one point and all the sudden you're up by 15. Two points, 30-love. 30-love. Sounds like an English call girl. ""That'll be 30, love... And could you be a little quieter next time, please, shh."""
S05E06,JERRY,Are these seats unbelievable or what?
S05E06,GEORGE,Where's the sunblock?
S05E06,JERRY,Here.
S05E06,GEORGE,25? You don't have anything higher?
S05E06,JERRY,"What, are you on Mercury?"
S05E06,GEORGE,"I need higher. This has paba in it, I need paba-free."
S05E06,JERRY,You got a problem with paba?
S05E06,GEORGE,"Yes, I have a problem with paba."
S05E06,JERRY,You don't even know what paba is.
S05E06,GEORGE,I know enough to stay away from it.
S05E06,ANNOUNCER,30-Love
S05E06,GEORGE,So are you going to Todd's party this weekend?
S05E06,JERRY,I'll go if someone else drives. You going?
S05E06,GEORGE,Gwen really wants to go.
S05E06,JERRY,You're bringing a date to a party?
S05E06,GEORGE,No good?
S05E06,JERRY,"A party is a bad date situation. It doesn't matter who you're with. You could be with J. Edgar Hoover. You don't want to sit and talk with Hoover all night. You want to circulate. (Makes hand motions) Ho, ho, ho."
S05E06,GEORGE,Why'd you pick Hoover? Was he that interesting to talk to?
S05E06,JERRY,"Well I would think, with the law enforcement and the cross dressing. Seems like an interesting guy."
S05E06,GEORGE,"Yeah I guess. What can I do? I gotta take her with me. Todd introduced us, I'm obligated."
S05E06,JERRY,That woman is absolutely stunning.
S05E06,GEORGE,"Who, the Croat? [the tennis player]"
S05E06,JERRY,"Not the Croat, the lineswoman. That is the most beautiful lineswoman I've ever seen."
S05E06,GEORGE,"Yeah, she's a B.L."
S05E06,JERRY,B.L.?
S05E06,GEORGE,Beautiful lineswoman. Alright listen uh I'm going to go to the concession stand and get some real sunblock. You want anything? Jerry? (Jerry is staring at the lineswoman) Jerry?
S05E06,COWORKER,"You know, I just heard the Lexington line is out."
S05E06,ELAINE,"(annoyed) Uh, you are kidding me. How am I supposed to get to this meeting?"
S05E06,COWORKER,Take a car service. We have an account.
S05E06,ELAINE,"Oh forget it, I hate those. Everytime I take one, the driver will *not* stop talking to me. No matter how disinterested I seem he just keeps yakking away. Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. Why does everything always have to have a social componant? Now a stage coach, that would have been a good situation for me. Cause I'm in the coach, and the driver is way up there on the stage."
S05E06,COWORKER,"Well you're not going to get a cab now. Four thirty in the afternoon? Read a magazine, keep your head down."
S05E06,ELAINE,"Yea, I guess that could work."
S05E06,ANNOUNCER,"And that is it. The match to Ms. Natalia Valdoni. Coming up next, mens single, but for now let's stop a minute and take a look at our beautiful tennis center backdrop."
S05E06,KRAMER,"Hey, hey, it's George."
S05E06,ANNOUNCER,Holy cow it's a scorcher. Boy I bet you that guy can cover a lot of court.
S05E06,ANNOUNCER #2,"Hey buddy, they got a new invention. It's called a napkin. We'll take a station break and continue with more action..."
S05E06,DRIVER,"Dag Gavershole Plaza huh? (Elaine ignores him) Pendant Publishing, that's books right? (Elaine is annoyed and still ignoring him) Miss?"
S05E06,ELAINE,Pardon me?
S05E06,DRIVER,"Books, that's what you do?"
S05E06,ELAINE,Yeah.
S05E06,DRIVER,"Yeah, I don't read much myself, (Elaine is annoyed) well you know besides the paper. Yeah a lot of people read to relax, not me. You know what I do?"
S05E06,ELAINE,"You know I-I'm having a lot of trouble, um, hearing you back here. So..."
S05E06,DRIVER,(Yelling) I said you know what I do (Elaine is very annoyed) when I want to relax? The Jumble. Hey uh do you make a book of Jumbles?
S05E06,ELAINE,I'm going to have to be honest with you. I'm going deaf.
S05E06,DRIVER,Going deaf?
S05E06,ELAINE,What?
S05E06,DRIVER,Oh I-I-I'm sorry.
S05E06,ELAINE,It can be very frustrating.
S05E06,DRIVER,Hey what about a hearing aid?
S05E06,ELAINE,"Am I fearing AIDS? Oh, yeah sure, who isn't. But you know you gotta live your life."
S05E06,DRIVER,"No, no I said. Ehhh, forget it. (Elaine looks pleased)"
S05E06,JERRY,I can't take my eyes off that lineswoman. The woman is absolutely mesmerizing.
S05E06,GEORGE,Boy you are really smitten.
S05E06,JERRY,I gotta talk to her. What do you think?
S05E06,GEORGE,Cold? How are you going to do that? You're not one of those guys.
S05E06,JERRY,I'm going to psyche myself into it like those people that just walk across the hot coals.
S05E06,GEORGE,They're not mocked and humiliated when they get to the other side.
S05E06,JERRY,I have to. I won't be able to live with myself.
S05E06,GEORGE,"Wait a minute Jerry, there's a bigger issue here. If you go through that wall and become one of those guys I'll be left here on this side. Take me with you."
S05E06,JERRY,I can't.
S05E06,GEORGE,What are you going to say?
S05E06,JERRY,"I don't know, ""Hi""."
S05E06,GEORGE,"(laughing) You think you're going to the other side with ""Hi""? You're not going to make it."
S05E06,RADIO,Base to 92 come in
S05E06,DRIVER,Yes this is 92
S05E06,RADIO,After this go back to city for a 600 pickup
S05E06,DRIVER,Righteo
S05E06,RADIO,794 Bleeker the party's Hanks. Tom Hanks.
S05E06,ELAINE,Tom Hanks? After me you're picking up Tom Hanks? I love him.
S05E06,DRIVER,So I guess your hearing goes in and out huh?
S05E06,ELAINE,(realizing he caught her) Yeah. Yes it does...
S05E06,DRIVER,Yeah. You know what I think? I think you made that whole thing up.
S05E06,ELAINE,"No no, no no."
S05E06,DRIVER,"Yeah yeah, I know your type. You're too good to make conversation with someone like me. Oh god forbid you could discuss the Jumbles. But to go so far as to pretend you're almost deaf, I mean that is truly disgusting. And Mr. Tom Hanks, may I say he too would be disgusted by your behavior."
S05E06,JERRY,"Excuse me. (Woman ignores him) Excuse me? (Still ignores him) Oh that's nice. That's right ignore me. That's real polite. Yea nobody's even talking to you. All you big lineswoman. Oh you've got some kind of a cool job. I know your type thinking your too good for everyone, but it's women like you (woman turns around and notices him) oh well, what are you deaf?"
S05E06,LAURA,Bingo.
S05E06,KRAMER,And you're saying she's deaf.
S05E06,JERRY,"I'm not *saying* she's deaf, she's deaf."
S05E06,KRAMER,Can't hear a thing.
S05E06,JERRY,Can't hear a thing.
S05E06,KRAMER,And you're going to go out with her.
S05E06,JERRY,"Yeah, isn't that something?"
S05E06,ELAINE,Hey.
S05E06,JERRY & KRAMER,Hey.
S05E06,KRAMER,Hey I know how to sign.
S05E06,JERRY,Really?
S05E06,KRAMER,"Yeah when I was 8, I had a deaf cousin who lived with us for about a year. (signing as he speaks) So I haven't been able to do it in a while."
S05E06,ELAINE,What is this about?
S05E06,JERRY,I met this deaf lineswoman at the tennis match.
S05E06,ELAINE,"You are kidding. That is amazing. (She pushes Jerry, Jerry falls back into Kramer.) I just took a car service from work and to get the driver to not talk to me, I pretended I was going deaf."
S05E06,JERRY,Wow good plan.
S05E06,ELAINE,"Oh didn't work. He caught me hearing. Alright it's terrible, but I'm not a terrible person."
S05E06,JERRY & KRAMER,No.
S05E06,ELAINE,"No. When I shoo squirrels away, I always say ""get out of here"". I never ever throw things at them and try to injure them like other people."
S05E06,JERRY,That's nice.
S05E06,ELAINE,"Yeah, and when I see freaks in the street I never, ever stare at them. Yet, I'm careful not to look away, see, because I want to make the freaks feel comfortable."
S05E06,JERRY,(turning to Kramer) That's nice for the freaks.
S05E06,ELAINE,"Yeah, and I don't poof up my hair when I got to a movie so people behind me can see. I've got to make it up to this guy or I won't be able to live with myself. What can I do?"
S05E06,JERRY,"Why don't you get him some tickets or something, how about that friend of yours that works at the ticket agency."
S05E06,KRAMER,"Yeah yeah Pete, he can get you great tickets to something."
S05E06,ELAINE,Really?
S05E06,KRAMER,Like a rock concert. Whatever you like.
S05E06,ELAINE,"Oh great, thanks Kramer."
S05E06,KRAMER,"You got it. Hey Jerry, do me a favor. The next time you see that lineswoman ask her how those ball boys get those jobs. I would love to be able to do that."
S05E06,JERRY,"Kramer, I think perhaps you've overlooked one of the key aspects of this activity. It's ball *boys*, not ball men. There are no ball men."
S05E06,ELAINE,Yeah I think he's right. I've never seen a ball man.
S05E06,KRAMER,Well there ought to be ball men.
S05E06,JERRY,"All right I'll talk to her. If you want to be a ball man go ahead, break the ball barrier. (Elaine drinks straight out of the orange juice container) Hey."
S05E06,ELAINE,Hey you know a friend of mine from work said that she saw George at the tennis match on TV yesterday.
S05E06,KRAMER,"Yeah, yeah me too. Yeah he was at the snack bar eating a hot fudge sundae. He had it all over his face. He was wearing that chocolate on his face like a beard and they got in there real nice and tight. And he's... (Imitates scooping up ice cream. Elaine and Jerry laugh)"
S05E06,GWEN,I'm sorry George.
S05E06,GEORGE,I don't understand things were going so great. What happened? Something must have happened.
S05E06,GWEN,"It's not you, it's me."
S05E06,GEORGE,"You're giving me the ""it's not you, it's me"" routine? I invented ""it's not you, it's me"". Nobody tells me it's them not me, if it's anybody it's me."
S05E06,GWEN,"All right, George, it's you."
S05E06,GEORGE,You're *damn* right it's me.
S05E06,GWEN,I was just trying to...
S05E06,GEORGE,I know what you were trying to do. Nobody does it better than me.
S05E06,GWEN,I'm sure you do it very well.
S05E06,GEORGE,Yes well unfortunately you'll never get the chance to find out.
S05E06,JERRY,But I thought things were going great.
S05E06,GEORGE,Yeah so did I.
S05E06,JERRY,Did she say why?
S05E06,GEORGE,"No. She tried to give me the ""it's not you, it's me"" routine."
S05E06,JERRY,But that's your routine.
S05E06,GEORGE,Yeah. Well aparently word's out.
S05E06,KRAMER,"Hey, Georgie, I saw you on TV yesterday."
S05E06,GEORGE,Really? At the tennis match?
S05E06,KRAMER,Yeah you were at the snack bar eating a hot fudge sundae.
S05E06,GEORGE,Get out of here. I didn't see any cameras there.
S05E06,KRAMER,"Oh, the cameras was, vrooom, there. The announcers, they made a couple of cracks about you."
S05E06,GEORGE,Cracks? What were they saying?
S05E06,KRAMER,That you had ice cream all over your face. They were talking about how funny you looked.
S05E06,GEORGE,"Oh my god, maybe Gwen saw it. Maybe that's what did it."
S05E06,KRAMER,Well I'll tell you it wasn't a pretty sight.
S05E06,GEORGE,She must have seen me eating it on TV.
S05E06,JERRY,So she sees you with hot fudge on your face and she ends it? You really think she would be that superficial?
S05E06,GEORGE,Why not. I would be.
S05E06,JERRY,"Hello... Oh hi dad... You saw him?... Really with the ice cream?... All right I'll talk to you later, bye."
S05E06,GEORGE,You're parents saw me on TV?
S05E06,JERRY,Yeah.
S05E06,GEORGE,This is nighmare. Kramer how long was I on?
S05E06,KRAMER,It felt like 8 seconds.
S05E06,GEORGE,"One-one-thousand, two-one-thousand, three-one-thousand."
S05E06,ELAINE,I heard you *really* inhaled that thing. Did anyone tape it?
S05E06,GEORGE,Can we move on?
S05E06,JERRY,He thinks Gwen broke up with him because she saw him eating the ice cream on TV.
S05E06,ELAINE,Oh come on. If she's that superficial you don't want her.
S05E06,GEORGE,Yes I do.
S05E06,ELAINE,So I guess you're not going to Todd's party on Friday.
S05E06,GEORGE,"Well I can't now, Gwen's going to be there."
S05E06,KRAMER,Well she should be the one that shouldn't go.
S05E06,JERRY,"Well if a couple breaks up and have plans to go to a neutral place, who withdraws? What's the etiquette?"
S05E06,KRAMER,Excellent question.
S05E06,JERRY,"I think she should withdraw. She's the breaker, he's the breakee. He needs to get on with his life."
S05E06,ELAINE,I beg to differ.
S05E06,JERRY,Really.
S05E06,ELAINE,He's the *loser*. She's the victor. To the victor belong the spoils.
S05E06,JERRY,"Well I don't care, I don't want to go anyway. I don't want to fight that traffic on Friday night."
S05E06,ELAINE,Well we can take the car service from my office.
S05E06,JERRY,Really?
S05E06,ELAINE,"Yeah, they don't know."
S05E06,KRAMER,"All right, I'll see you later."
S05E06,JERRY,Okay.
S05E06,KRAMER,(while eating a banana) Hey Georgie.
S05E06,GEORGE,"""To the victor goes the spoils."" What are you going to do tonight?"
S05E06,JERRY,Oh I got a date with Laura the lineswoman.
S05E06,GEORGE,Oh. (he stands there)
S05E06,JERRY,Why? (George fiddles with the lock on the door.) Well what are you doing?
S05E06,GEORGE,Well I was just going to wander the streets. Don't wanna tag along with you or anything.
S05E06,JERRY,"Oh, uh, do you want to come with us?"
S05E06,GEORGE,"Jerry please, that's very nice, but, uh, (closes the door) where would we be going?"
S05E06,GEORGE,"So, I've got ice cream all over my face. There were no napkins there. Whoever it was that's responsible for stocking that concession stand cost me a relationship."
S05E06,LAURA,They never have napkins there.
S05E06,JERRY,Let's get the check. (Waves in the air) Is this uh considered signing? Do you do this when you want the check?
S05E06,LAURA,(does the same thing Jerry is doing) Yea.
S05E06,JERRY,"Really. I know a sign, that's my first sign."
S05E06,LAURA,"Uh, oh. That couple is breaking up."
S05E06,GEORGE,They're breaking up? How do you know?
S05E06,JERRY,She reads lips.
S05E06,GEORGE,What are they saying now?
S05E06,LAURA,"""It's not you, it's me."""
S05E06,GEORGE,"(Holding his drink up to his mouth) Oh my gosh, I just had a great idea. She could come to the party tomorrow and read Gwen's lips for me."
S05E06,JERRY,(Puts his hand over his mouth) What?
S05E06,GEORGE,"(Puts nuts into his mouth, and in the process covers his mouth) We bring her to the party, and she can tell me what Gwen is saying about me."
S05E06,JERRY,"(Holds his drink up to his mouth) She's not a novelty act, George. Where you hire her out for weddings and bar mitzvas."
S05E06,GEORGE,"(Puts his hands on his face, rubbing his eyes) Look. It's a skill, just like juggling. She probably enjoys showing it off."
S05E06,JERRY,(Puts his napkin over his mouth) I don't know George. I'm not sure about this.
S05E06,GEORGE,"(Puts his arms in the air, stretching, and covers his mouth with an arm) Could you ask her, just ask her. If she says no, case closed."
S05E06,JERRY,(Puts his hand on his chin over his mouth) All right.
S05E06,JERRY,"Uh Laura, George was wondering if..."
S05E06,LAURA,Sure. I'll do it.
S05E06,JERRY,So I really had a good time.
S05E06,LAURA,"Yeah, me too."
S05E06,JERRY,So you want to go to the party on Friday night?
S05E06,LAURA,Yeah.
S05E06,JERRY,"All right, we're taking a car service. So we'll swing by and pick you up. How about six? (Laura looks offended). Six is good. (Laura looks offended and angry). You got a problem with six? (Laura opens the door and gets out). What? What?"
S05E06,MAN,"Okay listen up people. There are plenty of you here, but we've only got two spots to fill. Good luck."
S05E06,BOY,"(to Kramer) Hey pops, isn't there a better way to spend your twilight years?"
S05E06,KRAMER,"I may be old, but I'm spry."
S05E06,BOY,The tryout lasts three and a half to four hours. Are you up for it?
S05E06,KRAMER,Oh I'll be up for it punk.
S05E06,JERRY,"See I was saying ""six"" but she thought I was saying ""sex"". We straightened the whole thing out though."
S05E06,GEORGE,"She confused ""six"" with ""sex""?"
S05E06,JERRY,Yeah.
S05E06,GEORGE,"Well if she can't tell ""six"" from ""sex"" then how is she going to lip read from across the room?"
S05E06,JERRY,"Well ""six"" and ""sex"" are close."
S05E06,GEORGE,"It's two completely different sounds. ""ih"" and ""eh""."
S05E06,JERRY,Eh.
S05E06,GEORGE,It seems like a problem.
S05E06,JERRY,Well I'm not dating any other deaf women.
S05E06,KRAMER,Hey guess who's going to be the new ball man for the finals.
S05E06,JERRY,You're kidding.
S05E06,KRAMER,Yeah. They said they haven't seen anybody go after balls with such gusto.
S05E06,GEORGE,"Oh, when is that car service coming?"
S05E06,JERRY,"In five minutes. He's then going to pick us up, then we're going to pick up Elaine, and Laura is going to meet us there."
S05E06,GEORGE,If this lip reading thing works tonight do you know how incredible this is going to be? It's like having Superman for your friend.
S05E06,JERRY,I know. It's like X-ray vision.
S05E06,GEORGE,"If we could just harness this power and use it for our own personal gain, there'd be no stopping us."
S05E06,NEWMAN,"Hey, hey, hey. (to Jerry) I hear you've got some lip reader working for you. You gotta let me use her for one day. Just one day."
S05E06,JERRY,Can't do it Newman.
S05E06,NEWMAN,"But Jerry, we've got this new supervisor down at the post office. He's working behind this glass. I know they're talking about me. They're going to transfer me, I know it. Two hours, give me two hours."
S05E06,JERRY,It's not going to happen.
S05E06,NEWMAN,"(Sinister) All right, all right. All right you go ahead. You go ahead and keep it secret. But you remember this. When you control the mail, you control... information."
S05E06,JERRY,Uh just pull over right there by the stop sign.
S05E06,DRIVER,(The same driver as before) Pardon me sir?
S05E06,JERRY,I said pull over by the stop sign.
S05E06,DRIVER,"I'm so sorry, you'll have to forgive me. I can't hear a damn thing. I went to that rock concert last night at the garden. My seats were right up agains the speaker. It's a heavy metal group. Metalla-something."
S05E06,KRAMER,-ca.
S05E06,DRIVER,Huh?
S05E06,GEORGE,What?
S05E06,JERRY,ca.
S05E06,GEORGE,ah.
S05E06,DRIVER,My ears are still ringing. Some woman's idea of a joke.
S05E06,DRIVER,Get out. Get out. Go on. Hey. Shut the door.
S05E06,JERRY,You know the whole idea of taking the car service was so I wouldn't have to fight the traffic on Friday night.
S05E06,JERRY,"I know. I'm late. Hey now I know two signs, (puts his hand in the air) check, and (points to his watch) late. Hey this is the guy you helped become the first ball man."
S05E06,LAURA,Congratulations.
S05E06,KRAMER,She doesn't know what she's talking about.
S05E06,TODD,Guys you made it.
S05E06,GEORGE,Hey hey.
S05E06,TODD,(to George) Hey buddy.
S05E06,JERRY,Hey Todd.
S05E06,TODD,Sorry to hear about Gwen.
S05E06,GEORGE,Why? Did she say something to you about why she broke up with me?
S05E06,TODD,Oh no. Tonight will be the first chance I've had to talk to her.
S05E06,GEORGE,Really?
S05E06,TODD,"Look George, I'm friends with both of you. But I can't betray her confidence by telling you anything."
S05E06,GEORGE,"I wouldn't hear of it, Todd. It's none of my business. But you should try to find out everything you possibly can. In fact, I'll even stay all the way on the other side of the room just so there's no chance of me overhearing anything."
S05E06,TODD,You are so centered.
S05E06,GEORGE,"Hey, grown-up. (they both chuckle, George notices Gwen enter the room) Oh my god, there she is. Go ahead, go ahead. (to the others) Let's go, let's go. All right what are they saying?"
S05E06,KRAMER,"""Hi Gwen, hi tide."""
S05E06,JERRY,Hi tide?
S05E06,KRAMER,Hi Todd.
S05E06,KRAMER,"""You've got something between your teeth"""
S05E06,GEORGE,Wheret?
S05E06,KRAMER,"No that's what he said. ""That's interesting. I love carrots, but I hate carrot soup. And I hate peas, but I love pea soup."" So do I."
S05E06,ELAINE,She's so wild. Can I borrow her for a few hours tomorrow afternoon?
S05E06,JERRY,No. If I lend her to you I'll have to lend her to everybody.
S05E06,GWEN,I don't envy you Todd. The place is going to be a mess.
S05E06,TODD,Well maybe you can stick around after everybody leaves and we can sweep together.
S05E06,KRAMER,"""Why don't you stick around and we can sleep together."""
S05E06,GEORGE,What?
S05E06,KRAMER,"""You want me to sleep with you?"""
S05E06,TODD,I don't want to sweep alone.
S05E06,KRAMER,"He says ""I don't want to sleep alone."" She says, oh boy, ""love to."""
S05E06,GEORGE,Alright that's it. (George walks across the room over to them.) So you get rid of me and now the two of you are going to sleep together?
S05E06,GWEN,What? You're crazy.
S05E06,KRAMER,"""What? You're crazy."""
S05E06,GEORGE,I heard your whole conversation.
S05E06,GWEN,How?
S05E06,KRAMER,"""How?"""
S05E06,GEORGE,(looks back to the group) I can read lips. You said let's sleep together.
S05E06,GWEN,"No I didn't. I said ""sweep"". Let's sweep together, you know with a broom. Cleaning up."
S05E06,KRAMER,"""... with a broom, cleaning up."""
S05E06,GEORGE,Sweep?
S05E06,GWEN,Yes sweep.
S05E06,KRAMER,"""Yes sweep."""
S05E06,GEORGE,Cut it.
S05E06,KRAMER,"George says ""Cut it."""
S05E06,GEORGE,Cut it.
S05E06,KRAMER,"George is saying ""Cut it."""
S05E06,GEORGE,Cut it. (goes back to the group) (Yelling) Would you stop signing?
S05E06,KRAMER,What?
S05E06,GEORGE,"She said ""sweep together"" you idiots, not ""sleep together."""
S05E06,KRAMER,I know how to sign.
S05E06,GEORGE,"Ow. My eye, my eye."
S05E06,ELAINE,It's so amazing getting to see Monica Seles playing in the finals.
S05E06,JERRY,I know and on the first tournament of her comeback.
S05E06,JERRY,Thus ends the great ball man experiment.
S05E06,DRIVER,(The same driver as before) You with the tennis center?
S05E06,LAURA,Yep.
S05E06,DRIVER,Hey how about that ball man injuring Monica Seles. Wasn't that something.
S05E06,LAURA,I'm deaf.
S05E06,DRIVER,Oh. (Very suspicious look on his face.)
S05E06,JERRY,"I've always been a big fan of the little check move. You know (does the motion for the check) Check, Check. Unless the waiter isn't too shape then you gotta total it up. Sometimes they come over, ""Do you want the check?"" No I wanna be pen pals, can't you see what I'm doing here? I'm trying to be cool and impress people."
S05E07,ELAINE,Hmm!
S05E07,GEORGE,Fantastic!
S05E07,JERRY,I told ya. How good is this?
S05E07,GEORGE,Good.
S05E07,JERRY,How good?
S05E07,GEORGE,Very good.
S05E07,JERRY,I know it.
S05E07,ELAINE,They put real blue berries in this. And there's real blue berries. What kind did you get?
S05E07,JERRY,"Coffee. And they grind up the coffee beans, and put it in."
S05E07,ELAINE,Let me test-taste that. (tastes Jerry's yogurt)
S05E07,JERRY,Huh? Huh?
S05E07,ELAINE,Hmm! Rico!
S05E07,JERRY,Suave! And it's non-fat!
S05E07,GEORGE,"Ya-see, how could this not have any fat? It's too good."
S05E07,ELAINE,(offering her yogurt to George) You want to taste mine?
S05E07,GEORGE,"(offers his) Oh, you want to taste mine."
S05E07,ELAINE,"No, I don't."
S05E07,GEORGE,"Lo..k, if you want to taste mine, you don't have to offer me some of yours."
S05E07,ELAINE,"All right, let's just forget it."
S05E07,JERRY,"You know, Kramer's gonna clean up on this place."
S05E07,GEORGE,What do you mean?
S05E07,JERRY,He invested in it.
S05E07,GEORGE,No kidding?
S05E07,JERRY,Yeah. We've been coming here everyday. This is so fuck(bleeped)ing good.
S05E07,MARYEDITH,Jerry!
S05E07,JERRY,"Oh, I'm sorry."
S05E07,ELAINE,"All right, we should get going. But, I'm going to get a little bit more, okay?"
S05E07,GEORGE,"Oh, god. Look who's here."
S05E07,JERRY,Who is it?
S05E07,GEORGE,This guy from my old neighborhood. Lloyd Braun. He's a big advisor to Mayor Dinkins. He thinks he's so cool.
S05E07,JERRY,"Oh, oh.?"
S05E07,LLOYD,"Hey, George!"
S05E07,GEORGE,Hey-hay! Lloyd! Hey! My friend Jerry eh.
S05E07,LLOYD,Hi.
S05E07,JERRY,Hi.
S05E07,LLOYD,"So, I hear you're living back home now, is it?"
S05E07,GEORGE,"Yeah, there was a fire in my apartment."
S05E07,LLOYD,"Fire! Whoa! There's a lot of major chicks in this place, huh? (George nudges Jerry with his right arm) Something wrong with your arm?"
S05E07,GEORGE,"Uh, uh, yeah. Actually, the, uh, I-I bumped my elbow on a desk and uh injured something an.. now it sort of moves involuntarily."
S05E07,LLOYD,"Wow, that's a bitch, huh? So, how are your parents doing?"
S05E07,GEORGE,"Oh, pretty good."
S05E07,LLOYD,"This place does some business, huh?"
S05E07,GEORGE,"Yeah, this is my first time here. (nudges Jerry again)"
S05E07,LLOYD,"Hey, she's a doll. (looking at Elaine)"
S05E07,ELAINE,Hi!
S05E07,GEORGE,"Uh, Elaine, this is, uh, Lloyd."
S05E07,ELAINE,Hi!
S05E07,LLOYD,"Oh, hi! Very nice to meet you."
S05E07,ELAINE,"Nice to meet you, too!"
S05E07,LLOYD,"Well, I'm really sorry I gotta run now. (sets down his cup of yogurt and makes his way out) Well, take it easy, huh, George?"
S05E07,GEORGE,Yeah! Yeah.
S05E07,ELAINE,"(excited about Lloyd) Aaah. Boy, he is really cute!"
S05E07,GEORGE,He's a jerk. (nudges to his right but no one is there)
S05E07,JERRY,"He's gone, George."
S05E07,GEORGE,All right. All right.
S05E07,KRAMER,"So, there were a lot of people there, huh?"
S05E07,JERRY,"Oh, man, that yogurt place - you're going to make a fortune."
S05E07,KRAMER,Yeah.
S05E07,JERRY,They're doing an incredible business.
S05E07,KRAMER,"Yeah, well, I told you to go in on it."
S05E07,JERRY,How did you know?
S05E07,KRAMER,"Well, I tasted it at the one downtown. It's got a remarkable texture. You'd never know it was non-fat."
S05E07,JERRY,(answering the buzzer) Yeah?
S05E07,ELAINE,(on the buzzer) Buzz me.
S05E07,JERRY,"Hey, I had the show of my life last night. I ad-libbed like ten new minutes."
S05E07,KRAMER,"Yeah, but did you tape it?"
S05E07,JERRY,"(pulling out a tape from his pocket) Vvvvup. Right there. I got it. I did this thing on the Ottoman Empire. Like, what was this? A whole empire based on putting your feet up?"
S05E07,KRAMER,Yes!
S05E07,JERRY,"I'm telling you, I got like a whole new Tonight Show here."
S05E07,ELAINE,Hey!
S05E07,KRAMER,Hey!
S05E07,JERRY,What's the matter?
S05E07,ELAINE,"Oh, I was having lunch, and I bit down on the fork."
S05E07,JERRY,"Boy, it's hard to believe - with all that biting experience - a person could still make a mistake like that."
S05E07,KRAMER,(sort of falling backwords) Yowm!
S05E07,ELAINE,What?
S05E07,KRAMER,"Well, you're getting heavy."
S05E07,ELAINE,(quietly) What?
S05E07,KRAMER,"Yeah, you look like you put on (holds his hands out) five, (holds his hands wider) ten pounds."
S05E07,JERRY,Kramer!
S05E07,KRAMER,"I'll tell you something else, you're looking a little chunky yourself, buddy."
S05E07,JERRY,Me?
S05E07,KRAMER,Yeah.
S05E07,JERRY,No.
S05E07,ELAINE,"Where's your bathroom scale? (Jerry looks at her like 'where do you think?' Elaine and Jerry both go into the bathroom) Oh my god, I've gained seven pounds."
S05E07,JERRY,I've gained eight.
S05E07,KRAMER,I told ya.
S05E07,ELAINE,"Oh, my god! A couple, but 7 pounds. How did I gain 7 pounds?"
S05E07,JERRY,How did I gain eight?
S05E07,ELAINE,"I don't get it. I, I've been doing the same exercises. I haven't been eating anything different."
S05E07,JERRY,"Me, either. Wait a second. Wait a second. Maybe it's that yogurt."
S05E07,KRAMER,"No, no, no. That's hundred percent non-fat."
S05E07,JERRY,"Well, how else could this have happened?"
S05E07,KRAMER,"Well, maybe it's the Oreos."
S05E07,ELAINE,I don't eat Oreos.
S05E07,KRAMER,You don't eat Oreos? (acts out eating Oreos) The way you break them open? You're (does a bunch of licking motions) ~ practically having sex with them.
S05E07,JERRY,What about me?
S05E07,KRAMER,You? You're getting old.
S05E07,JERRY,Maybe your yogurt isn't so non-fat.
S05E07,KRAMER,"Oh, guess again, Tubby!"
S05E07,ELAINE,"Jerry, there's got to be a way to find that out."
S05E07,JERRY,There must be some kind of lab that would do that kind of thing.
S05E07,ELAINE,AH! I've got it.
S05E07,KRAMER,What?
S05E07,ELAINE,I'll call the Food and Drug Administration.
S05E07,KRAMER,"Hey, I'll tell you what, Chubs, if that yogurt has fat in it, I will put myself on an all-yogurt diet for a week."
S05E07,JERRY,"Well, let's start the insanity."
S05E07,KRAMER,NNNN-Giddy-up!
S05E07,FRANK,Tommy Tune is a very good dancer. (hits George on the head with what seems to be the tvguide) You ever see Tommy Tune dance?
S05E07,GEORGE,No.
S05E07,ESTELLE,I like tap dancing.
S05E07,FRANK,Tap dancing. Anyone can tap dance. It's all in those shoes.
S05E07,ESTELLE,"Are you kidding? They practice for years, those people."
S05E07,GEORGE,What's for supper?
S05E07,ESTELLE,Somebody's at the door.
S05E07,FRANK,Tommy Tune is very tall. That helps. It makes him lankier.
S05E07,ESTELLE,(answers the door) Lloyd?
S05E07,LLOYD,"Hello, Mrs. Costanza."
S05E07,ESTELLE,"Georgie, Lloyd Braun is here."
S05E07,FRANK,Hey! Lloyd!
S05E07,ESTELLE,What are you doing here?
S05E07,LLOYD,"Well, I was just in the neighborhood visiting my mother so I thought I'd drop by and say, ""Hello""."
S05E07,ESTELLE,Georgie. Come here and say hello.
S05E07,FRANK,"How are you doing, Lloyd? I hear you're a big advisor for Dinkins now."
S05E07,LLOYD,"That's right. Hey, George."
S05E07,GEORGE,"Hey, Lloyd. (Shakes hands with Lloyd) How's it going? (chuckles)"
S05E07,LLOYD,I uh ran into George yesterday in the city.
S05E07,ESTELLE,Ow! (hits George on the forehead) What's the matter with you?
S05E07,LLOYD,"So, uh, how's the arm, huh?"
S05E07,GEORGE,"Oh, it's good."
S05E07,ESTELLE,What's the matter with your arm?
S05E07,GEORGE,Nothing.
S05E07,LLOYD,"Oh, his arm moves like this. (does the nudging motion)"
S05E07,FRANK,Your arm moves like this? (does the nudging motion)
S05E07,GEORGE,Yeah.
S05E07,FRANK,(continues to move his arm) I never seen your arm move like this.
S05E07,ESTELLE,"Me, either."
S05E07,GEORGE,"Well, it comes and goes."
S05E07,FRANK,It's like some kind of aaaaa (snapping his fingers) spasm.
S05E07,LLOYD,"Ooh! I asked Mr. Dinkins if he knew any good orthopedists, and he said he had the best. (hands George the Doctor's card) So, I made an appointment for you. Dr. Dekter."
S05E07,ESTELLE,Mayor Dinkins got an appointment for him?
S05E07,FRANK,You mentioned George's name to Mayor Dinkins? You discussed George with the mayor of New York?
S05E07,ESTELLE,Dinkins was talking about you. He was discussing you.
S05E07,GEORGE,"You know, Lloyd, I-I've been to the doctor (hands George the card) there's really nothing they can do."
S05E07,FRANK,"(grabbing the card) Hey, Mayor Dinkins set this up for you. You know what kind of a doctor this must be if Dinkins knows him?"
S05E07,GEORGE,All right. All right! I'll go.
S05E07,LLOYD,"Well, that's great. (grabs the card back from Frank and hands it to George again) And, uh, I'll be very interested to hear the diagnosis."
S05E07,ELAINE,"Uh-huh. Okay, well, we're coming down. All right. (hangs up the phone) Okay. I got a place that can analyze it. It's in Brooklyn. We have to drive there."
S05E07,JERRY,And they said they can do it?
S05E07,ELAINE,"Yeah, it's forty-five bucks."
S05E07,JERRY,"All right. Let's go down to the yogurt store, and we'll get a specimen."
S05E07,ELAINE,Hm-hmm.
S05E07,MARYEDITH,"Well, I hope you're satisfied."
S05E07,JERRY,What?
S05E07,MARYEDITH,"Every word out of my son's mouth now is *beep*(fuck), *beep*(fuck), *beep*(fuck). (Jerry half turns and puts his head done for a second) You know what he said to me five minutes ago? Where's my *beep*(fuck)ing cupcake?"
S05E07,JERRY,"Gee, I'm really sorry."
S05E07,MARYEDITH,He wants to be like you because you're a comedian. Maybe you could talk to him?
S05E07,JERRY,I'd be happy to.
S05E07,MARYEDITH,Thank you.
S05E07,JERRY,"Ah, Mary, we've been eating a lot of your husband's uh yogurt at the yogurt place - does that have any fat in it?"
S05E07,MARYEDITH,No *beep*(fuck)ing way!
S05E07,LLOYD,"Well, it was very nice seeing you again."
S05E07,ESTELLE,"Oh, it was good seeing you."
S05E07,LLOYD,"Oh, um, by the way, who was that gorgeous woman I saw you with the other day?"
S05E07,GEORGE,"Oh, uh, just a friend of mine."
S05E07,ESTELLE,You must mean Elaine. Isn't she adorable?
S05E07,LLOYD,She is. She is. How about giving me her number?
S05E07,GEORGE,"Oh, you know, Lloyd, I really don't have it."
S05E07,ESTELLE,She works at Pendant Publishing. Elaine Benes.
S05E07,LLOYD,"Oh, great. (nudges George on the chin) Thanks a lot!"
S05E07,GEORGE,Yeah!
S05E07,LLOYD,Buh bye.
S05E07,ESTELLE,"Bye! (Lloyd leaves) Oh, that Lloyd Braun. He is something, isn't he?"
S05E07,NEWMAN,"Well, I wouldn't hear of it. I said, ""Nice try, granny!"" And I sent her to the back of the line!"
S05E07,JERRY,"Hello, Newman."
S05E07,NEWMAN,"Hello, Jerry. Say, this yogurt is really something, huh? And it's non-fat! I've been waiting for something like this my whole life! And it's finally here!"
S05E07,OWNER,"Hey, Seinfeld. I'd appreciate it if you'd stop using obscenities around my son, huh?"
S05E07,JERRY,It was an accident. I'm going to talk to him.
S05E07,ELAINE,"I want a small, plain vanilla in a cup to go. That's non-fat, right?"
S05E07,OWNER,That's right.
S05E07,ELAINE,"'Cause I'm on a special diet, and the doctor said I can't have any fat."
S05E07,OWNER,"Yeah, well, there is no fat."
S05E07,NEWMAN,"Hey, another round of strawberry for me and my friends."
S05E07,ELAINE,"Hurry, Jerry! Hurry!"
S05E07,JERRY,How's it doing?
S05E07,ELAINE,Not so good.
S05E07,KRAMER,"Well, you can't have this tested now. It's melting."
S05E07,JERRY,So what.
S05E07,KRAMER,It changes the molecules.
S05E07,JERRY,"Oh, you don't know what you're talking about."
S05E07,KRAMER,"Hey, fatso! I got a 90 in biology."
S05E07,JERRY,You call me fatso one more time; you're going to be walking back.
S05E07,ELAINE,"Um, hi! Hi. I called earlier about getting the yogurt tested."
S05E07,LAB TECHNICIAN,"Oh, right. Would you fill this out, please?"
S05E07,ELAINE,"Uh, does it matter if it's melted?"
S05E07,LAB TECHNICIAN,"No! (Jerry looks at Kramer) You know, this is going to take a couple of days."
S05E07,ELAINE,That's okay.
S05E07,KRAMER,"Hello, there."
S05E07,CHERYL,Hello!
S05E07,KRAMER,Ooh! Test tubes. Cool!
S05E07,JERRY,What do you got there?
S05E07,LAB TECHNICIAN,"Actually, this is Mr. Giuliani's blood. We're doing a cholesterol work up on it."
S05E07,JERRY,Oh.
S05E07,ELAINE,"Okay, I'm done."
S05E07,CHERYL,It was really nice meeting you.
S05E07,KRAMER,"Well, the pleasure's all mine."
S05E07,JERRY,You can't take that chemist out.
S05E07,KRAMER,Why not?
S05E07,JERRY,Because she's like the jury. She's going to be sequestered.
S05E07,KRAMER,I'm not taking her out just to influence the results.
S05E07,JERRY,"Well, I think the whole thing stinks."
S05E07,ELAINE,It smells. Smells bad. Smells really bad.
S05E07,JERRY,That's enough.
S05E07,ELAINE,What?
S05E07,JERRY,With the smelling.
S05E07,GEORGE,"So, he made an appointment for me to see Dinkins' doctor. He's just trying to humiliate me."
S05E07,JERRY,Uh-huh.
S05E07,GEORGE,"And I have to go. If I don't go, he'll know I'm lying."
S05E07,JERRY,"Well, so, what are you going to do? Sit in the doctor's office doing this? (moves his arm) He's gonna think you're a mental patient."
S05E07,GEORGE,"I don't care. Look, Lloyd doesn't know what he's up against. This is nothing to me. (moving his arm) My whole life is a lie."
S05E07,ELAINE,Hey!
S05E07,GEORGE,Hey
S05E07,JERRY,Hey.
S05E07,ELAINE,"So, guess who called me."
S05E07,GEORGE,"Oh, don't tell me. Lloyd?"
S05E07,ELAINE,We're going out tomorrow night.
S05E07,GEORGE,"Oh, look, he's going to ask you about my arm. So, just tell him I banged it against a desk. And it's been moving involuntarily ever since."
S05E07,ELAINE,I can't say that.
S05E07,GEORGE,Why not?
S05E07,ELAINE,What if I like him? I'm going to start out lying to this guy?
S05E07,GEORGE,"So, you're taking his side?"
S05E07,ELAINE,No. But what if we get married or something? We'll always have that between us.
S05E07,GEORGE,Already you're marrying this guy?
S05E07,ELAINE,You never know.
S05E07,GEORGE,"All right, believe me, you're not going to marry him."
S05E07,ELAINE,"All right, well, then what if we become a couple, George? Every time we see you you're going to be walking around going like this? (moving her arm) Even you can't keep that up."
S05E07,JERRY,"No, I believe he can."
S05E07,MARYEDITH,Hi!
S05E07,JERRY,Hi!
S05E07,MARYEDITH,You know Jerry.
S05E07,MATTHEW,"Of course, he's the funny *beep*(fuck)."
S05E07,MARYEDITH,See!
S05E07,JERRY,"Listen, Matthew, I-I want to explain something to you. Now, cursing is not something that most comedians do."
S05E07,MATTHEW,You did it.
S05E07,JERRY,"That's true. But it was an accident. And I haven't done it since. And I would never do it again. And if you continue cursing, you'll never become a comedian like me when you grow up. (phone rings) Excuse me one second."
S05E07,ELAINE,"You know, Lloyd advises Dinkins on everything he does."
S05E07,GEORGE,"Yeah, yeah. Big advisor."
S05E07,ELAINE,He tells him which soap to use.
S05E07,JERRY,(quickly moves over toward Matthew) What the *beep*(fuck) are you doing? You little piece of *beep*(shit)!
S05E07,CHERYL,Shh! We don't want to disturb the security guard.
S05E07,KRAMER,Where's the lights. Whoa!
S05E07,CHERYL,How about this?
S05E07,KRAMER,Yeah! Bunsen burner. (runs his fingers through the flame) oo ya ya.
S05E07,CHERYL,Oo.
S05E07,KRAMER,Yaow.
S05E07,CHERYL,Ha hea.
S05E07,KRAMER,You want a taste? It's Cappuccino.
S05E07,CHERYL,It's delicious.
S05E07,KRAMER,I hear you.
S05E07,CHERYL,Non-fat?
S05E07,KRAMER,"Well, you tell me. Is the verdict in yet?"
S05E07,CHERYL,No.
S05E07,KRAMER,"Well, this is in case there's a tie!"
S05E07,ELAINE,"Well, as far as I know, he bumped his arm into a door and it's kind of got this in(pauses)voluntarily movement. Some sort of a (clears her throat) spasm. So, anyway, you're a..you're a big advisor to Dinkins, huh?"
S05E07,LLOYD,"Yeah, yeah. It's coming right down to the wire."
S05E07,ELAINE,Wow! You know what I would do if I was running for mayor. One of my campaign themes would be that everybody should wear name tags all the time to make the city friendlier.
S05E07,LLOYD,"Name tags, hmm?"
S05E07,ELAINE,"Well, everybody would know everybody. It would be like a small town."
S05E07,LLOYD,Maybe I'll mention that to him.
S05E07,ELAINE,Really? Wow.
S05E07,LLOYD,You sure you don't want any yogurt?
S05E07,ELAINE,"No, I'm watching my weight."
S05E07,LLOYD,"Well, it's non-fat."
S05E07,ELAINE,"Yeah, so they say."
S05E07,LLOYD,"Well I'm done, should we go?"
S05E07,ELAINE,Yeah. Okay.
S05E07,ELAINE,"Three days and he hasn't called me, and you know why? Because he thinks I'm too fat."
S05E07,JERRY,(surprised) He said that?
S05E07,ELAINE,"(stands up straight) No, but I saw the look on his face when he put his arm around me. And then we went to his apartment, and I sat on one of his chairs and it broke. And he says, ""Boy, you're a lot of woman!"""
S05E07,KRAMER,"Hey! So, hear anything on the yogurt?"
S05E07,JERRY,"No, but I expect to hear anytime."
S05E07,KRAMER,"Well, I wouldn't get your hopes up."
S05E07,JERRY,Why do you say that?
S05E07,KRAMER,"No reason. Oh, did you hear about that Dinkins?"
S05E07,ELAINE,No. What about him?
S05E07,KRAMER,You didn't hear?
S05E07,ELAINE,Un-huh.
S05E07,KRAMER,He's proposing a plan where everyone in the city should wear name tags.
S05E07,JERRY,Name tags?
S05E07,KRAMER,"Yeah! So people can go around saying ""hello"" to one another."
S05E07,JERRY,"Oh, I see. So you can go, ""Hey, you know who I saw wilding today? Herb!"""
S05E07,KRAMER,He's become the laughing stock! You know The Times has already stated it could cost him the election. (laughing) Name tags!
S05E07,JERRY,"(on the phone) Hello? Yes. Uh-huh. Ya. Oh, really? Okay, thank you very much. Bye-bye. (hangs up the phone) Well, the yogurt verdict is in. (Kramer looks at Jerry with his arms out) Fat!"
S05E07,KRAMER,Yeow!
S05E07,GEORGE,"The next morning, I woke up, and it was going like this. (moves his arm slowly) I can control it if I really concentrate. But otherwise, (arm moves) oh."
S05E07,DOCTOR,"Uh huh. Yes, well, I'm going to have to be perfectly honest with you."
S05E07,GEORGE,"Please, doctor."
S05E07,DOCTOR,I've examined you.
S05E07,GEORGE,Yes.
S05E07,DOCTOR,I've looked at your X-rays.
S05E07,GEORGE,Uh-huh.
S05E07,DOCTOR,And I find that there's absolutely nothing wrong with you.
S05E07,GEORGE,Hmm. Really? Nothing?
S05E07,DOCTOR,"Nothing, that would indicate involuntary spasms."
S05E07,GEORGE,"Well, it's kind of a mystery, isn't it?"
S05E07,DOCTOR,"No, not really."
S05E07,GEORGE,How so?
S05E07,DOCTOR,May I suggest the possibility that you're faking?
S05E07,GEORGE,"Faking? What makes you think that I have time to see doctors, take X-rays, make appointments, when there's absolutely nothing wrong with me? What kind of a person would do a thing like that?"
S05E07,DOCTOR,I don't know what kind of a person would do something like that. Obviously a very sick person. A very immature person. A person who has no regard for wasting other people's valuable time. Good-bye.
S05E07,GEORGE,"Now, see here, doctor."
S05E07,DOCTOR,"I said, good-bye."
S05E07,GEORGE,Fine. (hits his arm on the desk) Ow!
S05E07,ELAINE,"Jerry, come on, look. Let's go over to that yogurt store."
S05E07,JERRY,"Look, Elaine, I've been thinking about this. This has got to be a massive conspiracy. Who knows how deep it goes. Hey, look, wait a second, (looking at the TV) Kramer, turn that up."
S05E07,KRAMER,"Huh, Okay."
S05E07,NEWS,"Rudy Giuliani, who underwent a physical last week, received some startling news today, when his cholesterol count turned out to be a whopping 375. What effect this will have on the minds of the voters remains to be seen. In another development, Mayor Dinkins has fired his top advisor, Lloyd Braun, who is believed to be responsible for the name tag fiasco. We now take you to Giuliani headquarters where Rudy Giuliani is about to make a statement."
S05E07,GIULIANI,"It's hard to understand. Because I've been doing everything I normally do. I've been watching my diet very carefully. I exercise regularly. My only indulgence, I guess, would be that I eat a lot of frozen yogurt. But it's non-fat."
S05E07,JERRY,"Non-fat yogurt? Oh, my god. They got Giuliani and he doesn't even know it."
S05E07,ELAINE,(pointing to Kramer) Now look what you've done.
S05E07,JERRY,"Well, we've got to do something. (grabs his phone) I'm calling Giuliani's headquarters."
S05E07,GEORGE,Name tags! Name tags! What kind of an idiot thinks anybody would be interested in an idea like that.
S05E07,FRANK,"I don't think it's so bad. People should wear name tags. Everyone would be a lot friendlier. ""Hello, Sam."" ""How are you doing, Joe?"" (George's arm moves and hits the lamp) Hey, your arm. It moved again. I thought you said it went away."
S05E07,GEORGE,I banged it on the desk in the doctor's office. An (worriedly rubbing his arm) aaaa . . .
S05E07,ESTELLE,Be quiet. They're starting the press conference.
S05E07,GIULIANI,"My campaign staff has received some very disturbing information regarding the fat content in yogurt that's being sold throughout the city. I pledge to you now, that if I'm elected mayor, as my first order of business I'll appoint a special task force to investigate this matter. I promise you, my fellow New Yorkers, that Mayor Giuliani will do everything possible to cleanse this city of this falsified non-fat yogurt."
S05E07,JERRY,"The old yogurt was so much better. Oh, this is terrible."
S05E07,GEORGE,Phew!
S05E07,ELAINE,"Oh, it stinks."
S05E07,KRAMER,"Mine, too. I got one more day."
S05E07,JERRY,I can't eat this.
S05E07,NEWMAN,"(from the corner of the Yogurt shop) Hey, Jerry. Thanks a lot. I hope you're happy."
S05E07,JERRY,"It had fat in it, it's not good for you."
S05E07,NEWMAN,"I don't care. It was good. I was enjoying it. Had to interfere. Couldn't leave well enough alone. Well, I will get even with you for this. You can count on it."
S05E07,ELAINE,"Hey, you guys, listen to this. Listen to this. (reading from the newspaper) Apparently some blood spilled into Mr. Giuliani's test tube causing his cholesterol count to be 150 points higher than was initially reported. Ironically, the mishap by bringing the non-fat yogurt scandal to the attention of the public, probably clinched the election for the Republican. It was the one issue which seemed to electrify the voters and swept Giuliani into office."
S05E07,JERRY,"So, in effect, the yogurt won him the election."
S05E07,ELAINE,I wonder what actually happened in that lab.
S05E07,KRAMER,"Yeah, me, too."
S05E07,NEWMAN,I can't eat this.
S05E07,MATTHEW,"(hits Jerry to get his attention) Thanks for ruining my daddy's business, you fat *beep*(fuck)."
S05E08,JERRY,"The old-fashioned barber shop is unfortunately becoming a thing of the past, now what went wrong? Well first of all there's a twenty thousand dollar chair to make a three dollar tip. I say cut back on the chair, update the magazines. Why do barbers always display that license? There's no laws in hair cutting, except show every person the back of their head that's the one law. I don't want to see the back of my head. Why do I want to see something that I'm never going to see at any other time? When I buy pants two salesmen don't lift me up by the legs and go ""how do you like crotch?"" If I wanted to see everything I would have been a fly."
S05E08,MR. TUTTLE,Well George we here at Sanalac like to think of ourselves as a fairly progressive company. We have a small but prestigious group of clients.
S05E08,GEORGE,Well a lot of people consider me small and prestigious.
S05E08,MR. TUTTLE,"That's funny George. You're very quick. I feel like I, like I don't have to explain every little thing to you. You understand everything immediately."
S05E08,GEORGE,I enjoy understanding.
S05E08,MR. TUTTLE,I want you to have this job. Of course...
S05E08,SECRETARY,Mr. Zimmer is on line 2.
S05E08,MR. TUTTLE,"Thanks. I've got to take this call. Listen, I'm really glad that you came in."
S05E08,GEORGE,I want you to have this job. Of course...
S05E08,JERRY & ELAINE,Yeah?
S05E08,GEORGE,That's it.
S05E08,JERRY,What do you mean that's it?
S05E08,GEORGE,"He never finished the sentence. He got a call, that was the end of the interview."
S05E08,JERRY,"""Of course"" was the last thing he said?"
S05E08,GEORGE,"Maybe he was going to say ""Of course I have to check with my associates."""
S05E08,ELAINE,"""I want you to have this job, of course the Board of Directors is under indictment and will be serving time."""
S05E08,JERRY,"""I want you to have this job, of course sodomy is a prerequisite."""
S05E08,GEORGE,All right.
S05E08,ELAINE,Why don't you go ahead and call him?
S05E08,GEORGE,Because he made a big deal about how I understand everything immediately. That's what impressed him.
S05E08,JERRY,"So if you call and ask if you have the job, you might lose the job."
S05E08,GEORGE,And if I don't call...
S05E08,JERRY,"You might have the job, but you'll never know it. What kind of company is it?"
S05E08,GEORGE,Rest stop supply.
S05E08,ELAINE & JERRY,Oh.
S05E08,ELAINE,Good for you.
S05E08,KRAMER,"Yeah, yeah, yeah."
S05E08,GEORGE,Hey
S05E08,JERRY,Hey
S05E08,KRAMER,Hey.
S05E08,JERRY,Shower?
S05E08,KRAMER,Haircut.
S05E08,JERRY,Oh.
S05E08,KRAMER,I'm very happy with this.
S05E08,JERRY,Who'd you use? Gino?
S05E08,KRAMER,Oh course. I wouldn't let that other butcher cut my hair.
S05E08,ELAINE,What butcher?
S05E08,KRAMER,The uncle Enzo. That's the guy Jerry uses.
S05E08,JERRY,Well I've been going with him for 12 years. I can't switch. I'd hurt his feelings.
S05E08,ELAINE,You never get good haircuts.
S05E08,KRAMER,You can get a good one today. It's Enzo's day off. Gino's there all by himself.
S05E08,JERRY,Really?
S05E08,ELAINE,"Yeah. You know what, you should go over there and get one to look good for my bachelor auction."
S05E08,KRAMER,What bachelor auction?
S05E08,ELAINE,Oh it's a thing where they auction off dates with bachelors for charity.
S05E08,KRAMER,And you didn't ask me to do it? I could raise enough money to cure polio.
S05E08,JERRY,I believe they've had a cure for polio for quite some time.
S05E08,KRAMER,Polio?
S05E08,ELAINE,Will you go ahead? You need a haircut.
S05E08,JERRY,Okay.
S05E08,KRAMER,What are you all dressed up for?
S05E08,GEORGE,I had a job interview.
S05E08,KRAMER,Yeah. How'd it go?
S05E08,GEORGE,Good. Of course...
S05E08,ENZO,Oh Jerry.
S05E08,JERRY,Oh hi Enzo.
S05E08,ENZO,"Oh, you've come for the haircut."
S05E08,JERRY,"No, actually I was just gonna..."
S05E08,ENZO,"It's my day off, but I take care of you anyway because you're my favorite customer. You've been with me for so long. You're so loyal."
S05E08,JERRY,"Well I, if it's your day off I really... (tries to leave)"
S05E08,ENZO,"(He pulls Jerry into the barber chair. Jerry is trying to get away but can't.) Eh, what's the difference. It takes 10 minutes. Jerry, today I'm going to do something special for you."
S05E08,JERRY,Well I don't want to take too much off.
S05E08,ENZO,"Hey who's your barber, eh? You tell the joke, I cut the hair."
S05E08,MAN,"Gino, you've outdone yourself this time. This is the best haircut I've ever had."
S05E08,GEORGE,He massacred you.
S05E08,JERRY,I know.
S05E08,GEORGE,You look like you're five years old.
S05E08,JERRY,What if I shampoo? Sometimes a shampoo helps.
S05E08,GEORGE,You've got to start seeing someone else. Get out of this relationship.
S05E08,JERRY,I can't. He loves me. He says I'm his most loyal customer. Plus he's right there on the corner. I'd have to pass him every day when I go by.
S05E08,GEORGE,"Well, you gotta do it."
S05E08,JERRY,"I can't, I can't. I'd break his heart."
S05E08,KRAMER,No way my Gino did that. It's an Enzo.
S05E08,JERRY,He was in the shop. I thought you told me he wasn't going to be there.
S05E08,KRAMER,So what?
S05E08,JERRY,I didn't want to hurt his feelings.
S05E08,KRAMER,His feelings? You can't continue seeing him. You're destroying yourself.
S05E08,JERRY,Yea but...
S05E08,KRAMER,I'm not going to let you. If you don't call him I will.
S05E08,JERRY,"No, no Kramer. I don't want you to do that. You can't do that."
S05E08,KRAMER,"I'm going to call Gino, you're going to see him, and we're going to get that haircut fixed up."
S05E08,JERRY,I don't want you to call him.
S05E08,KRAMER,"All right, geez. You're crazy."
S05E08,GEORGE,So I still haven't heard about that job.
S05E08,JERRY,Yeah that's a tough one. What are you going to do about that?
S05E08,GEORGE,I have an idea.
S05E08,JERRY,Yeah?
S05E08,GEORGE,I show up.
S05E08,JERRY,What do you mean you show up?
S05E08,GEORGE,"I show up. I pretend I have the job. The guy's on vacation. If I have the job, it's fine. If I don't have the job, by the time he comes back, I'm ensconced."
S05E08,JERRY,Hmm. Not bad.
S05E08,GEORGE,What's the worst thing that could happen?
S05E08,JERRY,"Well, you'd be embarrassed and humiliated in front of a large group of people and have to walk out in shame with your tail between your legs."
S05E08,GEORGE,"Yeah, so?"
S05E08,JERRY,"Yeah, I see what you mean. I forgot who I was dealing with here."
S05E08,GEORGE,(to various people as he walks in) Good morning. Good morning. Good morning. Hi nice to see you. How are you. Good morning. (to the secretary) Good morning.
S05E08,SECRETARY,How can I help you?
S05E08,GEORGE,The name's George Constanza. I'm starting work here today. I was wondering if you could tell me where my office is.
S05E08,SECRETARY,"I wasn't aware that, uh, Mike, this is George Constanza. He's starting here today."
S05E08,MIKE,Welcome aboard.
S05E08,GEORGE,Thanks Mike. Nice to be aboard.
S05E08,MIKE,I wasn't aware that Mr. Tuttle was finished interviewing.
S05E08,GEORGE,"Oh, well, he was probably just getting anxious to start his vacation."
S05E08,SECRETARY,He wants to know where his office is.
S05E08,MIKE,"Oh, ah, let's see, we've got two. There's a big one down the hall there and a small one over here. You know I should ask Jack."
S05E08,GEORGE,Oh leave Jack alone. Jack's got enough problems. I'll just take the small office.
S05E08,MIKE,Really?
S05E08,GEORGE,"Yes. I like to feel cozy. I have a very small apartment. I like to feel tucked in, nestled in. Love to be nestled."
S05E08,MIKE,"All right, it's 808 right down there. Meanwhile, I'll get you the Pensky file, you can start working on that."
S05E08,GEORGE,"Yes, yes of course. The Pensky file. Ho ho, can't wait to sink my teeth into that. Wow that Pensky. Well we'll straighten him out."
S05E08,(Camera shot at the clock on his wall. The clock says 9,00.)
S05E08,"(A moment later, the clock flips to 5",00.)
S05E08,JERRY,So what did you do there all day?
S05E08,GEORGE,They gave me the Pensky file.
S05E08,JERRY,So it's a nice place to work?
S05E08,GEORGE,You know I'm enjoying it very much. I think my coworkers are really taking to me.
S05E08,GEORGE,"(continuing) I feel like a family. In fact, yesterday was Grace's birthday. She's such a sweet woman so, we had a little party, with cake and champagne. I made a toast."
S05E08,JERRY,What about your boss? The guys you interviewed you?
S05E08,GEORGE,He'll be back on Monday.
S05E08,JERRY,Hi.
S05E08,ELAINE,Hi. How come you're wearing a hat?
S05E08,JERRY,I got a haircut.
S05E08,ELAINE,Oh yeah? Can I see it?
S05E08,JERRY,Oh there's nothing to see.
S05E08,ELAINE,Come on. Let me see it.
S05E08,JERRY,Forget it.
S05E08,ELAINE,Come on.
S05E08,JERRY,All right.
S05E08,JERRY,"Alright, that's very good. Thank you."
S05E08,ELAINE,"(still laughing, tears in her eyes) I'm sorry. I'm so sorry."
S05E08,JERRY,"Well I'll tell you this, you can forget about me going to that bachelor auction."
S05E08,ELAINE,"What? No Jerry, you have to go."
S05E08,GEORGE,"You know Elaine, I'd do it but I'm working that day."
S05E08,ELAINE,"(dryly) Yeah, too bad."
S05E08,KRAMER,It the worst haircut Jerry's ever had. You gotta fix it.
S05E08,GINO,"Sure, I fix. But you gotta make sure you no tell anybody. He's a little crazy. I don't know what he'd do if he found out I touch Jerry's hair."
S05E08,KRAMER,Yeah yeah yeah.
S05E08,GINO,(Enzo enters) So I love the Edward Scissorhands. That's the best movie I've ever seen.
S05E08,ENZO,"Oh ah, again with the Edward Scissorhand. How can you have hand like a scissor, huh? Show me one person who's got hand like a scissor."
S05E08,GINO,"Hey, it's a beautiful dream. I'd love to be this man."
S05E08,ENZO,Did you ever think about what you're going to do on the toilet? (yelling) What are you going to do on the toilet?
S05E08,KRAMER,I'd like to have shoehorn hands.
S05E08,KRAMER,Hey.
S05E08,JERRY,Hey
S05E08,KRAMER,"Okay listen to me. I talked to Gino, he's going to fix the haircut."
S05E08,ELAINE,"Oh great, then you can go to the bachelor auction."
S05E08,JERRY,"Yeah, but how am I..."
S05E08,KRAMER,"No buts. His apartment tonight, Eight o'clock."
S05E08,ELAINE,Can he fix it?
S05E08,KRAMER,I don't know.
S05E08,GINO,"Boy, you've got a beautiful head of hair."
S05E08,JERRY,Oh. thank you.
S05E08,GINO,"I bet uncle Enzo, he tell you that all the time."
S05E08,JERRY,Well actually Enzo hasn't said that to me in a while.
S05E08,GINO,I don't think Uncle Enzo realize what a lucky barber he is.
S05E08,JERRY,That's nice of you to say.
S05E08,GINO,Just a second. (answering buzzer) Yes.
S05E08,ENZO,(over the speaker) It's your uncle Enzo.
S05E08,GINO,It's Uncle Enzo. Go in there. I'll clean up.
S05E08,GINO,"Uncle Enzo, what are you doing here?"
S05E08,ENZO,I've come to apologize.
S05E08,GINO,Apologize?
S05E08,ENZO,"Yea. I rented the move Edward Scissorhands. That Johnny Depp, he make me cry."
S05E08,GINO,He make me cry too. You want something to drink?
S05E08,ENZO,"Hey, what's all of this?"
S05E08,GINO,Nothing. It's just hair.
S05E08,ENZO,You do haircut in the apartment?
S05E08,GINO,No. Pizza man was here. Maybe some fall off. He's going bald.
S05E08,ENZO,It looks very familiar.
S05E08,JERRY,In the one minute he worked on me I could tell he was really good.
S05E08,KRAMER,"Yeah. Slow, gentle, attentive."
S05E08,JERRY,Yeah.
S05E08,KRAMER,I told you he could do it.
S05E08,JERRY,Enzo picked up one of my hairs off the floor.
S05E08,KRAMER,"Yeah, so?"
S05E08,JERRY,I think he knew.
S05E08,KRAMER,No. He doesn't know.
S05E08,JERRY,Who do you know? He knows my hair.
S05E08,KRAMER,Listen you're just imagining things. He doesn't know a thing. Now come on. Pull yourself together.
S05E08,JERRY,"Okay, okay."
S05E08,ELAINE,What happened? It looks the same.
S05E08,JERRY,He didn't get to finish it. His uncle came in. We almost got caught.
S05E08,ELAINE,"Jerry, the auction is in a few hours."
S05E08,JERRY,Take the K-man.
S05E08,ELAINE,You can still go.
S05E08,KRAMER,What are you kidding? Look at him. He's grotesque.
S05E08,ELAINE,You think?
S05E08,KRAMER,Do I think? He's repugnant.
S05E08,ELAINE,What would you wear?
S05E08,KRAMER,Whatever it takes.
S05E08,ENZO,"See, now Newman is a good customer."
S05E08,NEWMAN,Once I find a barber I stick with him. I almost went to barber school. I always felt I had a talent for it.
S05E08,ENZO,"Oh, not everybody like Newman, so loyal."
S05E08,NEWMAN,"Yeah, just the way that I was raised. I'm special."
S05E08,ENZO,"You know I don't mind if somebody's funny, but I no like the funny business."
S05E08,GINO,I'm going to go out for a little bit. I'll be right back.
S05E08,ENZO,Take your time. (Gino leaves) You happy with the haircut?
S05E08,NEWMAN,It's okay. A little crooked.
S05E08,ENZO,How'd you like to have free haircut for six months.
S05E08,NEWMAN,What's the catch?
S05E08,ENZO,You're going to get me a sample of Jerry's hair.
S05E08,NEWMAN,"Hmm, that job sounds like it might be worth a year's free haircuts. And a comb."
S05E08,SECRETARY,"(over the speaker) Mr. Costanza, Mr. Pensky is here to see you."
S05E08,GEORGE,Mr. Pensky? Of the Pensky file?
S05E08,PENSKY,Costanza? Arthur Pensky.
S05E08,GEORGE,Mr. Pensky. I was just working on your file. I was transferring the contents of the file into this flexible accordion-style folder.
S05E08,PENSKY,Where's Tuttle?
S05E08,GEORGE,He's on vacation.
S05E08,PENSKY,He was on vacation the last time I dropped by. Give me my file. (looks through the file) Looks like you put a lot of work into this.
S05E08,GEORGE,Well you know in college they used to call me the little bulldog.
S05E08,PENSKY,"Hey, you are Pensky material. Would you ever consider coming to work directly for me?"
S05E08,GEORGE,Really?
S05E08,PENSKY,You are aware...
S05E08,SECRETARY,(over the speaker) Mr. Castanza?
S05E08,GEORGE,Not now Florice.
S05E08,SECRETARY,(speaker) I thought Mr. Pensky should know they're towing his car.
S05E08,PENSKY,Damn this city.
S05E08,GEORGE,I am aware. I am aware.
S05E08,GINO,He knows. He knows about us.
S05E08,JERRY,How do you know?
S05E08,GINO,"Because I know. He's crazy. All morning, he looking at the hair. He staring at the hair."
S05E08,JERRY,Who is it?
S05E08,NEWMAN,It's Newman.
S05E08,GINO,He was in the shop with Enzo. He can't see me here.
S05E08,JERRY,"All right, go in the bedroom. Open the window. You can go out the fire escape."
S05E08,JERRY,What do you want?
S05E08,NEWMAN,(dancing) Can I use your bathroom?
S05E08,JERRY,What's wrong with yours?
S05E08,NEWMAN,My toilet's clogged.
S05E08,JERRY,You can't unclog it?
S05E08,NEWMAN,No.
S05E08,JERRY,Did you ask Kramer?
S05E08,NEWMAN,He's out.
S05E08,JERRY,Number one?
S05E08,NEWMAN,"Yes, yes. May I go? Cause I gotta go very badly."
S05E08,JERRY,All right. Flush twice.
S05E08,NEWMAN,(thinking to himself; checks a comb) No. (checks a brush) Jackpot. I don't believe this. There's no hair in this thing. I've never seen a person that didn't have at least one hair in a brush.
S05E08,JERRY,All right?
S05E08,NEWMAN,"Yeah, yeah."
S05E08,JERRY,"All right, I'll see you later."
S05E08,NEWMAN,What are you doing?
S05E08,JERRY,I'm watching Edward Scissorhands.
S05E08,NEWMAN,"Oh, can I watch a little? Cuz it's my favorite movie."
S05E08,JERRY,Yeah all right.
S05E08,JERRY,You want something to drink?
S05E08,NEWMAN,No. No.
S05E08,JERRY,"If you want to watch, sit down. You're making me nervous. I tell you this Scissorhands is a hell of a barber."
S05E08,NEWMAN,"Gotta go. Oh gee, I dropped a nickel (reaches down and picks up the hair.)"
S05E08,ENZO,Did you get it? (comparing the hairs) Oh you done good Newman.
S05E08,NEWMAN,It was a cinch. Where are you going?
S05E08,ENZO,Io volgio vandetta.
S05E08,ELAINE,"Nine hundred. Do I hear a thousand? Ladies, he is a Harvard graduate."
S05E08,WOMAN,A thousand.
S05E08,ELAINE,"A thousand. Okay, a thousand once, a thousand twice, a thousand three times, sold to the lucky lady in the third row. Congratulations, thank you so much."
S05E08,ELAINE,"Okay next bachelor is number, um 124 on your program. He's uh, he's a high school graduate."
S05E08,KRAMER,Equivalency.
S05E08,ELAINE,"Oh, uh equivalency. A high school equivalency program graduate. (Kramer dances up and down the stage) He's uh, self-employed. He's... I don't know, six foot three, 190 pounds, he likes, uh... fruit, and he just got uh, a haircut."
S05E08,ELAINE,"Oh, Kramer. Okay uh, why don't we start the bidding. Do I hear, um, five bucks?"
S05E08,JERRY,"I don't get this Scissorhands. What, is he supposed to be like a super hero, like Green Lantern or somebody? What's with this guy? (Gino looks at him annoyed) Just asking."
S05E08,JERRY,Who is it?
S05E08,ENZO,(yelling) Enzo Manginero.
S05E08,JERRY,"Oh my god, he knows. (Jerry and Gino scrambling) Go. (yelling to the door) One second."
S05E08,ENZO,It was you that was in Gino's apartment the other night.
S05E08,JERRY,No I wasn't there. (enters and slams the door)
S05E08,ENZO,Don't lie. I know it was you. I get a sample of your hair. I match them up.
S05E08,JERRY,"Sample? (under his breath) Newman. Uh, I was there but I was just dropping off a book."
S05E08,GINO,Don't Jerry.
S05E08,ENZO,"So, it's true."
S05E08,GINO,Yes it's true.
S05E08,ENZO,I'm going to kill the both of you.
S05E08,GEORGE,"Mr. Tuttle, you're back."
S05E08,TUTTLE,"George, I'm surprised to see you here."
S05E08,GEORGE,You are?
S05E08,TUTTLE,I thought you would have taken the large office.
S05E08,GEORGE,Oh. Really.
S05E08,TUTTLE,I guess I didn't make that clear when I hired you. So where's that Pensky file? Let's see what you've been up to all week.
S05E08,GEORGE,"Ah, here it is."
S05E08,TUTTLE,(pages through the file) What have you been doing all week?
S05E08,GEORGE,Well you missed a lovely little party that we had for Grace.
S05E08,TUTTLE,You haven't done anything with this.
S05E08,GEORGE,Well bear in mind that I am in the smaller office.
S05E08,TUTTLE,I'm beginning to wonder if you understand anything.
S05E08,GEORGE,You are aware that Pensky is interested in me.
S05E08,TUTTLE,(scoffs) You're not Pensky material.
S05E08,GEORGE,"(chuckles) Really? Well, we'll just see about that. Ta-ta, Tut-tle."
S05E08,PENSKY,"Gee George, I'm sorry I gave you the wrong impression. What is was going to say was, now you are aware that our Board of Directors has been indicted, myself included, and we're prohibited from doing business until the investigation is completed. So obviously, we would have no use for you."
S05E08,GEORGE,Obviously.
S05E08,PENSKY,Yes.
S05E08,SECRETARY,"(over the speaker) Excuse me, but Mr. Costanza's car is being towed."
S05E08,KRAMER,(on the phone in Jerry's apartment) So when are you gonna be able to go out?
S05E08,NEWMAN,(on the phone in his apartment with a Bald head) Not for a while.
S05E09,[Setting,Night club]
S05E09,JERRY,"If there's a serial killer lose in your neighborhood, it seems like the safest thing is to be the neighbor. They never kill the neighbor. The neighbor always survives to do the interview afterwards. Right? ""Oh, he was kind of quiet."" I love these neighbors. They're never disturbed by the sounds of murdering, just stereo. Chain saws, people screaming, fine. Just keep the music down. And all these women who always fall in love with the serial killer. They write to him in prison. Here's a woman that's hard to disappoint. I guess she's only upset when she finds out he's stopped killing people and she goes ""You know sometimes I feel like I don't even know who you are anymore""."
S05E09,[setting,Elaine's office and Jerry's apartment]
S05E09,JERRY,No eight years isn't such a long streak.
S05E09,ELAINE,It isn't?
S05E09,JERRY,No I haven't vomited in thirteen years.
S05E09,ELAINE,Get out!
S05E09,JERRY,"Not since June 29, 1980."
S05E09,ELAINE,You remember the date?
S05E09,JERRY,"Yes, because my previous vomit was also June 29th... 1972. That's why during the '80 vomit, I was yelling to George ""Can you believe it? I'm vomiting on June 29th again."""
S05E09,ELAINE,"Boy, you know when Joel told me he hadn't thrown up in eight years, I was wondering if he was normal."
S05E09,JERRY,No Elaine he's normal. Your boyfriend is a normal guy. He just happens to have the same name as one of the worst serial killers in the history of New-York.
S05E09,ELAINE,"Yeah... (2 co-workers enter Elaine's office) Oh Jer, I gotta go. I gotta go. (she hangs up)"
S05E09,JOANNE,"Hi, we just saw your boyfriend at a bus stop."
S05E09,ELAINE,"Oh, yeah?"
S05E09,JOANNE,Yeah. What's his name?
S05E09,ELAINE,Joel...
S05E09,JOANNE,Joel what?
S05E09,ELAINE,Uh... (clears her throat) Rifkin.
S05E09,MICHAEL,Rifkin? Joel Rifkin?
S05E09,ELAINE,Yeah. It's just a coincidence obviously.
S05E09,MICHAEL,Guess you better keep on his good side.
S05E09,ELAINE,Very funny. That's very funny.
S05E09,JOANNE,I wouldn't sleep with my back to him if I were you.
S05E09,ELAINE,All right. Well that's enough of that. That's enough.
S05E09,MICHAEL,Hey Elaine listen. If you smell anything decaying in the trunk of his car...
S05E09,ELAINE,"(she's upset, gets up and yells) OK look this is my boyfriend we're talking about OK? And he's a gentlemen, he's good looking, he's a good shaver and he hasn't thrown up in eigth years so just shut up about him! Shut up!"
S05E09,[setting,Jerry's]
S05E09,ELAINE,"The whole city is talking about this monster Joel Rifkin, and I am dating a Joel Rifkin."
S05E09,JERRY,But you like your Joel Rifkin.
S05E09,ELAINE,Yeah. I just wish he has a different name.
S05E09,JERRY,Ask him to change it.
S05E09,ELAINE,You can't ask a person to change their name.
S05E09,JERRY,Why not?
S05E09,ELAINE,Would you change yours?
S05E09,JERRY,If someone asked me nicely. I'm Claude Seinfeld.
S05E09,ELAINE,"Hey, how many people did Rifkin strangle? Eighteen?"
S05E09,JERRY,Yeah. Eighteen strangles.
S05E09,KRAMER,You know why Rifkin was a serial killer? Because he was adopted. (saying it as he's taking a lot of paper towels from Jerry's roll; Elaine and Jerry are confused at Kramer's statement) Just like Son of Sam was adopted. So apparently adoption leads to serial killing. (Kramer leaves and we don't know why he needed so much paper towels)
S05E09,ELAINE,You know Joel and I have an extra ticket to the Giants game.
S05E09,KRAMER,I'll go.
S05E09,ELAINE,O.K. I'll leave the ticket for you at will call.
S05E09,KRAMER,Yeah! Ooh! (leaves again)
S05E09,ELAINE,You think I should have asked George?
S05E09,JERRY,Hey did you hear that George got back with Karen?
S05E09,ELAINE,Karen?
S05E09,JERRY,"Risotto. (we see a flashback from The Mango where Karen tells George that she feels full after a Risotto, as opposed to when she has sex with him)"
S05E09,ELAINE,Oh! The Risotto broad.
S05E09,JERRY,Yeah. He's really got a good thing with her. In fact I'm doubling with them tonight.
S05E09,ELAINE,I tought you didn't like double dates.
S05E09,JERRY,"George likes them, he feels it's a good personality showcase. He likes a date to see him with a friend so she can get a window into his nondate personality."
S05E09,ELAINE,I've looked through that window and screamed at him to shut the blinds.
S05E09,JERRY,"He feels he's funnier, more relaxed."
S05E09,ELAINE,And you're taking...
S05E09,JERRY,Jody the masseuse.
S05E09,ELAINE,"Hey, did you get a massage yet?"
S05E09,JERRY,No! How many times do I have to go out with her before I get a massage?
S05E09,ELAINE,"Jerry, she gives massages all day. She doesn't wanna to give them on dates."
S05E09,JERRY,Yeah I know... She just wants to have sex.
S05E09,ELAINE,So what?
S05E09,JERRY,"So it's like going to Idhao and eating carrots. I like carrots, but I'm in Idhao, I want a potato."
S05E09,[setting,The Chinese restaurant (the same as in 'The Chinese Restaurant')]
S05E09,GEORGE,"(George is telling a story. Karen is laughing and she seems to be the only one to find him funny) So I go into this clothing store and the saleswoman is wearing this (whistling) low cut thing. So I said to her ""Can I ask you a question? When you put on a top like that, what's your tought process? What's going on in your mind?"""
S05E09,KAREN,That is so funny.
S05E09,GEORGE,(to Jody) You're listening to this?
S05E09,JODI,Yeah. I heard you.
S05E09,JERRY,(to Jody) My neck is killing me. Right in this spot. Very tender over here.
S05E09,JODI,(to George) So what did she say?
S05E09,GEORGE,Well nothing. I didn't actually say that. (Karen is still laughing)
S05E09,JODI,You just said that you said it.
S05E09,GEORGE,"Sweetheart, I was exaggerating."
S05E09,KAREN,I'm learning a lot about you tonight George. I've never seen you like this.
S05E09,JERRY,(touching the back of his neck) It's like somebody's pulling on wires back here.
S05E09,GEORGE,You know it's like you never see a really attractive woman getting a traffic ticket.
S05E09,JODI,How can you say that? My sister got a ticket last week. Are you saying she's not attractive?
S05E09,GEORGE,"Well I've never met your sister but obviously these are not hard-and-fast rules. (to the waitress) Darling, the tea is getting a little cold sweetheart."
S05E09,JODI,(to Jerry) Can we go?
S05E09,JERRY,Yeah. Let's go.
S05E09,KAREN,So soon? (they get up)
S05E09,JERRY,Yeah. Good seeing you again Karen.
S05E09,KAREN,Yeah.
S05E09,JODI,Nice meeting you Karen.
S05E09,KAREN,Yeah. Nice to meet you too and I'm gonna call you about that massage.
S05E09,JODI,Oh yeah.
S05E09,GEORGE,Jody let's do this agian real soon (he tends his arms for a hug but she avoids him)
S05E09,JODI,Yeah. (she and Jerry walk away)
S05E09,[setting,Jerry's place later that night]
S05E09,JERRY,I strained my neck last night.
S05E09,JODI,"Really, how?"
S05E09,JERRY,I tried brushing my teeth by holding the brush and moving my head from side to side. It didn't work.
S05E09,JODI,So what's the deal with your friend George?
S05E09,JERRY,No deal. Why?
S05E09,JODI,"What was all that ""attractive women not getting tickets"" nonsense?"
S05E09,JERRY,"Oh well, he was just showcasing his nondate pesonality."
S05E09,JODI,I don't know how you can hang out with that guy.
S05E09,JERRY,Yeah. Sometimes he really makes me tense (he takes Jody's hand and put it on his shoulder)
S05E09,JODI,Did you see the way that he was eating?
S05E09,JERRY,"Yeah, he's disgusting. (putting her hand back on his shoulder. She unconsciously starts to massage a little while watching TV)"
S05E09,JODI,"I have to tell you, I really don't like him."
S05E09,JERRY,"Yeah, me either. (he takes her other hand and put it on his other shoulder)"
S05E09,JODI,It's just I hate that type.
S05E09,JERRY,"Yeah, he's a bad seed."
S05E09,JODI,"Now you however, you, I like. (she stops massaging and kisses Jerry)"
S05E09,JERRY,What are you doing?
S05E09,JODI,What do you think I'm doing? (he won't get his massage...)
S05E09,[setting,The Chinese restaurant]
S05E09,GEORGE,"So, what do you think?"
S05E09,KAREN,Really enjoyed it.
S05E09,GEORGE,Jody's nice.
S05E09,KAREN,She's very nice. (grabs George's hand) Let's discuss this later.
S05E09,GEORGE,You think she liked me? She seemed to like me.
S05E09,KAREN,Yeah
S05E09,GEORGE,I was personable. Don't you think I was personable?
S05E09,KAREN,You were extremely personable.
S05E09,GEORGE,I tought I picked up a little something. I'm very good at this. Did you pick up anything?
S05E09,KAREN,I didn't pick up anything.
S05E09,GEORGE,"The second time I sent the noodles back, I tought she made a face..."
S05E09,KAREN,I didn't see a face.
S05E09,GEORGE,I tought I saw a face.
S05E09,KAREN,"Anyhow, what is the difference?"
S05E09,GEORGE,No difference. I could care less. She's Jerry's girlfriend.
S05E09,KAREN,"George, George, instead of talking about this, we could be... you know... (she makes a move with her head like George did in 'The Mango' while saying ""instead of the movie..."")"
S05E09,GEORGE,He he he he
S05E09,KAREN,Ah ah ah ah
S05E09,GEORGE,So you think she likes me?
S05E09,[setting,Elaine's place]
S05E09,ELAINE,(as he touches her) Uhh! What are you doing?
S05E09,JOEL,Massaging your neck.
S05E09,ELAINE,Oh. Huh. Of course. Massaging.
S05E09,JOEL,"Uh, boning up on football? (talking about the magazine she's reading as he sits beside her)"
S05E09,ELAINE,"Yeah, yeah. You know what? There are a lot of players named Deon these days. What a cool name, Deon. If I were gonna change my name, I'd go with Deon."
S05E09,JOEL,Deon Benes?
S05E09,ELAINE,"Well as a woman, it makes no sense. But, I mean, let's say I was you. And I decided I was gonna change my name for no real reasons whatsoever-- Deon Rifkin. Wow! That is so cool."
S05E09,JOEL,D-Deon Rifkin?
S05E09,ELAINE,"Well maybe you're not the Dion type. O.K. then let's see, let's see, what do we got? (looking at the magazine, she starts to gasp and loses it) Oh! Oh oh oh! O.J.! O.J. Rifkin! You don't even use a name, it's just initials. Oh please please please change your name to O.J.! Please, it would be so great!"
S05E09,JOEL,Elaine! What is going on?
S05E09,[setting,Monk's]
S05E09,GEORGE,She stayed over?
S05E09,JERRY,Yeah. (disappointed)
S05E09,GEORGE,The sex wasn't so good?
S05E09,JERRY,No. The sex was fabulous.
S05E09,GEORGE,So?
S05E09,JERRY,I want the massage!
S05E09,GEORGE,Did you ask her?
S05E09,JERRY,"I tried putting her hands there (on his neck) but she pulls it away immediately, she's not into it."
S05E09,GEORGE,Why not?
S05E09,JERRY,I guess 'cause it's her job. It's very frustrating.
S05E09,GEORGE,So we had a good time... the four of us.
S05E09,JERRY,Yeah.
S05E09,GEORGE,We all got along. Everyone seemed very pleasant.
S05E09,JERRY,Yeah.
S05E09,GEORGE,What did Jodi say?
S05E09,JERRY,She had a good time.
S05E09,GEORGE,Is that it?
S05E09,JERRY,Pretty much.
S05E09,GEORGE,"Did she say anything about, uh..."
S05E09,JERRY,What?
S05E09,GEORGE,Nah. It's all right. Great! She had a good time.
S05E09,JERRY,Yeah (a so-so yeah as he takes a sip of coffee)
S05E09,GEORGE,You just hesitated.
S05E09,JERRY,I was blowing on the coffee.
S05E09,GEORGE,She didn't like me?
S05E09,JERRY,Look it's not like you're gonna be spending a lot of time with her.
S05E09,GEORGE,So she doesn't like me?
S05E09,JERRY,No.
S05E09,GEORGE,She said that?
S05E09,JERRY,Yes.
S05E09,GEORGE,She told you she doesn't like me!
S05E09,JERRY,Yes.
S05E09,GEORGE,What were her exact--
S05E09,JERRY,"""I don't like him."""
S05E09,GEORGE,Uh-Huh (gulp) Why didn't she like me?
S05E09,JERRY,Not everybody likes everybody!
S05E09,GEORGE,I tried to be nice. I wasn't nice?
S05E09,JERRY,You were very nice!
S05E09,GEORGE,I bent over backwards for that woman! Is it that thing I said about her sister?
S05E09,JERRY,It has nothing to do with her sister.
S05E09,GEORGE,"I don't even know her sister but believe me, if she's getting traffic tickets, she's not that good-looking! Woah"
S05E09,[setting,hall in Jerry's building]
S05E09,GEORGE,You vomited in 1987.
S05E09,JERRY,Oh no. That was the dry heaves.
S05E09,JERRY,Jodi.
S05E09,JODI,"Hey, Jerry."
S05E09,GEORGE,Ha! Ha! Hey! (moving his arms like it's so great to be all here)
S05E09,JERRY,What are you doing here?
S05E09,JODI,I was giving Kramer a massage.
S05E09,JERRY,Kramer! (tries to hide he's upset and jealous)
S05E09,JODI,I got to run. I have an appointment downtown.
S05E09,GEORGE,Here. Let me take your tabe downstairs for you.
S05E09,JODI,No that's O.K.
S05E09,GEORGE,Please give it to me. I love to help people. This is what I do. Come on. I'm going this way. (he takes the table from Jodi's hands and she has no choice but to follow him)
S05E09,JERRY,I'll see you tonight. (he's opening his door apartment as Kramer comes out of his in a bathrobe)
S05E09,KRAMER,Hey! I am looser than creamed corn!
S05E09,JERRY,Who told you to get a massage from her. I haven't gotten a massage from her yet!
S05E09,KRAMER,You don't know what you're missing buddy.
S05E09,[setting,street in front of Jerry's building]
S05E09,GEORGE,"No one hails a cab like me. My hailing technique is unmatched. I get the wrist going from side to side and boom! Cabs are crashing into themselves to just pick me up. (a cab stops) All right, here we go. Let me get door. Feminists aside, I know women like the door holding. Here we are all righty. O.K. Jodi let's get together again real soon and say hello to your sister for me."
S05E09,JODI,You've never met. (the cab starts and George is following to keep talking to Jodi)
S05E09,GEORGE,"Whatever. Believe me, if I wasn't involved right now, I wouldn't mind being set up. Something tells me she's a knockout. (we see, from the camera inside the cab, George's hand waving as the cab drives away)"
S05E09,[setting,Jerry's apartment]
S05E09,KRAMER,"(Kramer is talking much more slowly and smoother than usual) First she sets the mood perfectly with this new age music played over ocean sounds. Then she lays you out on this table, and she proceeds to rub oil over your entire body. And she rubs long... and deep... Jerry, she rubs with love. (Jerry is obviously cutting much harder than the cheese needs it as he listens to Kramer) Every muscles she touches just... (long pause) ooo-zz-es. Beneath those silky, soft fingers, you can scarcely contain yourself, buddy. (Jerry slams down the knife and goes to the couch)"
S05E09,JERRY,So you had a good time.
S05E09,KRAMER,Oh... yeah...
S05E09,JERRY,Enjoyed yourself.
S05E09,KRAMER,Very... much...
S05E09,JERRY,All right now you listen and you listen good! (he grabs Kramer's legs and throws him down the couch)
S05E09,KRAMER,What! (Kramer is back to his usual way of speaking)
S05E09,JERRY,The massages are out!
S05E09,KRAMER,Wha--
S05E09,JERRY,Ahh!!! They're out!
S05E09,KRAMER,Why?!
S05E09,JERRY,"Because if I can't get one, you're not getting one."
S05E09,KRAMER,Wait a minute! Wait a minute! I need my massages! Can't you see I'm burned out!
S05E09,JERRY,"I'm sorry, Kramer. (he goes back to the kitchen)"
S05E09,KRAMER,"Why? Why? Look, I paid for her. (Jerry stops walking)"
S05E09,JERRY,Don't you ever talk about her like that!
S05E09,KRAMER,But why?
S05E09,JERRY,That's final!!!

S05E09,JOEL,Yeah. Why? Is that weird?
S05E09,ELAINE,"No, it's normal. You're very normal. You're totally normal. Who's this?"
S05E09,JOEL,That's my mother.
S05E09,ELAINE,Oh yeah. I see the resemblance.
S05E09,JOEL,"No, there's no resemblance."
S05E09,ELAINE,"Yeah, there is, right here you see--"
S05E09,JOEL,"Elaine, I was adopted."
S05E09,ELAINE,(pause) Oh. That's nice.
S05E09,JOEL,"Oh, the game's about to start. I wonder where your friend Kramer is."
S05E09,[setting,ticket counter]
S05E09,KRAMER,"(to the ticket man) Uh, yeah, a ticket for Kramer."
S05E09,TICKET MAN,Here it is. I need some I.D.
S05E09,KRAMER,"Oh, yeah. (snaps fingers) You know, I forgot my wallet."
S05E09,TICKET MAN,"Well, I can't give it to you then."
S05E09,KRAMER,Are you kidding me?
S05E09,TICKET MAN,I'm afraid not.
S05E09,KRAMER,"Come on, just look at me. Tell me I'm not Kramer."
S05E09,TICKET MAN,I'm sorry. I need proof.
S05E09,KRAMER,"Look, I'll drive out here tomorrow and I'll show the I.D. I got nothing to do all day."
S05E09,TICKET MAN,"Neither do I. But without I.D., I need confirmation from the person who left the ticket."
S05E09,KRAMER,Where's a phone?
S05E09,[setting,back to Elaine and Joel watching the game]
S05E09,ANNOUNCER,"Ladies and gentlemen, may I have your attention, please? Would Joel Rifkin report to the stadium office. Joel Rifkin...telephone. (the crowd stops cheering and we see a football player, Lawrence Taylor of the N.Y. Giants, distracted from the game while hearing the announcer saying Joel Rifkin)"
S05E09,JOEL,Who would be calling me here? (he stands up and look around)
S05E09,ELAINE,(to the person in front of her) He's not the murderer.
S05E09,[setting,Jerry's apartment]
S05E09,KRAMER,"Oh, God."
S05E09,JERRY,What's the matter with you?
S05E09,KRAMER,"Jerry, I need another massage!"
S05E09,JERRY,You just had one yesterday. What do you need another one for?
S05E09,KRAMER,"Because of the Giant game! I told you, It went overtime! You know what those seats are like. They're very unforgiving."
S05E09,JERRY,Oh please.
S05E09,KRAMER,"And then the game-winning field goal went over the net and into the crowd and I dove over three rows! My back, it's killing me! (whining) It's killing me Jerry!"
S05E09,JERRY,"Well, did you get the ball?"
S05E09,KRAMER,Oh I got the ball.
S05E09,JERRY,"Well, I never even caught a foul ball at a baseball game."
S05E09,KRAMER,"Well, It's quite a thrill."
S05E09,JERRY,Why don't you get somebody else?
S05E09,KRAMER,Because nobody does it like she does. She's the best.
S05E09,JERRY,"Well, that's it! Tonight's the night. I'm getting one. No ""if and's or but's""."
S05E09,KRAMER,What about my massage?
S05E09,JERRY,(whining like Kramer) Ask Newman.
S05E09,[setting,Monk's]
S05E09,GEORGE,So I lugged that table. That big heavy massage table all the way down to the cab! You ever seen one of those things?
S05E09,KAREN,Of course.
S05E09,GEORGE,"No, I don't know. Maybe you haven't. You know, not everybody's seen a massage table."
S05E09,KAREN,"What, do you think I've never had a massage before?"
S05E09,GEORGE,"Anyway, I don't even get a thank you. I don't get it!"
S05E09,KAREN,"George, frankly, I'm getting a little tired of hearing about her."
S05E09,GEORGE,I wanna know what I did to this woman.
S05E09,KAREN,"What, you got a little thing for her?"
S05E09,GEORGE,"No, No! She's going out with a friend of mine. It's only courteous that we should try and like each other."
S05E09,KAREN,What difference does it make? Who cares if she doesn't like you? Does everybody in the world have to like you?
S05E09,GEORGE,Yes! Yes! Everybody has to like me. I must be liked!
S05E09,[setting,Elaine's apartment]
S05E09,ELAINE,Of course I support your decision to change your name.
S05E09,JOEL,After the Giant game I realized that this--this problem isn't going away.
S05E09,ELAINE,"Well, listen, I just want you to know that I was more than willing to stick it out with Joel Rifkin."
S05E09,JOEL,Sure?
S05E09,ELAINE,(she fakes a strangling) RRR...
S05E09,JOEL,O.K. you got your list?
S05E09,ELAINE,Yeah. Yeah. 10 names.
S05E09,JOEL,Right.
S05E09,ELAINE,"O.K. And if somebody objects, you can just veto it."
S05E09,JOEL,O.K.
S05E09,ELAINE,O.K. You start. What's your first choice?
S05E09,JOEL,Stuart.
S05E09,ELAINE,(right away) No. Second choice.
S05E09,JOEL,Stu--Stuart's no good?
S05E09,ELAINE,I have never met a normal guy named Stuart.
S05E09,JOEL,O-O.K. My second choice is... Todd.
S05E09,ELAINE,(repeating to hear how it sounds) Todd. (pause) No. Veto.
S05E09,JOEL,"All right. Oh, hey, I think you're gonna like my first my third choice."
S05E09,ELAINE,Great...
S05E09,JOEL,Alex.
S05E09,ELAINE,"I gotta tell ya, I have a bad association with the name Alex."
S05E09,JOEL,Bad bad association?
S05E09,ELAINE,"Yeah, in college I sat next to an Alex in art history. And he was always drinking coffee and after every sip he would go ""Ahh"". I mean every two seconds ""Ahh"". And he would take like 40 sips and after everyone ""Ahh"". I had to drop the class."

S05E09,JODI,Hi. (kiss) I was running late and I didn't have a chance to drop off my stuff before I came over.
S05E09,JERRY,"Ah, no problem. That's fine."
S05E09,JODI,What's with this music?
S05E09,JERRY,"That's new age music. Sounds of the forest. I find it soothing. Hey, look at this! What do you know? A massage table! This is great! (he starts to install the table)"
S05E09,JODI,What are you doing?
S05E09,JERRY,Just checking it out. Look at how this thing is made. Can I tell you something? That's a hell of a piece of equipment.
S05E09,JODI,"Actually, I should get a new one."
S05E09,JERRY,"No, nonsense. This one's fine. (as he sits on the table)"
S05E09,JODI,"So, where do you wanna go? (as she puts her hand on his shoulder)"
S05E09,JERRY,"Go? Why go anywhere? (as he places his hand over hers. She starts to massage his shoulders a little) Ahh, that feels good. Yeah. That's, uh... That's good. (he tries to go further. He grabs her hands over his shoulders and he lies down on the table on his chest) Yeah, that's nice. That's very nice."
S05E09,JODI,"(she stops massaging) No. No, this isn't good. I can't do this."
S05E09,JERRY,"Why, what's wrong? (he grabs her hands and force her to keep them on his shoulders)"
S05E09,JODI,I can't (she tries harder to pull her hands away)
S05E09,JERRY,No. Yes you can. (he hangs on)
S05E09,JODI,"No, I can't!"
S05E09,JERRY,Come on! I know it's something you wanna do! (she pulls harder and he falls right off the table)
S05E09,[setting,Karen's place]
S05E09,GEORGE,"You know what? I should really go talk to her. Nothing confrontational. Just two adults sitting down trying to clear the air. You know, I just know if I could spend some time alone with her. I've got to. (he grabs his jacket) I've got to."
S05E09,KAREN,You're going now?
S05E09,GEORGE,I think I can still catch her.
S05E09,KAREN,All right George. I have had just about enough of this.
S05E09,GEORGE,What? What are you talking about.
S05E09,KAREN,I am talking about you and Jodi. You're completely obsessed with her!
S05E09,GEORGE,I know. I know.
S05E09,KAREN,"Who is more important to you, her or me? I like you, she doesn't. Who are you gonna pick?"
S05E09,GEORGE,"(he thinks a little about it... and as he puts his hand on his knee and gets up) I'm sorry Karen. I know I care for you, but I just can't stand when someone doesn't like me. (he opens the door)"

S05E09,ELAINE,What is wrong with Ned?
S05E09,JOEL,Ned's a guy who buys irregular underwear. Next!
S05E09,ELAINE,Ellis.
S05E09,JOEL,Ellis?! You might as well go with Alex. It's the same thing!
S05E09,ELAINE,Ellis and Alex aren't even close.
S05E09,JOEL,NEXT!
S05E09,ELAINE,"Ohh, what is the point?"
S05E09,JOEL,"NO, NO. COME ON!"
S05E09,ELAINE,O.K. O.K. Remy.
S05E09,JOEL,Remy Rifkin? Should I get a beret?
S05E09,ELAINE,"Oh, Stuart's a lot better! (talking like a baby) Little Stuart Rifkin likes to go shopping with his mother."
S05E09,JOEL,Grrrr!
S05E09,[setting,back to Jerry's]
S05E09,JERRY,"What do you mean, no?"
S05E09,JODI,No means no.
S05E09,JERRY,"Look, who are you kidding? You come up to my apartment with your table and your little oils, and I'm not supposed to expect anything? You're a massage teaser."
S05E09,JODI,"Listen. I massage who I want, when I want. I don't submit to forcible massage. (he tries desperately to get her hands on his shoulders again but she pulls them away immediately) I'm getting out of here."
S05E09,JERRY,Fine. Go.
S05E09,GEORGE,"Jerry, could you excuse us for a few minutes, please?"
S05E09,JERRY,What for?
S05E09,GEORGE,We need to talk.
S05E09,JERRY,You need to talk?
S05E09,JODI,We have nothing to talk about.
S05E09,GEORGE,Look it's no secret what's going on between us. (to Jerry) She doesn't like me. Now Jerry if you don't mind.
S05E09,JERRY,"George, anything you have to say to her, you can say in front of me."
S05E09,GEORGE,(he makes a sign to Jodi to wait and turns to Jerry) Jerry... This woman hates me so much. I'm starting to like her.
S05E09,JERRY,What?
S05E09,GEORGE,She just dislikes me so much... It's irresistable.
S05E09,JERRY,I can see that.
S05E09,JODI,I'm getting out of here. (to Jerry) Don't call me.
S05E09,JERRY,Don't worry. (she leaves)
S05E09,GEORGE,A woman that hates me this much comes along once in a lifetime.
S05E09,JERRY,You're a lucky guy.
S05E09,GEORGE,I got to go after her.
S05E09,JERRY,George. I wouldn't push for the massage. (George nods)
S05E09,GEORGE,JODI! (he starts running after her)
S05E09,JERRY,"The swedish are very big massagers. You know? They like the swedish meatballs, swedish massage. They like having meat in their hands these people, for some reason. But it's weird because they have the highest suicide rate, they're rubbing each other's necks all the time for a neutral country they seem kinda tense. I don't really like the idea of getting a professional massage. I don't want people touching me that don't know me and don't want to have sex with me. You know what are you bothering me for? You get me all loosened up, juices flowing, and then that's it ok, you're done. It's like having chocolate rubbed all over your face, you know you wanna go ""Excuse me, I think you missed a spot."""
S05E10,JERRY,"You can always tell what was the best year of your father's life, because they seem to just freeze that clothing style and just ride it out to the end, don't they? And it's not like they don't continue shopping, it's just they somehow manage to find new old clothes. Every father is like this fashion time capsule, you know what I mean. It's like they should be on a pedestal, with someone next to 'em going 'This was nineteen sixty-five'. To me the worst thing is shopping for pants. I hate dressing and undressing in that little room. What men need is a place to shop where you go in, you check your pants at the door, and you just walk around the store in your underwear. That would be the best way. Then you'd really have to lie to the salesman. 'Need some help?' 'No, just getting some air.'"
S05E10,JERRY,How would you describe the smell in this house?
S05E10,ELAINE,(sniffing) Dandruff?
S05E10,JERRY,"Yeah, that's part of it. (sniffs) Kasha?"
S05E10,ELAINE,There's some kasha.
S05E10,JERRY,"Yeah. Dandruff, kasha, mothballs, cheap carpeting. It's pot pourri, really."
S05E10,ELAINE,"Alright, let's go, come on."
S05E10,GEORGE,Wha... you're going?
S05E10,ELAINE,"Yeah. You know we shouldn't have bowled that last game, I'm gonna be late."
S05E10,KRAMER,Egh. These aren't candies.
S05E10,GEORGE,Wha? Did you use those? These are guest soaps! (he grabs the soaps and begins examining them for damage)
S05E10,KRAMER,Well I'm a guest.
S05E10,GEORGE,Now my parents are gonna know I had people over.
S05E10,JERRY,You're not allowed to have people over?
S05E10,GEORGE,I can't have any parties while they're out of town. (he leaves to return the soaps)
S05E10,KRAMER,"What, this is a party?"
S05E10,ELAINE,"Not any more. Come on, get your ball, we're leaving. Let's go, let's go."
S05E10,GEORGE,(yells) Wow! Who put this cup right on the new table!
S05E10,JERRY,"(picks it up) I was having coffee, I put it on the coffee table."
S05E10,GEORGE,"But you didn't use a coaster, Jerry, you left a stain! (he runs to kitchen)"
S05E10,KRAMER,"Whoah boy. There's always one at every party, huh?"
S05E10,ELAINE,(impatient) Come on!
S05E10,JERRY,What's the big rush?
S05E10,ELAINE,I'm having people over.
S05E10,JERRY,Who?
S05E10,ELAINE,"The girls for poker night. You know, Joanne, Renee, Winona..."
S05E10,JERRY,"Eh, eh, ah. Winona's gonna be there?"
S05E10,ELAINE,Yeah. And she broke up with the vitamin guy.
S05E10,JERRY,(interested) Really?
S05E10,ELAINE,I'll put in a good word for you.
S05E10,JERRY,"Thanks, because I would really like... (distractedly puts coffee cup back on the table)"
S05E10,GEORGE,(screaming) Aaahh!!
S05E10,JERRY,"Alright, I'm sorry. I'm sorry. (picks it up again)"
S05E10,GEORGE,"But Jerry, this is not coming out!"
S05E10,JERRY,Just put a coffee table book over it.
S05E10,GEORGE,My parents don't read! They're gonna wonder what a book is doing on the table!
S05E10,KRAMER,"Hey, hey, hey, hey. You know what would make a great coffee table book? A coffee table book about coffee tables! Get it?"
S05E10,ELAINE,"Got it! C'mon, let's go, let's go. Bye George."
S05E10,GEORGE,"Wait, wait wait, not so fast. Jerry, you gotta take me to get this thing refinished."
S05E10,ELAINE,Now?!
S05E10,GEORGE,"Yes, now. It's gonna take a few days and my parents are gonna be back. I gotta have it back before them!"
S05E10,ELAINE,"Jerry, you promised you'd get me home by seven."
S05E10,KRAMER,"Alright, we'll take the subway."
S05E10,JERRY,There you go. That'll get you home in time.
S05E10,ELAINE,Oh! The subway? From Queens?
S05E10,GEORGE,"Alright, Jerry, I'm gonna get my coat."
S05E10,JERRY,"I'm sorry Elaine, I'll make it up to you."
S05E10,ELAINE,I need something to read on the subway.
S05E10,JERRY,"(handing her a magazine) Here, read this."
S05E10,ELAINE,(looks at it) TV Guide?
S05E10,KRAMER,"Like a history of coffee tables, celebrities and their coffee tables. It's a natural. This is a story that must be told."
S05E10,ELAINE,(engrossed in magazine) Hmm-mmm.
S05E10,KRAMER,"So, you're gonna talk to your boss about it, huh?"
S05E10,ELAINE,(still paying no attention) Hmm-mmm. First thing in the morning.
S05E10,KRAMER,(claps hands) Yes indeed.
S05E10,TANNOY (V.O.),"Next stop, Queensboro Plaza."
S05E10,KRAMER,"Oh, Queensboro Plaza. (reties his shoelaces) This stop is famous for its gyros, you want one?"
S05E10,ELAINE,How are you gonna get something and get back on the train in time?
S05E10,KRAMER,"Well, they got a stand right out on the platform. Gyros are cooked, and wrapped, and ready to go. (he pulls money from his pocket) Three dollars, no change. You want one?"
S05E10,ELAINE,(laughing) No thanks.
S05E10,KRAMER,"Alright, but no bites."
S05E10,RICKY,Highlighter?
S05E10,ELAINE,Excuse me?
S05E10,RICKY,To highlight the programmes you plan to watch.
S05E10,ELAINE,"Ah. Uh, look really (looks about to try and avoid contact) I'm just trying to read."
S05E10,RICKY,"Fine, okay. It's just, I've never seen a beautiful lady reading 'the Guide' so far away from a TV. You must really like television."
S05E10,KRAMER,(yells) Elaine!
S05E10,RICKY,Guess your boyfriend'll have to catch the next train.
S05E10,ELAINE,He's not my boyfriend.
S05E10,RICKY,He's not? (thoughtful) Interesting.
S05E10,JERRY,"Hey, maybe I should get Elaine something."
S05E10,GEORGE,Why?
S05E10,JERRY,"Ah, you know, I didn't drive her home. Plus, I give her a gift in front of Winona, how does that hurt me?"
S05E10,GEORGE,Can't hurt you.
S05E10,JERRY,"What about, what about this thing?"
S05E10,GEORGE,The Indian?
S05E10,JERRY,"Yeah. You know, kind of a peace offering. Cute."
S05E10,GEPETTO,"Well, I can have the table ready for you on Monday."
S05E10,GEORGE,"Alright, but no later, because my parents are coming back."
S05E10,GEPETTO,"They left you home alone, huh?"
S05E10,RICKY,"Oh, 'kay, see. On this particular Tuesday (he swaps seats and sits beside Elaine) you could've watched six hours of Lucy. There's I Love Lucy, The Lucy Show, Here's Lucy."
S05E10,ELAINE,"Oh, (nervous laugh) my stop. (making her escape) Bye-bye."
S05E10,RICKY,(after Elaine) Hey miss! (waving TV Guide) You forgot this!
S05E10,GEPETTO,"They don't make these any more. The work is, is all done by hand. (Sylvia enters the store behind him) Takes years, and years, and... (notices) Sylvia! For crying out, you're forty-five minutes late!"
S05E10,SYLVIA,"Yeah, yeah. (to George, smiling) Is that your car out there?"
S05E10,GEORGE,"No, it's, it's his. (indicates Jerry)"
S05E10,SYLVIA,"Oh, nice. You guys are obviously from Manhattan."
S05E10,GEORGE,"Well, he is. I, uh, I live around the corner."
S05E10,SYLVIA,"Really? Ah, I didn't think any cool guys lived in this neighborhood."
S05E10,GEORGE,"(sensing his chance) Well, they do now. Neighborhood's changing."
S05E10,JERRY,"Alright, I'll take it."
S05E10,GEPETTO,Smart choice.
S05E10,SYLVIA,"Wow, you bought the Indian? Oh, you guys have great taste."
S05E10,GEORGE,"Well, we're collectors. We, uh, see objects of great beauty and, uh, we must have them."
S05E10,ELAINE,Knocked you out Jack. Pair of deuces
S05E10,THE GIRLS,(disappointed) Oh/Aah.
S05E10,ELAINE,"(triumphant) Ha, ha, ha ha!"
S05E10,ELAINE,Who is it?
S05E10,JERRY (O.C.),It's Jerry.
S05E10,ELAINE,Jerry!
S05E10,JERRY,Surprise! (he carries in the object)
S05E10,ELAINE,What is this?
S05E10,JERRY,"Well, I felt bad about this afternoon, so I got you something."
S05E10,ELAINE,"Oh, you did? (to girls) Oh, do you guys all know Jerry?"
S05E10,THE GIRLS,Hi Jerry/Hello. (etc)
S05E10,JERRY,Hi. Hi Winona. Nice to see you again.
S05E10,GIRL (NOT WINONA),"Elaine, is it your birthday?"
S05E10,ELAINE,No.
S05E10,JERRY,"I don't need a reason to give gifts, it's my nature. I love to make people happy."
S05E10,THE GIRLS,Aww/That's so sweet. (general murmur of approval)
S05E10,JERRY,Are you ready?
S05E10,ELAINE,Yeah.
S05E10,JERRY,(whips off bag to reveal Indian) Ta-da!
S05E10,JERRY,It's a cigar store Indian. (to Elaine) Read the card.
S05E10,ELAINE,(examines card; embarrassed) That's very nice. Thank you very much.
S05E10,JERRY,Read it out loud.
S05E10,ELAINE,"I, I don't think so."
S05E10,JERRY,(takes the card from Elaine) We had a little fight this afternoon. (reading from card) Let's bury the hatchet. We smoke um peace pipe.
S05E10,WINONA,"(gathering her stuff) Hey, you know, it's late. I really should go."
S05E10,ELAINE,"I, uh, I don't blame you Winona. I, uh..."
S05E10,JERRY,"Hey-yah, ho-ah, hey-yah, ho-ah."
S05E10,ELAINE,Are you out of your mind?!
S05E10,JERRY,"...ho-ah. It's, it's, it's kitschy."
S05E10,ELAINE,Winona is a Native American.
S05E10,JERRY,She is?
S05E10,SYLVIA,You got very unusual taste.
S05E10,GEORGE,(proffering glasses) I hope prune juice is alright. It's the only thing I had that was chilled.
S05E10,SYLVIA,Fine.
S05E10,GEORGE,I'm sorry about that lock on the liquor cabinet. The combination musta just flown outta my head. It's a mental block.
S05E10,SYLVIA,(regarding photo) Ahh! Is this your son in the bubble bath?
S05E10,GEORGE,"(bashful) No, that's me."
S05E10,SYLVIA,Oh. You don't see many guys your age who keep baby pictures of themselves around. (laughs) I like it. Consistent with the rest of the house.
S05E10,GEORGE,"Yes, it is consistent. I've, uh, I've tried to maintain a consistent feel throughout the house."
S05E10,SYLVIA,What is this we're listening to?
S05E10,GEORGE,The Ray Conniff Singers. (nervous chuckle)
S05E10,SYLVIA,"Mmmm, what's that smell? Kasha?"
S05E10,GEORGE,"It's a pot pourri. May I, uh, may I show you the master bedroom? (they leave together)"
S05E10,WINONA (O.C.),Who is it?
S05E10,JERRY,"Uh, Winona, it's Jerry Seinfeld."
S05E10,WINONA,(unimpressed) Yeah?
S05E10,JERRY,"Uhm, listen, I really felt bad about what happened, and I, I, I'd really like to apologise. Can I come up?"
S05E10,WINONA,I'll come down.
S05E10,KRAMER,I came by to get my ball.
S05E10,ELAINE,It's right over there.
S05E10,KRAMER,"Oh, yeah, thanks. (gets ball) Yeah, it's got the magic grip. How d'you think I bowled that two-twenty today, huh? (sees Indian) Yo! Where did this come from?"
S05E10,ELAINE,You want it?
S05E10,KRAMER,(unbelieving) I can have this?!
S05E10,ELAINE,"Yuh! You wanna lug it uptown, it's yours."
S05E10,KRAMER,Oh. I'll lug.
S05E10,WINONA,It's just that it's a very sensitive issue for me.
S05E10,JERRY,"And well it should be. I think if you spent any time with me at all, you'd see I'm very sensitive to these matters as well. You wouldn't be hungry by any chance, wouldya?"
S05E10,WINONA,(smiling) I guess I could go for a bite.
S05E10,JERRY,"You like Chinese food, 'cos I once went to a great Szechwan restaurant in this neighbourhood. I don't remember the exact address... (he spots a mailman crouched emptying a box) Uh, excuse me, you must know where the Chinese restaurant is around here."
S05E10,MAILMAN,"Why must I know? Because I'm Chinese? You think I know where all the Chinese restaurants are? (adopts hackneyed Chinese accent) Oh, ask honorable Chinaman for location of restaurant."
S05E10,JERRY,"I asked because you were the mailman, you would know the neighbourhood."
S05E10,MAILMAN,"Oh, hello American Joe. Which way to hamburger, hotdog stand? (storms away)"
S05E10,JERRY,I didn't know that...
S05E10,WINONA,"You know, it's late. I should probably just go home."
S05E10,JERRY,"I, I had no idea."
S05E10,KRAMER,(yells) Hey Jerry! (thumps cab door with his palm) Look what I got! (begins doing war-whoops)
S05E10,GEORGE,Looks pretty good.
S05E10,JERRY,"Yeah, did a good job."
S05E10,GEORGE,Yeah. I don't think they'll be able to tell.
S05E10,JERRY,"You know, I don't get it. Not allowed to ask a Chinese person where the Chinese restaurant is! I mean, aren't we all getting a little too sensitive? I mean, someone asks me which way is Israel, I don't fly off the handle."
S05E10,GEORGE,"So, anyway, what's uh, what's the status with, uh..."
S05E10,JERRY,"Ah, she kinda calmed down. I talked to her today. In fact I'm gonna see her tonight."
S05E10,GEORGE,"Oh, great."
S05E10,JERRY,"Yeah, but I'm a little uncomfortable. I'm afraid of making another mistake."
S05E10,GEORGE,Aw c'mon.
S05E10,ESTELLE,"Hello, hello!"
S05E10,GEORGE,"(insincerely) Ahh, hey you're home. Hi."
S05E10,ESTELLE,"Oh, the house looks very nice."
S05E10,GEORGE,"Yeah, huh."
S05E10,FRANK,Where's the mail?
S05E10,ESTELLE,Hello Jerry.
S05E10,JERRY,Hello.
S05E10,GEORGE,"So, how was the trip?"
S05E10,ESTELLE,"Ah, your father..."
S05E10,FRANK,Is there anything wrong with getting a receipt at a toll booth?
S05E10,ESTELLE,I'm going upstairs. (she leaves for the bedroom)
S05E10,FRANK,"(examining mail) This stack should be bigger, where's the TV Guide?"
S05E10,GEORGE,What TV Guide?
S05E10,FRANK,"I'm missing TV Guide volume forty-one, number thirty-one."
S05E10,JERRY,"Uh, Elaine took it to read on the subway."
S05E10,FRANK,Elaine took it?
S05E10,GEORGE,I didn't know she took it!
S05E10,JERRY,"Wa, it's two weeks old."
S05E10,FRANK,(shouting) How could you let her take the TV Guide?!
S05E10,GEORGE,(to Jerry) He collects them.
S05E10,JERRY,You collect TV Guide?
S05E10,FRANK,"The nerve of that woman. Walking into my house, stealing my collectible!"
S05E10,ESTELLE,(screaming) Oh my God! (she enters holding a small packet) This was in our bed.
S05E10,FRANK,(taking the packet) What is this? (accusingly to George) A prophylactic wrapper?!
S05E10,ESTELLE,What is this doing on my bed?!
S05E10,GEORGE,"I don't know, uh..."
S05E10,JERRY,I'll see you later. (he leaves with unseemly haste)
S05E10,FRANK,You were having sex on our bed?!
S05E10,GEORGE,Yes!
S05E10,ESTELLE,"Who told you, you could have sex in our bed?"
S05E10,GEORGE,"(pleading) Well, my bed is too small."
S05E10,FRANK,"Your bed is too small? I'm gone two weeks and you turn our house into, into Bourbon Street!"
S05E10,ESTELLE,Where am I going to sleep?
S05E10,GEORGE,What are you talking about?
S05E10,ESTELLE,I can't sleep in there!
S05E10,GEORGE,Of course you can.
S05E10,ESTELLE,I can't! (screams) I can't!
S05E10,FRANK,That's it! You're grounded!
S05E10,GEORGE,"(incredulous) You can't ground me, I'm a grown man."
S05E10,FRANK,You wanna live here? You respect the rules of our house. (yells) You're grounded!
S05E10,WINONA,"So, where are we gonna go eat?"
S05E10,JERRY,I thought we'd eat at the Gentle Harvest.
S05E10,WINONA,"Ooh, I love that place, but it's usually so crowded. Can we get a table?"
S05E10,JERRY,"Ah, don't worry. I made reser... (catches himself)"
S05E10,WINONA,You made what?
S05E10,JERRY,"I uh, I uh, I arranged for the appropriate accommodations. And then, Knick tickets, floor seats."
S05E10,WINONA,How did you get these?
S05E10,JERRY,"Got 'em on the street, from a scal... (catches himself again)"
S05E10,WINONA,From who?
S05E10,JERRY,"A uh, one of those guys."
S05E10,WINONA,What guys?
S05E10,JERRY,"You know, the guys, that uh, they sell the tickets for the sold-out events."
S05E10,WINONA,Oh.
S05E10,JERRY,"Wait a second, you got the Mark McEwan TV Guide."
S05E10,WINONA,That's Al Roker.
S05E10,JERRY,"Oh well, they're both chubby weathermen. I get Dom Deluise and Paul Prudhoe mixed up too. Could I have this?"
S05E10,WINONA,"Sure, take it."
S05E10,JERRY,Thanks.
S05E10,JERRY,"So, Winona had the TV Guide. Told you I'd make it up to you."
S05E10,ELAINE,"Aah, so Mr Costanza was pretty mad, huh?"
S05E10,JERRY,Yeah. You almost ruined his life's work.
S05E10,ELAINE,He collects (holds up magazine) these?
S05E10,JERRY,Yeah.
S05E10,ELAINE,"Wow! Alright, well I will personally go out to Queens and deliver his Al Roker TV Guide to him."
S05E10,JERRY,What'ya do with the one you took?
S05E10,ELAINE,I dunno.
S05E10,ELAINE,Hi.
S05E10,KRAMER,"Yeah uh, Elaine uh, what'd he say?"
S05E10,ELAINE,What did who say?
S05E10,KRAMER,Your boss. Didn't you tell him about the coffee table book?
S05E10,ELAINE,Uhmm...
S05E10,KRAMER,"Yeah, you didn't tell him didya?"
S05E10,ELAINE,"Kramer, it is such a dumb idea. I would be (raising her voice as Kramer speaks his line) totally embarrassed to bring it..."
S05E10,KRAMER,"(simultaneous) Wait a minute, on the cover I'm..."
S05E10,ELAINE,I would be embarrassed to bring it up.
S05E10,JERRY,"I thought it was a pretty good idea. It's about coffee tables, it's on a coffee table."
S05E10,KRAMER,"Yeah, right, right, and on the cover is a built-in coaster. (clicks tongue) Alright, well I'm gonna go."
S05E10,JERRY,Where you going?
S05E10,KRAMER,"Well, I'm gonna go to the cigar stores. I'm gonna see if I can sell that Indian."
S05E10,JERRY,My Indian?
S05E10,KRAMER,"You know, I think it's worth something. It's kitschy. (tongue click)"
S05E10,FRANK,How do you just walk into a house and take a TV Guide? How does she expect you to watch TV? (doorbell rings) Am I just supposed to turn it on and wander aimlessly around the dial?
S05E10,RICKY,Hello. Is Elaine home?
S05E10,ESTELLE,"Elaine Benes? Oh, she's my son's friend."
S05E10,FRANK,(shouting) And she's not welcome in this house!
S05E10,RICKY,"(entering) Oh, 'cos I made her this very special gift. 'Kay, it's a bouquet of paper from her TV Guide."
S05E10,FRANK,(yelling) That's my TV Guide! Ripped to shreds! She gave that to you?!
S05E10,RICKY,"(seeing TV) Hey, is that the Twilight Zone you're watching?"
S05E10,GEORGE,Yeah.
S05E10,RICKY,"Oh, this is a good one."
S05E10,TANNOY (V.O.),"Next stop, Queensboro Plaza."
S05E10,ELAINE (V.O.),"Mmm, gyro."
S05E10,WINONA,I like your place. It's very unassuming.
S05E10,JERRY,"Well, why would I assume. I never assume. Leads to assumptions."
S05E10,WINONA,"(laughs) Oh, by the way. That TV Guide I gave you, I need it back."
S05E10,JERRY,Why?
S05E10,WINONA,"Well, I'm doing a report on minorities in the media, and I wanted to use that interview with Al Roker."
S05E10,JERRY,"Well, it's too late. I gave it to Elaine, and she's already on her way to give it to George's father."
S05E10,WINONA,"Jerry, I really need it back. It, it is mine."
S05E10,JERRY,"You can't give something and then take it back. I mean, what are you... (catches himself)"
S05E10,WINONA,What?
S05E10,JERRY,"A uh, a person that uh..."
S05E10,WINONA,A person that what?
S05E10,JERRY,"Well, a person that gives something and then they're dissatisfied and they wish they had, had never uh..."
S05E10,WINONA,And?
S05E10,JERRY,"...give, given it to the person that they originally gave it to."
S05E10,WINONA,"You mean like, an Indian giver?!"
S05E10,JERRY,"I'm sorry, I'm not familiar with that term."
S05E10,RICKY,I like the special fall preview issues the best.
S05E10,FRANK,Those. I've been saving those from the beginning.
S05E10,RICKY,"These are worth like, a lot of money."
S05E10,ESTELLE,"Oh, hello Elaine!"
S05E10,ELAINE,Hello. (she enters)
S05E10,RICKY,(jumping to his feet) Elaine! Hello! You look scrumptious.
S05E10,FRANK,Why'd you take my TV Guide?
S05E10,ELAINE,"(placatory) I'm so sorry about that Mr Costanza, but look. Look, I brought you another one. (hands it over)"
S05E10,RICKY,I made this for you.
S05E10,ELAINE,"(accepts reluctantly) Oh, thank you."
S05E10,FRANK,(examining magazine) What is this? You got stains all over it! What the hell'd you do?
S05E10,RICKY,"Hey, you can't talk to her like that."
S05E10,FRANK,(yelling) I'll talk to her any way I want!
S05E10,RICKY,"Come on Elaine, let's go."
S05E10,ESTELLE,My coffee table!
S05E10,KRAMER,"I don't understand. How can you have a cigar store, without an Indian? It's unseemly."
S05E10,SPIKE,I'll give you a box of Coronas for it.
S05E10,KRAMER,Forget it.
S05E10,LIPPMAN,"Uh, excuse me. Are you uh, selling this Indian?"
S05E10,KRAMER,"Oh yeah, yeah."
S05E10,LIPPMAN,"Uh, I'm just uh, redecorating my office in a south-western motif and this'd be perfect. Give you five hundred dollars for it?"
S05E10,KRAMER,Giddyup.
S05E10,LIPPMAN,"Yeah? Could you help me bring it up to my office, I'm right next door. Pendant Publishing."
S05E10,KRAMER,Pendant Publishing? Giddyup again.
S05E10,ELAINE,"Mr Lippman. I'm sorry, I was in Queens uh... (sees Kramer) Kramer!"
S05E10,KRAMER,"Yeah, hi Elaine."
S05E10,ELAINE,What are you doing in here with that?
S05E10,KRAMER,"Ah, well, it's a business transaction."
S05E10,LIPPMAN,"(entering, smoking a cigar and with a handful of cash) Listen uh, petty cash just had tens and twenties. (hands cash to Kramer) Go ahead, count it."
S05E10,KRAMER,"Yeah, I'm sure it's all here. (puts in in his pocket) You know I was just admiring your coffee table, out there in the hall."
S05E10,LIPPMAN,"You like that, huh? I had that custom made for me in Santa Fe."
S05E10,KRAMER,You mind if I use it in my book?
S05E10,LIPPMAN,What book?
S05E10,KRAMER,"Well, I'm doing a coffee table book on coffee tables."
S05E10,LIPPMAN,About coffee tables?
S05E10,KRAMER,Uh huh.
S05E10,LIPPMAN,That's fantastic. (Elaine looks gobsmacked) Who's your publisher?
S05E10,KRAMER,"Well, I'm still shopping it around."
S05E10,LIPPMAN,"Yeah? (to Elaine) You see, this is the kind of idea you should be coming in with. What the hell do you do round here all day anyway?"
S05E10,ELAINE,Well I (indistinct) ...manuscript that I...
S05E10,LIPPMAN,"(ignoring Elaine) God, that Indian really completes the room. Don't you think?"
S05E10,SYLVIA,"I know this coffee table, it's George Costanza's."
S05E10,ESTELLE,It's mine. I'm his mother.
S05E10,SYLVIA,"Oh, I haven't seen George for a while. He must be working very hard."
S05E10,ESTELLE,George doesn't work. He's a bum. That's why he lives at home with us.
S05E10,SYLVIA,He does?
S05E10,JERRY,I don't know why we didn't think of this before. We just could call TV Guide.
S05E10,ELAINE,I dunno.
S05E10,JERRY,"Well, it's gonna make Mr Costanza very happy. (he hands the magazine to Elaine)"
S05E10,ELAINE,I guess.
S05E10,JERRY,What's the matter?
S05E10,ELAINE,What d'you think is the matter? I've been assigned to work on Kramer's coffee table book.
S05E10,JERRY,"It is a good idea, Elaine."
S05E10,TANNOY (V.O.),"Next stop, Queensboro Plaza."
S05E10,JERRY,You want a gyro?
S05E10,ELAINE,I don't think so.
S05E10,[Subway train,moments later]
S05E10,JERRY,Elaine!
S05E10,AL ROKER,Guess your boyfriend's gonna have to catch the next train.
S05E10,ELAINE,He's not my boyfriend.
S05E10,AL ROKER,He's not? Interesting. (gives a big grin)
S05E10,JERRY,"I was always excited as a kid, when that new TV Guide would come. Somehow when that front cover's nice and flat, seems like there's good fresh TV shows in. Then, as the weeks go by you start to hate the TV Guide. All the shows stink. Everything's getting all crumpled and ripped from being sat on, thrown across the room. TV Guide is always thrown, never handed, to another person. It's the world's most thrown reading material. 'Where's TV Guide?' (mimes throwing) 'There it is.' You know in the back of the TV Guide, they have a phone number, ninety-five cents a minute, they will give you the answers to the TV Guide crossword puzzle? My question is, if you can't do the TV Guide crossword puzzle, where are you coming across ninety-five cents?"
S05E11,JERRY,"You know doctor is supposed to be such a prestigious occupation. But its really like one of the only jobs where you have to have your diploma right up there on the wall. It makes them seem so insecure, doesnt it? ""I really am a doctor you know. You think Im not, just check it out."" I dont know why they need these little bits of psychological leverage over us all the time. ""Go in that little room, take your pants off, wait 15 minutes, and Ill give you my opinion."" After that, anyone that comes in with pants on seems like they know what theyre talking about. In any difference of opinion, pants always beats no-pants."
S05E11,GEORGE,"Can I say one word to you? Lobster. The lobster here is unbelievable. (looks at the menu) Ooh, a little expensive."
S05E11,SASHA,Twenty five dollars.
S05E11,GEORGE,"Yes, well, you know, Im not thinking about the price. You know youre the only woman Ive never thought about the price. Get the lobster. I beg you to get the lobster. Go for the lobster."
S05E11,SASHA,"George, George, uh, I think we have to talk. I think we have a problem."
S05E11,GEORGE,We do?
S05E11,SASHA,We cant keep seeing each other.
S05E11,GEORGE,Why?
S05E11,SASHA,"(crying) Because its over. (sob, sob, sob) Its my parents George, the differences in our religion. Oh George, can you ever forgive me? (sob)"
S05E11,WAITER,"Uh, have you decided yet?"
S05E11,SASHA,(crying) Yes. Ill have the lobster.
S05E11,GEORGE,"Um, you know Im starting to think that maybe lobster isnt the way to go."
S05E11,JERRY,Then he asked you out?
S05E11,ELAINE,"We started to talk, and I told him that I jog, and then he put his hand on my heart."
S05E11,JERRY,On your heart?
S05E11,ELAINE,"Jerry, the man is a doctor."
S05E11,JERRY,Doctor? Hes a podiatrist.
S05E11,ELAINE,"So, its the same thing."
S05E11,JERRY,Anyone can get into podiatry school. George got into podiatry school.
S05E11,ELAINE,Really?
S05E11,TAWNI,Hello.
S05E11,JERRY,Oh hi.
S05E11,TAWNI,Are you going to be stopping by later?
S05E11,JERRY,"Yes, Ill be stopping."
S05E11,TAWNI,"Ok, see you later."
S05E11,JERRY,See you later. (to Elaine) Well we cant all be dating podiatrists. (Elaine laughs)
S05E11,GEORGE,Its over.
S05E11,ELAINE,What?
S05E11,JERRY,How did you get in?
S05E11,GEORGE,Kramer.
S05E11,ELAINE,Whats that? (points at some foil on the table)
S05E11,GEORGE,Lobster.
S05E11,JERRY,Looks like a swan.
S05E11,GEORGE,She says we cant go out anymore.
S05E11,ELAINE,Why?
S05E11,GEORGE,Because Im not Latvian Orthodox. Her parents wont let her get involved with anyone who isnt Latvian Orthodox.
S05E11,ELAINE,"Latvian Orthodox? (gasps) Mmm, it is lobster."
S05E11,JERRY,Shes limiting herself to Latvian Orthodox? Too bad.
S05E11,GEORGE,I know. This was the only woman I never lied to. Well thats not entirely true.
S05E11,JERRY,"Oh, whatever."
S05E11,ELAINE,"Mmm, this is delicious."
S05E11,JERRY,"Mmm, succulent."
S05E11,GEORGE,"She knew I didnt have a job, she knew I lived at home. Didnt seem to bother her. I think I could have married this woman."
S05E11,ELAINE,Why dont you just ask her parents?
S05E11,GEORGE,"I cant. I met them. Theyre devout. You know, in the cab on the way over here, I actually thought about converting."
S05E11,JERRY,To Latvian Orthodox?
S05E11,GEORGE,Why not? What do I care?
S05E11,JERRY,You know its not like changing toothpaste.
S05E11,ELAINE,I think it would be romantic.
S05E11,GEORGE,Really?
S05E11,ELAINE,"Yeah, its like Edward the Eighth abdicating the throne and marrying Mrs. Simpson. Ooh."
S05E11,GEORGE,"King Edward. (snapping his fingers) King Edward, Jerry."
S05E11,JERRY,Yeah well King Edward didnt live in Queens with Frank and Estelle Costanza.
S05E11,GEORGE,You know what? I could probably do this. Whats the difference.
S05E11,ELAINE,George I was just kidding around.
S05E11,GEORGE,No. I wouldnt even have to tell her. I could surprise her.
S05E11,ELAINE,George I wasnt serious.
S05E11,GEORGE,"How hard could it be? You make a little contribution, you have a ceremony. I am going to think about this. I am really going to think about this."
S05E11,ELAINE,I guess this one is my fault.
S05E11,JERRY,Oh yeah.
S05E11,TAWNI,"(kiss, kiss, kiss) Oh that was nice. Have you always been such a good kisser?"
S05E11,JERRY,"Oh I dont know. Not always. No I uh I had to work at it. When I was a kid all the kids would be out playing, I would be up in my room practicing my kissing."
S05E11,TAWNI,Well it was worth it. (kiss) Ill be (kiss) right (kiss) back (kiss). Where are you going?
S05E11,JERRY,To wash my hands. Theyre sticky from the orange.
S05E11,TAWNI,Meet you back here?
S05E11,JERRY,Right there.
S05E11,JERRY,"(thinking to himself; picks up a tube) ""Fungicide"". Fungus?"
S05E11,JERRY,Fungicide. I mean what could she have?
S05E11,ELAINE,I dont know.
S05E11,KRAMER,Fungus.
S05E11,JERRY,Exactly
S05E11,ELAINE,So what did you say?
S05E11,JERRY,I said I was coming down with the flu or something and I had to go home.
S05E11,ELAINE,"I don't know, what were you doing opening her medicine cabinet?"
S05E11,JERRY,I didnt open it. It was open. I just nudged it a little.
S05E11,ELAINE,You were snooping.
S05E11,JERRY,I was not snooping. I did not break the seal. There was no breaking and entering. I wouldnt do that.
S05E11,KRAMER,I would. I always open medicine cabinets.
S05E11,ELAINE,Well I trust people not to do that.
S05E11,KRAMER,Big mistake.
S05E11,JERRY,Why dont you ask that doctor what it is?
S05E11,ELAINE,What? Now hes a doctor? Before he was a podiatrist.
S05E11,JERRY,But thats what podiatrists do. They deal in fungus. Theyre knee- deep in fungus. This guy knows fungus.
S05E11,ELAINE,I am not going to ask him about funguses.
S05E11,KRAMER,Fungi.
S05E11,JERRY,What?
S05E11,KRAMER,Fungi.
S05E11,FATHER-PRIEST,Why do you want to accept the Latvian Orthodox faith?
S05E11,GEORGE,"(ahem) In this age of uncertainty and confusion, a man begins to ask himself certain questions. How can one even begin to put into words something so um (trying to think of a word)"
S05E11,FATHER-PRIEST,Enigmatic?
S05E11,GEORGE,No.
S05E11,FATHER-PRIEST,"Vast? (he pronounces it as ""vost"")"
S05E11,GEORGE,"No not vast (he pronounces it as ""vost"")"
S05E11,FATHER-PRIEST,"Well whatever it is, basically you like the religion."
S05E11,GEORGE,Yes.
S05E11,FATHER-PRIEST 2,Is there one aspect of the faith that you find particularly attractive?
S05E11,GEORGE,(he thinks) I think the hats. The hat conveys that solemn religious look you want in a faith. Very pious.
S05E11,FATHER-PRIEST,Are you familiar with Orthodox theology?
S05E11,GEORGE,"Well perhaps, not to the extent that you are. But I know the basic plot. Yeah."
S05E11,FATHER-PRIEST,Plot?
S05E11,GEORGE,"Yes. You know the uh flood, and the uh lepers, and the commandments and all that."
S05E11,FATHER-PRIEST 2,Well its obvious that you are sincere in your desire.
S05E11,GEORGE,"Oh yes I am Father. Incredibly sincere. So, uh, pffft, am I in?"
S05E11,FATHER-PRIEST,The first step would be to familiarize yourself with these texts (brings out a pile of books).
S05E11,GEORGE,"Ah hah. You see Father, Im Im incredibly anxious to become a member. Um, dont you offer any kind of an express conversion? A quick change?"
S05E11,SISTER ROBERTA,"Oh Im sorry. Father, theres a man waiting in the chapel."
S05E11,FATHER-PRIEST,"You may attend to it Sister, oh this is George Costanza. He is interested in joining the church."
S05E11,SISTER ROBERTA,Oh are you? Thats wonderful. Well good luck to you.
S05E11,GEORGE,Nice nun.
S05E11,FATHER-PRIEST,"No, Sister Roberta is not a nun. She is what we call a novice."
S05E11,FATHER-PRIEST 2,She wont be taking her final vows until next Thursday.
S05E11,SISTER ROBERTA,May I help you?
S05E11,KRAMER,"Oh yeah, Im here to pick up my friend George Costanza."
S05E11,SISTER ROBERTA,Well hes in with the Father.
S05E11,KRAMER,Oh yeah.
S05E11,SISTER ROBERTA,Im Sister Roberta.
S05E11,KRAMER,Oh. Kramer. Pleasure.
S05E11,SISTER ROBERTA,Mine. (she smiles at Kramer)
S05E11,GEORGE,"I cant believe how easy it is. Im virtually Orthodox. All I have to do is read a few books, memorize a few prayers, and Im in the club."
S05E11,JERRY,Thats all there is to it.
S05E11,GEORGE,Thats all there is to it. By Christmas day I will be Brother Costanza.
S05E11,JERRY,And when is Brother Costanza planning on telling Mother Costanza?
S05E11,GEORGE,Brother Costanza will be taking the vow of silence.
S05E11,JERRY,Oh a slinky.
S05E11,KRAMER,Sister Roberta gave it to me.
S05E11,JERRY,Why did she give you that?
S05E11,KRAMER,I think she liked me.
S05E11,JERRY,What do you mean she liked you?
S05E11,KRAMER,Liked me.
S05E11,GEORGE,"Kramer, they like everybody. Theyre friendly people."
S05E11,KRAMER,No. I think I picked up on a vibe.
S05E11,JERRY,"You picked up on a vibe, from a nun."
S05E11,KRAMER,"Yeah, Jerry Im telling you I have this power. And I have no control over it."
S05E11,JERRY,Yea alright.
S05E11,KRAMER,"Oh, that's my phone."
S05E11,JERRY,Oh hi.
S05E11,TAWNI,"Hi, I just wanted to stop by and see how you were feeling."
S05E11,JERRY,(weakly) A little better. (fake cough)
S05E11,TAWNI,If you need anything let me know.
S05E11,JERRY,Okay.
S05E11,TAWNI,Okay.
S05E11,JERRY,All right.
S05E11,TAWNI,Bye.
S05E11,JERRY,Bye.
S05E11,GEORGE,Story.
S05E11,JERRY,Shes subletting Carols place for a month.
S05E11,GEORGE,"Yea, she likes you."
S05E11,JERRY,Yeah but theres a problem. I found a tube of a fungicide in her medicine cabinet.
S05E11,GEORGE,So?
S05E11,JERRY,So I dont know what shes using it for.
S05E11,GEORGE,Well how do you even know its hers? Maybe it belonged to Carol. Did you see a name on the tube?
S05E11,JERRY,I didnt even think to look.
S05E11,GEORGE,Well take a look. It might not even belong to her.
S05E11,JERRY,Yeah.
S05E11,GEORGE,People always leave old things in their medicine cabinet.
S05E11,JERRY,Yeah Ive got this old bottle of cough medicine.
S05E11,GEORGE,I still have brill cream.
S05E11,JERRY,Hi
S05E11,TAWNI,Hi.
S05E11,JERRY,Hi. Can I use your bathroom?
S05E11,ELAINE,You sure you dont mind?
S05E11,DOCTOR,No of course not. People ask me medical questions all the time.
S05E11,ELAINE,Well I mean the question isnt even for me its for a friend.
S05E11,DOCTOR,"Elaine, Im used to it. Im a doctor."
S05E11,ELAINE,Well podiatrist.
S05E11,DOCTOR,Huh?
S05E11,ELAINE,"No no, Im just saying you didnt really go to medical school, you went to podiatry school. Which Im sure is very grueling in its own way."
S05E11,DOCTOR,I went to podiatry school because I like feet. I chose to work with feet.
S05E11,ELAINE,I like feet too. Im just saying
S05E11,DOCTOR,Saying what?
S05E11,TAWNI,How are you doing in there?
S05E11,JERRY,"Fine all done, just looking for the soap."
S05E11,TAWNI,No soap?
S05E11,JERRY,No I dont see it.
S05E11,TAWNI,(giving Jerry the soap) Here you go.
S05E11,ESTELLE,George what are you doing in there?
S05E11,GEORGE,What? Nothing.
S05E11,FRANK,Youve been in there an hour.
S05E11,ESTELLE,You dont feel well?
S05E11,GEORGE,Im fine.
S05E11,ESTELLE,I want to know what youre doing in there.
S05E11,GEORGE,Nothing.
S05E11,FRANK,"George, open the door."
S05E11,GEORGE,No.
S05E11,ESTELLE,Georgie.
S05E11,GEORGE,No!
S05E11,KRAMER,Hey.
S05E11,SISTER ROBERTA,"Good evening. I hope Im not disturbing you, but I found another toy I thought you might like."
S05E11,JERRY,"Okay, Latvius was the son of which apostle? And Ill need that in the form of a question."
S05E11,GEORGE,I dont know. I cant believe theyre making me take this test.
S05E11,JERRY,"Hey, did you talk to the doctor?"
S05E11,ELAINE,No.
S05E11,JERRY,"All right, the next time you see him show him this. (He presents the bottle of fungicide.)"
S05E11,ELAINE,You took her medicine.
S05E11,JERRY,Not on purpose. I was hoping there would be a name on the tube. When are you seeing him again?
S05E11,ELAINE,I dont know. We got into this whole thing about how podiatrists arent real doctors.
S05E11,JERRY,How could you say that?
S05E11,ELAINE,Its you fault. You just got me thinking.
S05E11,JERRY,I was merely speaking extemporaneously.
S05E11,ELAINE,Ive got nothing against the foot. Im pro-foot.
S05E11,JERRY,Me too.
S05E11,ELAINE,Do you think I should call him and apologize?
S05E11,JERRY,Yes. Hes a doctor. (Elaine starts to leave. ) Wait a second. (Jerry puts the bottle of fungicide in Elaines purse.) (to George) What are you doing?
S05E11,GEORGE,What does it look like Im doing?
S05E11,JERRY,"(Reading words George wrote on his hand) ""Matthew, Luke, Paul"", what youre cheating on your conversion chest?"
S05E11,KRAMER,I told you.
S05E11,JERRY,What?
S05E11,KRAMER,I told you she liked me.
S05E11,JERRY,Who?
S05E11,KRAMER,Sister Roberta.
S05E11,JERRY,How do you know?
S05E11,KRAMER,She told me. She said shes never had a man stir up all of these feelings inside of her. Shes questioning her faith. Shes thinking of leaving the church.
S05E11,JERRY,Wow
S05E11,KRAMER,"Oh, uh, this power. Im dangerous Jerry, Im very very dangerous."
S05E11,FATHER-PRIEST,"I must say George, I was somewhat surprised at the results of your conversion test. I dont recall having seen such an impressive performance. You truly must be filled with the spirit of the Lord."
S05E11,GEORGE,"Oh, Im Im full of it Father."
S05E11,FATHER-PRIEST 2,(muttering something to Father-Priest 1) (mumble) Kramer (mumble)
S05E11,FATHER-PRIEST,"Yes, yes I see. (To George) Im sorry something has come up."
S05E11,GEORGE,"Oh, I understand. (George exits; Sees Kramer in the hallway) Hey."
S05E11,KRAMER,"(rushed) Yea, Hey. (Kramer enters.) Um, you wanted to see me Father?"
S05E11,FATHER-PRIEST,"Yes. Please, sit down. Sister Roberta came to see me yesterday."
S05E11,KRAMER,"I know what this is about Father. I didnt do anything. I just spoke to her innocently for just a few minutes. Its just that, that I have this power."
S05E11,FATHER-PRIEST,Yes. Kavorka.
S05E11,KRAMER,Kavorka?
S05E11,FATHER-PRIEST,"It is a Latvian word which means ""the lure of the animal""."
S05E11,KRAMER,I dont understand.
S05E11,FATHER-PRIEST,Women are drawn to you. They would give anything to be possessed by you.
S05E11,KRAMER,Help me Father. Help me.
S05E11,FATHER-PRIEST,"Yes, yes I will help you. Listen very carefully. I want you to buy ten cloves of garlic, three quarts of vinegar, six ounces"
S05E11,JERRY,What is that stench? I got it. (He follows the smell to Kramers door) Ah hah.
S05E11,KRAMER,Hey.
S05E11,JERRY,Hey. What are you doing?
S05E11,KRAMER,Ive got the Kavorka Jerry.
S05E11,JERRY,The Kavorka? Whats that?
S05E11,KRAMER,The lure of the animal. Im dangerous.
S05E11,JERRY,What is this thing around your neck?
S05E11,KRAMER,The priests theyre helping me. I just bathed in vinegar.
S05E11,JERRY,You know youre funcifying the whole building.
S05E11,KRAMER,Keep away Jerry. Keep away.
S05E11,JERRY,"Kramer. (knock, knock, knock) Kramer."
S05E11,[At the entrance of the church. There is a sign there. It reads,CONVERSION CEREMONY - FOR - GEORGE COSTANZA - 3P.M. The sign is on a black background with white stick-on letters.]
S05E11,WOMAN,George Costanza? Estelles son?
S05E11,ESTELLE,Latvian Orthodox? Why are you doing this?
S05E11,GEORGE,For a woman.
S05E11,FRANK,A woman? What are you out of your mind?
S05E11,ESTELLE,Why cant you do anything like a normal person?
S05E11,FRANK,Wait. Is this the group that goes around mutilating squirrels?
S05E11,GEORGE,No its a regular religion.
S05E11,FRANK,Im calling my lawyer. It might not be too late to get out of this.
S05E11,GEORGE,I dont want to get out of it.
S05E11,ESTELLE,"Bu George, you dont know what youre saying. Youre under their control."
S05E11,FRANK,"What, they brainwashed you?"
S05E11,GEORGE,No no.
S05E11,FRANK,Youre not performing any rituals in this house.
S05E11,ESTELLE,Go back to the psychiatrist. I beg you.
S05E11,FRANK,And stay away from those squirrels.
S05E11,TAWNI,Oh how you doing Jerry?
S05E11,JERRY,Good. Whats the matter?
S05E11,TAWNI,Im tired. I hardly slept last night with all this scratching. Bonkers was going crazy.
S05E11,JERRY,Bonkers?
S05E11,TAWNI,"My cat. Hes got this weird sort of skin condition. Some type of fungus, I couldnt find his medicine."
S05E11,JERRY,Oh its your cat!
S05E11,TAWNI,What?
S05E11,JERRY,"Ooh, nothing."

S05E11,FATHER-PRIEST,What did you say?
S05E11,GEORGE,What?
S05E11,FATHER-PRIEST,I thought you said faddah.
S05E11,GEORGE,"I said faddah, I meant Father. Just a little bit nervous."
S05E11,FATHER-PRIEST,"Ooh, of course."
S05E11,KRAMER,How you doing?
S05E11,WOMAN,Get away from me you creep. (She walks away.)
S05E11,KRAMER,"Yes, Yes. It worked. Sister Roberta Ive still got time to catch her."
S05E11,FATHER-PRIEST,Congratulations George. Welcome to the faith. Sister Roberta would you please offer the final benediction.
S05E11,SISTER ROBERTA,"(hesitates) I cant. (crowd murmurs) Im sorry. Its a beautiful religion, but I am not worthy of it. I found something else."
S05E11,SISTER ROBERTA,Him.
S05E11,CROWD,"Kavorka, Kavorka."
S05E11,ELAINE,"(kiss, kiss) You know, because I love the foot. Im a big fan of the foot."
S05E11,DOCTOR,Well its my fault. I got a little defensive.
S05E11,ELAINE,"And that pinkie toe, come on . How adorable is the pinkie toe."
S05E11,DOCTOR,Its my favorite toe.
S05E11,ELAINE,"Lets face it, you get a bunion, where are you going? Youre not going to the ear guy."
S05E11,DOCTOR,No youre not.
S05E11,ELAINE,Ill be right back.
S05E11,DOCTOR,"Oh uh, wheres the bathroom?"
S05E11,ELAINE,Its right down here to the left. I will uh meet you right back here.
S05E11,JERRY,Elaine its her cat. Her cat had the fungus. So I need the tube back.
S05E11,DOCTOR,"(Thinking to himself) ""Fungicide""? Fungus?"
S05E11,SISTER ROBERTA,Somethings wrong. I dont feel the same lure.
S05E11,KRAMER,You dont?
S05E11,SISTER ROBERTA,What have I? I must return to the church. By the way you really need to take a bath. You stink.
S05E11,KRAMER,Yeah yeah.
S05E11,JERRY,"But once you put medicine in your medicine cabinet you're never using it again. Any medicine you're using, is on the sink. It's not really even a medicine cabinet, it's really like an ointment museum isn't it? It's like here's a saff from 1983, some cream from the 70s. But you want to keep it private, because a medicine cabinet is a place that reveals our weaknesses and it can really throw off the balance between two people that might be going out. Somebody peeks in there, ""Oh I see Mr. Perfect needs tough actin' Tinactin. Well I guess I'll be calling the shots in this relationship from now on."""
S05E11,SASHA,For me?
S05E11,GEORGE,Well I didnt do it for my mother.
S05E11,SASHA,Im really flattered. But I just dont feel ready to make a commitment yet. Maybe when I get back from Latvia.
S05E11,GEORGE,Latvia?
S05E11,SASHA,Yes. Im going to stay with some relatives there for a year. Isnt it great?
S05E11,GEORGE,"Enjoy, enjoy."
S05E11,SASHA,"Oh George, you are so sweet. Dont ever change."
S05E11,GEORGE,Id like a doggie bag for this please. (hands her plate to the waitress)
S05E12,JERRY,The whale is supposed to be such an intelligent animal. You know you always here about how they can communicate by song from miles away. How extensive their vocabulary is. I would say from the rate we are pushing the whales off the beach back into the ocean the words shore and close do not appear to be in their vocabulary. I would say if the whales concentrate a little less on the singing and a little more on approaching Quervo beach volleyball tournament. If you wanna maintain the brainy mammal image.
S05E12,ELAINE,"Oh, I can't believe this. What a dope! uh..excuse me umm.. I'm sorry this is.. this is kind of embarrassing but.. there's no toilet paper over here"
S05E12,JANE,(from the stall on Elaine's right) Are you talking to me?
S05E12,ELAINE,yeah.. I I just forgot to check so if you could just spare me some.

S05E12,ELAINE,"well I don't need much, just 3 squares will do it"
S05E12,JANE,"I'm sorry I don't have a square to spare, now if you don't mind"
S05E12,ELAINE,3 squares? you can't spare 3 squares??
S05E12,JANE,"no I don't have a square to spare, I can't spare a square"
S05E12,ELAINE,"oh is it two-ply? cause it it's two-ply I'll take one ply, one ply, one puny little ply, I'll take one measly ply"
S05E12,JANE,"look, I don't have a square and I don't have a ply (flushing and leaving)"
S05E12,ELAINE,"No no, no no, don't don't, I beg you"
S05E12,JERRY,(eating pop corn) hmm I love this artificial flavoring I like it better than butter I think it's more consistent
S05E12,JANE,you would not believe what just happened to me in the bathroom
S05E12,JERRY,what?
S05E12,ELAINE,hey

S05E12,TONY,"my popcorn, you were supposed to get me popcorn what? would you forget about me babe?"
S05E12,ELAINE,you would not believe what just happened to me in the bathroom
S05E12,JANE,"I mean.. a person needs a certain amount of toilet paper to be covered.. I simply could not spare it this woman just didn't get it, she kept harassing me"
S05E12,ELAINE,3 squares!! that's all I was asking for! 3 squares!
S05E12,JANE,"she wouldn't stop ""help me! help me!"" she was insane"
S05E12,ELAINE,"I was begging her ""please! please!"" she was insane"
S05E12,JERRY,who do you think she is? how dare she? you want me to get the manager? too bad they don't have those old ladies walking around with flashlights anymore we'd flush her out
S05E12,JANE,I don't know what she looks like
S05E12,JERRY,I wonder where Elaine is sitting? I really wanted you to meet her she's supposed to be here tonight with her new boyfriend Tony
S05E12,ELAINE,hmm where is Jerry sitting? he's supposed to be here tonight with his new girlfriend I'm dying to see what she looks like
S05E12,TONY,hey? you think if I jumped off that balcony I'd get hurt?

S05E12,JERRY,"It's not one of those 976 calls, is it?"
S05E12,KRAMER,"look come on, let me use it, 5 minutes, I'll pay you back huh?"
S05E12,JERRY,why do you do that?

S05E12,JERRY,"well, you know, sometimes a square is everything"
S05E12,ELAINE,a ply?
S05E12,JERRY,"Elaine, you cannot judge a person on a situation like that. I mean it's like asking for someone's canteen in the desert"
S05E12,ELAINE,yeah
S05E12,JERRY,it's battle conditions

S05E12,JANE,what are you talking about?
S05E12,JERRY,"alright I changed my mind, uh yeah I don't think I'm not gonna go now"
S05E12,JANE,"well ok I'll see you later,"
S05E12,JERRY,Ok.

S05E12,KRAMER,that's her
S05E12,JERRY,who?
S05E12,KRAMER,"Erika, she's Erika"
S05E12,JERRY,"oh you think she's Erika, the phone sex woman"
S05E12,KRAMER,"Jerry, that voice is tattooed on my brain, I'm telling you it's her"
S05E12,JERRY,oh you're crazy
S05E12,KRAMER,Am I? Or am I so sane that you just blew your mind?
S05E12,JERRY,It's impossible
S05E12,KRAMER,iIs it? Or is it so possible your heard is spinning like a top?
S05E12,JERRY,it can't be
S05E12,KRAMER,Can't it? Or is your entire world just crashing down all around you?
S05E12,JERRY,alright that's enough
S05E12,KRAMER,yeaaaaah!
S05E12,ELAINE,he's supposed to get the bandages off on Sunday.. what if?
S05E12,JERRY,what?
S05E12,ELAINE,you know (acts like a monster)
S05E12,JERRY,oh you're afraid he might look like Zippy the pinhead
S05E12,ELAINE,"yeah I mean, I mean what is my obligation here, you know we were just dating, it was probably gonna be over in a couple of weeks anyway"
S05E12,JERRY,oh I though you didn't care about his looks
S05E12,ELAINE,I lied
S05E12,JERRY,aha
S05E12,ELAINE,"are you kidding, he's a mimbo I know that.. but he's my mimbo, you know and even if he is a hideous freak maybe, maybe I can learn to love him, maybe in some final irony (Jerry is looking the other way), I'll learn what love really is. You know Jerry"
S05E12,JERRY,oh I'm sorry I didn't get most of that.. isn't that Kramer over there?
S05E12,ELAINE,"yeah, yeah"
S05E12,JERRY,hey Kramer
S05E12,KRAMER,what? hey (walks by Jerry and Elaine's table) it's all set
S05E12,JERRY,what's all set?
S05E12,KRAMER,"Erika is gonna meet me here, now we're gonna find out the truth"
S05E12,JERRY,how's you get her to meet here?
S05E12,KRAMER,"I don't know, we have a certain chemistry"
S05E12,JERRY,oh my god
S05E12,JANE,hi I thought I'd find you here
S05E12,JERRY,hello.. Erika
S05E12,JANE,Erika? what are you talking about?
S05E12,JERRY,how can u say things like that over the phone?
S05E12,JANE,what things? What are you talking about?
S05E12,JERRY,selling sexual pleasure over the phone?
S05E12,JANE,I sell paper goods you jerk
S05E12,JERRY,paper goods?
S05E12,ELAINE,"excuse me, do you have a tissue?"
S05E12,JANE,"No, I'm sorry, I can't spare it, there's not enough to spare"
S05E12,JANE,Where's the ladies' room (Kramer points her)
S05E12,ELAINE,I have to go to the bathroom too (runs to be ahead of Jane; Jane stops and looks back at Jerry; Jerry shugs)
S05E12,[monk's,the bathroom]
S05E12,JANE,oh damn
S05E12,ELAINE,something.. wrong?
S05E12,JANE,"yeah there's no toilet paper in here, I usually check but would you mind?"
S05E12,ELAINE,"I can't, I don't have it, I don't have a square to spare, I can't spare a square"
S05E12,JANE,"Hey, wait a minute, I know you"
S05E12,ELAINE,"that's right honey, and I know you!"
S05E12,JANE,"no, no, no!!!"
S05E12,ELAINE,"here, take it"
S05E12,JERRY,thanks
S05E12,JANE,"(walks out of the bathroom, very furious; to Jerry) don't call me anymore"
S05E12,JANE,"(to Kramer, in a very sensual voice) you either"
S05E12,JERRY,"Now of the course the thing is Extreme sports. Bungie jumping. To me if Bungie jumping is a sport so is being a crash test dummy. Just leaning does not make it a sport. It's like a Wiley Coyote idea isn't it? The thing I wonder about the sky diving is why do they even bother with the helmets? Can you almost make it? Why don't they just wear a party hat? What's the difference? You jump out of a plane from twenty thousand feet in the air the chute doesn't open I got news for you, the helmet is now wearing you for protection. Later on the helmet's talking to the other helmets going ""boy it's a good thing he was there or I would have hit the ground directly."""
S05E13,ELAINE,"Hey, do you believe I got Happy New Yeared today? It's February."
S05E13,JERRY,I once got Happy New Yeared in March.
S05E13,ELAINE,It's disgusting.
S05E13,JERRY,"It's pathetic. . . . hey, is it cold out?"
S05E13,ELAINE,Really cold.
S05E13,JERRY,Scary cold.
S05E13,ELAINE,I don't know. What's your definition of scary cold?
S05E13,JERRY,That. (pointing at George)
S05E13,ELAINE,"(Laughing as she says it) What is that, ha?"
S05E13,GEORGE,What?
S05E13,JERRY,When did you get that?
S05E13,GEORGE,This week. My father got a deal from a friend of his. It's Gore-Tex. You know about Gore-Tex?
S05E13,JERRY,"You like saying Gore-Tex, don't you?"
S05E13,ELAINE,"Hey, you can't even turn around in that thing."
S05E13,JERRY,Look at this
S05E13,ELAINE,"Hey George, can you feel this? Can you ..."
S05E13,GEORGE,"All right, all right. KNOCK IT OFF. Come on, let's go."
S05E13,ELAINE,Oh listen we should stop off on the way and get a bottle of wine or something.
S05E13,JERRY,Yeah. (pointing at Elaine as he goes into the bedroom)
S05E13,GEORGE,What for?
S05E13,ELAINE,These people invited us for dinner. We have to bring something.
S05E13,GEORGE,Why?
S05E13,ELAINE,"Because it's rude, otherwise."
S05E13,GEORGE,"You mean just going there because I'm invited, that's rude?"
S05E13,ELAINE,Yes.
S05E13,GEORGE,"So you're telling me instead of them being happy to see me, they're going to be upset because I didn't bring anything. Ttst --You see what I'm saying?"
S05E13,JERRY,The fabric of society is very complex George.
S05E13,GEORGE,I don't even drink wine. I drink Pepsi.
S05E13,ELAINE,Ya can't bring Pepsi. (Elaine starts putting on her coat and gloves)
S05E13,GEORGE,Why not?
S05E13,ELAINE,Because we're adults?
S05E13,GEORGE,"You telling me that wine is better than Pepsi? Huh (snort), no way wine is better than Pepsi."
S05E13,JERRY,"I tell you George, I don't think we want to walk in there and put a big plastic jug of Pepsi in the middle of the table."
S05E13,GEORGE,I just don't like the idea that any time theres a dinner invitation there's this annoying little chore that goes along with it.
S05E13,JERRY,"You know, you're getting to be an annoying little chore yourself."
S05E13,KRAMER,"All right, let's go. Who's driving? (claps his hands and rubs them together)"
S05E13,JERRY,You are. I can't get that thing in my car. (referring to George)
S05E13,KRAMER,Uh huh.
S05E13,JERRY,"Where's the heat in this car? Come on Elaine warm me up, oh! I'm cold. Just give me a little squeeze."
S05E13,ELAINE,"Jerry get off of me. Get off of ME! Get off, Get off of Me!"
S05E13,GEORGE,"Hehehehehe (higher tone laugh, though still quietly )"
S05E13,JERRY,"You're pretty comfortable up there eh, Bubble boy?"
S05E13,GEORGE,"Oh, yeah. You wish you had this coat."
S05E13,ELAINE,"You know, I was just thinking. The four of us can't show up with just one bottle of wine."
S05E13,GEORGE,"Oh, here we go..."
S05E13,ELAINE,What?
S05E13,GEORGE,Why don't we get them a couch? (Kramer laughs) Well rent a U-haul -- well bring em a nice sectional.
S05E13,KRAMER,(low tone)Yeahhehehehe
S05E13,ELAINE,We should bring some cake. Will you stop off at the bakery?
S05E13,KRAMER,"(low tone) All right, yeah."
S05E13,GEORGE,Why don't you just get some Ring Dings from the liquor store?
S05E13,ELAINE,Ring Dings?
S05E13,GEORGE,"Hey, Ring Dings are better than anything you're gonna get at a bakery."
S05E13,KRAMER,Ooooh I like Ring Dings.
S05E13,ELAINE,"George, we can't show up at someone's house with Ring Dings and Pepsi."
S05E13,KRAMER,HEY YOUR LIGHTS ARE ON! (shouting out the window)
S05E13,GEORGE,"(to Kramer) It's a funeral procession. . . . (to Elaine) And I got news for you. I show up with Ring Dings and Pepsi, I become the biggest hit of the party. People be coming up to me, ""just between you and me I'm really excited about the Ring Dings and the Pepsi. What are we, Europeans with the Beaujolais and Chardonnay . . ."
S05E13,ELAINE,"Oh, Kramer, thats the bakery. Stop here. Stop here."
S05E13,KRAMER,(low tone) All right.
S05E13,ELAINE,"Okay, let me out. You, eh, whatever your name is"
S05E13,JERRY,Jerry.
S05E13,ELAINE,"Yeah, Jerry, Jerry -- come with me."
S05E13,KRAMER,"Okay, so we're going to get the wine and we'll pick you up here in ten minutes."
S05E13,ELAINE,Yeah.
S05E13,KRAMER,All right
S05E13,ELAINE,"Ummm, I love the smell of bakeries."
S05E13,JERRY,"Mmm. Oh look Elaine, the black and white cookie."
S05E13,ELAINE,Mmm.
S05E13,JERRY,I love the black and white. Two races of flavor living side by side in harmony. It's a wonderful thing isn't it?
S05E13,ELAINE,You know I often wonder what you'll be like when you're senile.
S05E13,JERRY,I'm looking forward to it.
S05E13,ELAINE,Yeah. I think it will be a very smooth transition for you.
S05E13,JERRY,"Thank you. All right, look at all this stuff. What are we getting'?"
S05E13,ELAINE,CHOCOLATE BABKA! That's their specialty.
S05E13,JERRY,Love that babka.
S05E13,ELAINE,"Yeah, yeah!"
S05E13,JERRY,"So listen Elaine, when we get up to the door, you , you hold the cake box."
S05E13,ELAINE,Why?
S05E13,JERRY,"I don't know, just standing there with a box, holding it by the little string."
S05E13,ELAINE,You think it's effeminate?
S05E13,JERRY,It's a tad dainty.
S05E13,ELAINE,"Oh, we forgot to pick a number."
S05E13,JERRY,"Oh, see that's not fair. We-We were here ahead of all these people."
S05E13,ELAINE,I-cu-di-ge--You think I should go and ask her for hers?
S05E13,JERRY,"Ah, no, forget it."
S05E13,ELAINE,"No, no no no, no it's not fair. Just because they have a ticket doesn't mean they were here first. We were here, and we were ahead of them, and them, and her. Come on let's just go ask em. Come on. . . . Excuse me."
S05E13,KRAMER,"(exhales) Well, I'm not finding a spot here. What do you want to do?"
S05E13,GEORGE,"Ah, Just double park."
S05E13,KRAMER,"No, no."
S05E13,GEORGE,Why not?
S05E13,KRAMER,"I'll get a ticket! Besides, what if somebody wants to get out of here?"
S05E13,GEORGE,"Are you kidding? People get spaces this good, they never give em up."
S05E13,KRAMER,That's a fallacy.
S05E13,GEORGE,"All right, I'll tell you what... why don't you go into the store and I'll wait in the car?"
S05E13,KRAMER,Why don't YOU go into the store and I'LL wait in the car?
S05E13,GEORGE,"Because, I've got the coat. I can sit in the car and not get cold."
S05E13,KRAMER,So what I'm going to leave the car running and the heat 'll be on.
S05E13,GEORGE,Does the heater even work in this car?
S05E13,KRAMER,No.
S05E13,GEORGE,"Oh, Hey, eh, there's a spot right in front of the liquor store. You see"
S05E13,KRAMER,I see.
S05E13,GEORGE,"You see, hu, ho ho."
S05E13,ELAINE,But we were here ahead of you.
S05E13,BARBARA,How do I know that?
S05E13,JERRY,Well we saw you come in.
S05E13,DAVID,"Well, that's easy for you to say."
S05E13,ELAINE,"Oh, yeah, right, that's something I do all the time, right. I make up stories to get ahead in lines at bakeries."
S05E13,CLERK,46?
S05E13,ELAINE,"Wait, wait a second are, are you Barbara Benedict?"
S05E13,BARBARA,Yes.
S05E13,ELAINE,"Oh my god. I, I know you. I-Im, I'm Elaine Benes. Do you remember we met at Linda van Grak's baby shower."
S05E13,BARBARA,I'm on my way over there right now.
S05E13,ELAINE,Yeah me too.
S05E13,DAVID,You're Jerry right?
S05E13,JERRY,David!
S05E13,ELAINE,"Well, this is a little awkward, isn't it?"
S05E13,BARBARA,Yes it is.
S05E13,ELAINE,"You know we were here, ahead of you."
S05E13,BARBARA,You're NOT getting my number.
S05E13,JERRY,Oh so you still don't believe us.
S05E13,CLERK,47!
S05E13,BARBARA,Thats Us.
S05E13,ELAINE,"Ohhh, OK, fine, fine, go ahead. But listen let me tell you something as soon as I get there I'm going to tell everyone what a jerk you are."
S05E13,BARBARA,"Well, I'll be there ahead of you and I'LL be telling them what a jerk YOU are. . . . (turns to the counter) I'll have the chocolate babka."
S05E13,CLERK,You're lucky Mrs. Benedict it's our last one.
S05E13,GEORGE,"Alright, what are we getting? It's hot in here!"
S05E13,KRAMER,"Ooo, What do you say we get a Mouton Cadet?"
S05E13,GEORGE,What's that?
S05E13,KRAMER,"Well its a Bordeaux. Robust, bold, very dry. As opposed to a Beaujolais -- which is richer and fruitier. Ahh, here's one. Twelve dollars."
S05E13,GEORGE,Twelve dollars? I knew we should have gone to the bakery. I guarantee you theyre not getting no twelve dollar cake.
S05E13,KRAMER,"All right look, I am going to have to pay you back later. I don't have my wallet."
S05E13,GEORGE,. . . Why not?
S05E13,KRAMER,Because I don't like to carry my wallet. My Osteopath says that it's bad for my spine. It throws my hips off kilter. (makes a motion with his hips)
S05E13,GEORGE,"""throws your hips off kilter"" So where's your money? (pulls out his wallet)"
S05E13,KRAMER,I never take it.
S05E13,GEORGE,So what do you do?
S05E13,KRAMER,"Oh, I get by."
S05E13,BARBARA,See you later (exits with the babka)
S05E13,ELAINE & JERRY,See you later.
S05E13,JERRY,That's the last babka. They got the last babka.
S05E13,ELAINE,I know. They're going in first with the last babka.
S05E13,JERRY,That was our babka.
S05E13,ELAINE,You can't beat a babka.
S05E13,JERRY,We had that babka.
S05E13,ELAINE,(exhales) They're going to be heroes.
S05E13,JERRY,Well what are we going to do now. If we can't get the babka the whole thing's useless.
S05E13,ELAINE,Well how about a carrot cake?
S05E13,JERRY,Carrot cake? Now w-why is that a cake? You don't make carrots into a cake. I'm sorry.
S05E13,ELAINE,Black Forrest?
S05E13,JERRY,"Black Forrest? Too scary. You're in the Forrest, oohh."
S05E13,JERRY,How about a Napoleon?
S05E13,ELAINE,Napoleon? Who's he to have a cake? He was a ruthless war monger. Might as well get Mengele.
S05E13,JERRY,That was our babka. We had that babka!
S05E13,ELAINE,What's this one?
S05E13,CLERK,"That, Cinnamon Babka."
S05E13,ELAINE,(gasp)
S05E13,JERRY,Another babka?
S05E13,CLERK,There's chocolate and there's cinnamon.
S05E13,JERRY,Well-well we got to get the cinnamon.
S05E13,ELAINE,"No, but they got the chocolate. We'll be going in with lesser babka."
S05E13,JERRY,"I beg your pardon? Cinnamon takes a back seat to no babka. People love cinnamon. It should be on tables in restaurants along with salt and pepper. Anytime anyone says, ""Oh This is so good. What's in it?"" The answer invariably comes back, Cinnamon. Cinnamon. Again and again. Lesser babka - I think not."
S05E13,CLERK,49?
S05E13,ELAINE,I'll have a cinnamon babka.
S05E13,JERRY,"and a black and white cookie, for me. Peace!"
S05E13,CLERK,Thatll be 13.05
S05E13,GEORGE,All right here you go.
S05E13,KRAMER,Yeuu.
S05E13,CLERK,A hundred? I can't change that.
S05E13,GEORGE,"You can't - huhu, All right let's go."
S05E13,KRAMER,Wait a second. I can get change.
S05E13,KRAMER,"Hey, anybody got change for a hundred?"
S05E13,GEORGE,Are you crazy?! What are you doing?! You'll get us killed!
S05E13,KRAMER,What?
S05E13,GEORGE,Don't go shouting we got a hundred dollar bill. People will be jumping out of windows on top of us.
S05E13,KRAMER,"Alright, Let's go but something. Then we'll get some change."
S05E13,GEORGE,I am not buying something just to get change.
S05E13,KRAMER,"George, there's a news stand right over there. Now come on."
S05E13,GEORGE,"All right, what are we doing?"
S05E13,KRAMER,Just get some gum or something.
S05E13,GEORGE,Pack of gum. Here you go. (hands the clerk a $100 bill)
S05E13,CLERK,What is it a hundred? I can't change a hundred.
S05E13,GEORGE,Why not?
S05E13,CLERK,You got to buy more than that.
S05E13,KRAMER,"Here, get a newspaper. (Kramer hands George a Newspaper)"
S05E13,GEORGE,Newspaper.
S05E13,CLERK,Not enough.
S05E13,KRAMER,Clark Bar. (Kramer starts tearing the candy wrapper open with his teeth.)
S05E13,GEORGE,Clark Bar.
S05E13,CLERK,Keep going.
S05E13,GEORGE,Were up to two dollars here.
S05E13,KRAMER,"Here, George, get a Penthouse Forum."
S05E13,GEORGE,I'm not getting a Penthouse Forum.
S05E13,KRAMER,"Why? No, thatll make great dinner party conversation. We'll read the letters at the dinner table."
S05E13,GEORGE,"Oh, that's nice."
S05E13,KRAMER,"Come on, did you ever read one of these?"
S05E13,GEORGE,It's not real. They're all made up.
S05E13,KRAMER,"Ohh, it's real."
S05E13,GEORGE,"Well you know there is an unusual number of people in this country having sex with AMPUTEES! (grabs the forum from Kramer and walks over to the clerk) . . . Penthouse forum, newspaper, gum, Clark Bar."
S05E13,CLERK,6.75.
S05E13,GEORGE,"Ah, great. All right, with the wine I'm in over twenty dollars now."
S05E13,KRAMER,"All right, all right."
S05E13,MAN1,(gibberish Arabic yelling) ...Big Coat! Big Coat!
S05E13,GEORGE,"Yes, Im Sorry, it's a new coat. It-it's Gore-Tex."
S05E13,KRAMER,You better be careful with that thing... You'll start a war.
S05E13,JERRY,"Uhm, see the key to eating a Black and White cookie, Elaine, is you want to get some black and some white in each bite. Nothing mixes better than, vanilla and chocolate. And yet still somehow racial harmony eludes us. If people would only *Look to the Cookie* -- all our problems would be solved."
S05E13,ELAINE,"Well your views on race relations are just, fascinating. You really should do an Op-Ed piece for the Times. (Op-Ed stands for Opinions and Editorials)"
S05E13,JERRY,Hmm. Look to the cookie Elaine... Look to the cookie.
S05E13,ELAINE,(looking in the box) Well what is this?
S05E13,JERRY,What?
S05E13,ELAINE,It's a hair.
S05E13,JERRY,"Oh, oh take it back. Let's get another one."
S05E13,ELAINE,"No, we're late as it is. I'll just take it off."
S05E13,JERRY,"No no come on really, get another one. Itll take a second."
S05E13,ELAINE,"Alright, alright."
S05E13,ELAINE,Excuse me.
S05E13,Man,"Hey hey, I'm on line here."
S05E13,ELAINE,"No noo no, we just bought this. . . . Um, you sold us a cake with a (quietly) hair on it."
S05E13,CLERK,You have to take a number.
S05E13,ELAINE,We waited fifteen minutes for this. Tst - YOU SELL ME A CAKE WITH A HAIR ON IT. Then you want me to wait? . . . What are you doing (to Jerry taking a number) youre gonna wait now?
S05E13,JERRY,"Well, I'm not going to eat a cake with a hair on it."
S05E13,ELAINE,Well it was a little hair. I took it off.
S05E13,JERRY,A little hair? Do you think that makes it better?
S05E13,ELAINE,What if it's your hair?
S05E13,JERRY,What if it's your hair?
S05E13,ELAINE,(Wh-wh) What is wrong with my hair? Nobody takes better care of their hair than me. You can serve dinner on my head.
S05E13,JERRY,"Who needs that misty herbal rain water crap they sell in the health food store. I use Prell, the hard stuff. Hundred proof - takes your roots out. (pretends to pull hair out)"
S05E13,ELAINE,"Okay, fine, we'll just wait until she calls the number."
S05E13,JERRY,"Well, maybe we should just forget about the cake?"
S05E13,ELAINE,No I'm bringing cake! (looking worried and apprehensive)
S05E13,GEORGE,All right we got the wine. Aren't we lucky? We got wine. Whoopee Whoa! Imagine if we didn't bring the wine. We'd be shunned by society. Outcasts! WHERE'S YOUR WINE? GET OUT!
S05E13,KRAMER,"(reading from the Penthouse Forum) ""I know this is going to sound like a crazy fantasy but every word of this story is true"" (exits to street) "" A few weeks ago my girlfriend happened to mention to me how attractive she thought our new neighbor Linda was"""
S05E13,GEORGE,L-Look at this?
S05E13,KRAMER,Ahh.
S05E13,GEORGE,"Somebody double parked and blocked us in. D-DOES ANYBODY KNOW WHOSE CAR THAT IS? Maybe there's a note on it. Ohh-oh brother. No, no note. Can you believe this?"
S05E13,KRAMER,"""well of course I noticed it too with those cannibal breasts and pouty lips. I don't have to tell you she was a knock out."" (turns the page)"
S05E13,GEORGE,I really can not comprehend how stupid people could be sometimes. Can you comprehend it?
S05E13,KRAMER,"No, no I can't comprehend it?"
S05E13,GEORGE,I mean we can put a man on the moon but we're still basically very stupid. The guy who's car this is? He could be one of the guys that built the rocket. You see what I'm saying?
S05E13,KRAMER,"Well yeah, yeah. He could build the rocket, but-but he's still stupid for double-parking and blocking somebody in."
S05E13,GEORGE,So you really understand my point about building a rocket and double-parking.
S05E13,KRAMER,"Yeah, on one hand he's smart with rockets and on the other hand he's dumb with parking. . . . It's cold out here huh?"
S05E13,GEORGE,Maybe it's not even stupidity. Maybe it's just a blatant disregard for basic human decency. Yeah this how dictator's start. Do you think Mussolini would circle the block six times looking for a spot?
S05E13,KRAMER,"How about Idi Amin, huh?"
S05E13,GEORGE,"Ill tell you, if I was running for office I would ask for the death penalty for double-parkers. If this is allowed to go on this is not a society. THIS IS ANARCHY!"
S05E13,KRAMER,Are those shoes comfortable?
S05E13,GEORGE,No not really.
S05E13,KRAMER,Cause they look comfortable.
S05E13,GEORGE,I know that's why I bought `em but they're not comfortable.
S05E13,ELAINE,Why couldn't we just take the hair off and go?
S05E13,JERRY,No. Thats out of the question.
S05E13,ELAINE,Whhhy?
S05E13,JERRY,Because I had a bad experience with a hair when I was younger.
S05E13,ELAINE,What happened?
S05E13,JERRY,I'd rather not talk about it.
S05E13,ELAINE,You can't tell me?
S05E13,JERRY,All right . . . . I once found a hair in my Farina and I freaked out.
S05E13,(*Farina,"A meal or flour obtained chiefly from cereals, nuts, potatoes or Indian Corn, and used as a breakfast food.)"
S05E13,ELAINE,You found a hair in your Farina?
S05E13,JERRY,Yeah.
S05E13,CLERKS VOICE (off camera),56
S05E13,ELAINE,What happened?
S05E13,JERRY,"Well I started screaming, ""There's a hair in my farina. There's a hair in my farina."" Then I ran out of the house and I was running and running. And like I was little but I could run very fast. And I-I just kept running (In the background -- CLERKS VOICE 57) and they found me like three hours later collapsed at a construction site."
S05E13,ELAINE,(quietly) Wow. Who's hair was it?
S05E13,JERRY,My mother's.
S05E13,ELAINE,(quietly) Ahhhhh
S05E13,CLERK,58!
S05E13,ELAINE,"Ooo, That's us. (hits Jerry in the arm)"
S05E13,JERRY,"Oh, good."
S05E13,ELAINE,You sold us a hair with a cake around it. We'd like another one.
S05E13,CLERK,"(coughing and coughing, getting really bad)"
S05E13,JERRY,"Oh, that's lovely."
S05E13,ELAINE,"Ah,"
S05E13,JERRY,"Thats what you want to see, yeah. . . . Yeah, you want to trade your hair for some phlegm."
S05E13,JERRY,"Yeah thats a good deal -- you win the Pennant with that trade, hair for phlegm."
S05E13,CLERK,Here you are. (hands Elaine the cake box)
S05E13,ELAINE,Okay. Alright we got the cake now. Where is George and Kramer?
S05E13,KRAMER,"HEY DOUBLE-PARKER! (honk, honk) SHOW YOURSELF. (honk, honk) COME ON OUT, IM FREEZING! (honk, honk)"
S05E13,GEORGE,We are really late now. We're in big trouble. Big trouble.
S05E13,KRAMER,Why?
S05E13,GEORGE,You know -- Elaine.
S05E13,KRAMER,What about her?
S05E13,GEORGE,. . . I'm a little scared of her.
S05E13,KRAMER,You're scared of Elaine?
S05E13,GEORGE,Yes!
S05E13,KRAMER,Why?
S05E13,GEORGE,"Did you ever see her lose her temper. I was once late cause I bought a Panama hat -- she grabbed it by the brim, pulled it down so hard my head came right through the top of it."
S05E13,KRAMER,"Hey, let's go inside the liquor store. Im freezin in here."
S05E13,GEORGE,Why didn't you just wear a heavier coat?
S05E13,KRAMER,Because I wanted to look good for the party.
S05E13,GEORGE,"Oh, Hey, hey, hey! That's great! That's very nice. You know we've been waiting twenty minutes for you people?! What do you think, you're Mussolini?!"
S05E13,MAN2,"Back off *Puff Ball* it's not my car! (shoving Georges shoulder, he turns and walks away)"
S05E13,GEORGE,I wasn't talking to you.
S05E13,ELAINE,"Wait `til I get my hands on that George. I am gonna *pull* that big hood over his little head... tie the strings, and suffocate. You remember that Panama hat? That was nothing."
S05E13,JERRY,"Huh, wa?"
S05E13,ELAINE,What's the matter with you?
S05E13,JERRY,"I dont know, I don't feel so good."
S05E13,ELAINE,What's wrong?
S05E13,JERRY,"My stomach, I , think it was that cookie."
S05E13,ELAINE,The black and white?
S05E13,JERRY,Yeah.
S05E13,ELAINE,Not getting along?
S05E13,JERRY,I think I got David Duke and Farrakhan down there.
S05E13,ELAINE,(mocking - in a dopey voice) Well if we can't look to the cookie where can we look?
S05E13,JERRY,Oh my stomach. I feel like I'm going to throw up.
S05E13,ELAINE,"Wait, what about your vomit streak?"
S05E13,JERRY,"I know, I haven't thrown up since June 29th, 1980."
S05E13,ELAINE,"Oh, oh! Ooh my god. Oh!"
S05E13,MAN3,Sooory.
S05E13,ELAINE,"Sorry? You almost took my toe off. Why don't you watch what you're doing you, LUNATIC! (the man turns and walks away)"
S05E13,ELAINE,"(cont) ...uh, Jerry, I think he broke my toe. (Jerry gets up) W-Where're you going?"
S05E13,JERRY,Fourteen years down the drain. (points and walks off -- to the bathroom)
S05E13,GEORGE,Do you think chickens have individual personalities?
S05E13,KRAMER,(shivering) I don't know.
S05E13,GEORGE,"If you had like five chickens could you tell them apart by just the way they acted? Or would they all just be walking around? Bak, bak, baak, bak? Cause if they have individual personalities Im not sure we should be eaten `em. What's the matter with you?"
S05E13,KRAMER,(shivering gibberish) Waj cha jia ja
S05E13,CLERK,Can I help you guys with anything?
S05E13,GEORGE,"Oh, no no no -- We bought the wine here before, but now, you know we're bl-blocked in by some car double parked and we're just waiting for the guy to pull out."
S05E13,CLERK,Well wait outside. This isn't a hangout.
S05E13,GEORGE,But my friend here has hypothermia.
S05E13,KRAMER,(shivering) Hypothermia.
S05E13,CLERK,"All right guys, take it outside."
S05E13,CLERK,You're paying for these.
S05E13,ELAINE,How was it?
S05E13,JERRY,As good as it gets.
S05E13,GEORGE,"You know that coat was Gore-Tex. Its worth a hell of a lot more than that, cheap Chardonnay."
S05E13,KRAMER,(shivering) You know I'm freezin. Im definitely freezin. I can't stop shaking.
S05E13,GEORGE,I'm cold too. At least you've got a coat. Let's get in the car.
S05E13,KRAMER,(quietly) L-l (look)
S05E13,GEORGE,"Oh, my god that's Saddam Hussein. The dictator."
S05E13,MAN4,I wouldn't walk around without a coat in this weather; you'll catch your death of cold. So long. (waves to George and Kramer as they wave back at him.)
S05E13,CLERK,Can I getca anything else?
S05E13,JERRY,"Oh, no thanks."
S05E13,CLERK,"How about a nice box of ""scram""."
S05E13,GEORGE,"S-s-somebody double parked, we couldn't help it. It might have been Saddam Hussein, we're not really sure. He eh, had a British accent though."
S05E13,GEORGE,"What, what happened to you?"
S05E13,ELAINE,Somebody put a cane on my foot. Just like the one I'm going to put up your...
S05E13,JERRY,"Hey, what happened to your coat? And what is the smell? Is-ya, What are you drunk?"
S05E13,GEORGE,I had to give it to the liquor store guy.
S05E13,JERRY,What for?
S05E13,GEORGE,"I spilled some Chardonnay. So, what did you get?"
S05E13,ELAINE,Cinnamon babka.
S05E13,GEORGE,Cinnamon? Why didn't cha get chocolate?
S05E13,JERRY,George!
S05E13,ELAINE,"Here, here's your cake. (just about tosses it at the woman)"
S05E13,GEORGE,And your wine.
S05E13,ELAINE,See ya'.
S05E13,JERRY,See ya'.
S05E14,JERRY,"I love these nature shows, Ill watch and kind of nature show, and its amazing how you can always relate, to whatever theyre talking about. You know like youre watching the African Dung Beetle and youre going Boy, his life is a lot like mine. And you always root for whichever animal is the star of the show that week -- like if its the antelope, and theres a lion chasing the antelope you go, Run antelope Run! Use your Speed, Get away! But the next week its the lion, and then you go Get the antelope, eat him, bite his head! -- Trap him, dont let him use his speed!"
S05E14,ELAINE,(to the phone) Well did he bring it up in the meeting?
S05E14,JERRY,"Elaine, see this T-shirt, six years I've had this T-shirt. It's my best one, I call him Golden Boy."
S05E14,ELAINE,"Yeah, I'm on the phone here."
S05E14,JERRY,Golden Boys always the first shirt I wear out of the laundry. Here... touch Golden Boy!
S05E14,ELAINE,"No thanks. (to the phone) Yeah, Yeah I'll hold."
S05E14,JERRY,"But see look at the collar, it's fraying. Golden Boy is slowly dying. Each wash brings him one step closer, that's what makes the T-shirt such a tragic figure."
S05E14,ELAINE,Why don't you just let Golden Boy soak in the sink with some Woolight?
S05E14,JERRY,"No!!! The reason he's the iron man is because he goes out there and plays every game. Wash!!! Spin!!! Rinse!!! Spin!!! You take that away from him, you break his spirit!"
S05E14,ELAINE,"(to the phone)Yeah. Oh! What? He is! Oh! thats fantastic! I'm so excited! Yes I'm excited, OK, OK I'll be in soon! yeah, yeah, I'm coming, I'm coming! OK bye. (Elaine jumps up and dances around) Yuri Testikov, the Russian writer!"
S05E14,JERRY,The guy whos in the gulag?!
S05E14,ELAINE,"Yeah! Pendant's publishing his new book, and I'm working on it! Lippman and I are gonna go to the airport on Thursday and pick him up in a limousine!"
S05E14,JERRY,You wanna barrow Golden Boy!
S05E14,ELAINE,"Oh! (pushing Jerry) Do you know what this means, it's like working with Tolstoy!"
S05E14,JERRY,"Hey ya know I read an unbelievable thing about Tolstoy the other day, did you know the original title for ""War and Peace"" was ""War--What Is It Good For?""!"
S05E14,ELAINE,"... (looking at Jerry for a second then, mockingly nods her head back and forth) ....Ha ha ha ha."
S05E14,JERRY,"No, no I'm not kidding Elaine it's true, his mistress didn't like the title and insisted that he change it to ""War and Peace""!"
S05E14,ELAINE,But it's a line from that song!
S05E14,JERRY,That's were they got it from!
S05E14,ELAINE,Really?
S05E14,JERRY,I'm not joking!
S05E14,GEORGE,"You can't handle the truth! (he salutes) (imitating Jack Nicholson [a.k.a. Col. Nathan R. Jessep], from the 1992 movie A Few Good Men)"
S05E14,JERRY,What?
S05E14,GEORGE,"(still in Jacks voice) I'm working on my Jack Nicholson, You can't handle the truth! (he salutes)"
S05E14,ELAINE,What is this your mail? (She takes a magazine and starts flipping through it)
S05E14,GEORGE,"Yeah, I grabbed it on the way out, I don't want my mother reading it."
S05E14,ELAINE,Oh! Your Alumni Magazine.
S05E14,JERRY,Your mother reads your mail?
S05E14,GEORGE,Yeah.
S05E14,JERRY,What do you mean like post-cards an...?
S05E14,GEORGE,"No, anything."
S05E14,JERRY,She doesn't open...?
S05E14,GEORGE,She'll open!
S05E14,JERRY,You've caught your mother opening envelopes!
S05E14,GEORGE,Yes.
S05E14,JERRY,What did she say?
S05E14,GEORGE,I was curious! (imitating his moms voice)
S05E14,JERRY,Isn't that against the law?
S05E14,GEORGE,Maybe I can get her locked up.
S05E14,ELAINE,"(gasp) Hey Jerry, you're in the Alumni magazine! Listen to this Jerry Seinfeld has appeared on ""David Letterman"" and the ""Tonight Show"" and he did a pilot for NBC called ""Jerry"" ...that was not picked up. Georgie, how come theres not anything about you in here?"
S05E14,JERRY,He can't handle the truth!
S05E14,ELAINE,"All right (slaps the magazine down on the counter) this is too much fun, I gotta get back to work. (heads for the door)"
S05E14,KRAMER,"(singing) Johnny Yuma was a rebel, Yeah! ..."
S05E14,KRAMER,Are you all right?
S05E14,ELAINE,Yeah. (startled)
S05E14,KRAMER,Unh.... Sorry.
S05E14,ELAINE,Its OK. (starts walking down the hallway)
S05E14,KRAMER,"Yeah. Oh, here, wait wait (walks a few steps to catch up to her as she stops) Ah, maybe you could ah, use this (he searches through his jacket) Ah, here, it's a electronic organizer..."
S05E14,ELAINE,What?
S05E14,KRAMER,"Ah, Yeah. uh..."
S05E14,ELAINE,Wh..?
S05E14,KRAMER,"Yeah, here it is... yeah."
S05E14,KRAMER,"You know, for phone numbers, addresses, keep appointments, everything."
S05E14,ELAINE,Wow!
S05E14,KRAMER,It's got an alarm that beeps!
S05E14,ELAINE,"Oh! I can't believe this, Kramer!"
S05E14,KRAMER,Yeah.
S05E14,ELAINE,I've been wanting to get one of these things! Are you sure that...
S05E14,ELAINE,...Are you sure you can't use this thing?
S05E14,KRAMER,No no no. I got all my appointments up here. (he points to his head)
S05E14,ELAINE,Where'd you get this?
S05E14,KRAMER,"Well, the bank, I opened up a new account."
S05E14,GEORGE,"Hey, did you see that whale thing on TV last night?"
S05E14,JERRY,No.
S05E14,GEORGE,"I am such a Huge whale fan. These marine biologists were showin' how they communicate with each other with these squeaks and squeals, what a fish!"
S05E14,JERRY,It's a mammal.
S05E14,GEORGE,Whatever. (George looks to the table) Hey new tape recorder?
S05E14,JERRY,"Yeah, got it from the bank."
S05E14,KRAMER,(overly excited) Hey (Claps hands one time)
S05E14,JERRY,Hey.
S05E14,GEORGE,Hey.
S05E14,KRAMER,(still overly excited) Who wants to have some fun!
S05E14,JERRY,I do.
S05E14,GEORGE,I do.
S05E14,KRAMER,"(once again, overly excited) Now are you just sayin' you want to have fun or do you reallllly want to have fun?!"
S05E14,JERRY,I really wanna have fun.
S05E14,GEORGE,I'm just sayin' I wanna have some fun.
S05E14,KRAMER,"Right now there six-hundred Titleists that I got from the driving range in the trunk of my car. Why don't we drive out to Rock-a-Way and hit `em-----------(very over excited) into the ocean! Now picture this.... we find a nice sweet spot between the dunes, we take out our drivers, we tee up and (he makes a golf stroke), that ball goes sailing up into the sky holds there for a moment and then....... ..... gulp!"
S05E14,GEORGE,Come on. Ya wanna go get some lunch?
S05E14,JERRY,"Yeah, let me just stop by the cash machine and I'll meet you over at the coffee shop."
S05E14,GEORGE,"Yeah, I'm gonna get a paper."
S05E14,GEORGE,Keep your head down.
S05E14,KRAMER,Yeah! (Kramer takes a huge imaginary swing)
S05E14,JERRY,"(he hits a few keys and looks over at her) Cash advance... yes (hits a key)  no (he looks over again) balance inquiry... no (he looks again) receipt.... no (he looks again) processing... processing... (He opens the box, pulls out his money and then looks at the woman and says) I won!"
S05E14,DIANE,Jerry?
S05E14,JERRY,Yeah.
S05E14,DIANE,"Its Diane, Diane DeConn, from Queens college."
S05E14,JERRY,Oh Diane.
S05E14,DIANE,(laughing a little) How are you?
S05E14,JERRY,"Good, good."
S05E14,DIANE,(sighs) How long has it been?
S05E14,JERRY,Since college.
S05E14,DIANE,Huh. I've been seeing you on TV you're doin' great.
S05E14,JERRY,Yeah pluggin' along.
S05E14,DIANE,You know I got the Alumni magazine. What ever happened to your friend George? I notice I never see his name in there.
S05E14,JERRY,Well he's kind of modest.
S05E14,DIANE,He was always such a goof-off. I mean did he ever get anywhere?
S05E14,JERRY,Sure.
S05E14,DIANE,Yeah? What field?
S05E14,JERRY,Marine biology.
S05E14,DIANE,George is a marine biologist?!
S05E14,JERRY,"Yeah, pretty damn good one, too!"
S05E14,DIANE,I can't believe it. I-I would never had thought
S05E14,JERRY,"Yeah... hes specializing in whales. He's working on lowering the cholesterol level, in whales all that blubber -- quite unhealthy. You know its the largest mammal on earth but as George says ""they don't have to be."""
S05E14,GEORGE,Diane DeConn? You saw Diane DeConn!
S05E14,JERRY,Something huh?
S05E14,GEORGE,Ahh! How'd she look?
S05E14,JERRY,She looked great.
S05E14,GEORGE,Ahh! (closes his eyes and rolling his head back) Umh!
S05E14,JERRY,She asked about you.
S05E14,GEORGE,She asked about me? What did- What did she say?
S05E14,JERRY,"""How's George?"""
S05E14,GEORGE,"George! She said George? She remembered my name. (loudly -- to a passing waitress and the rest of the restaurant) Diane DeConn remembered my name. She was the ""it"" girl!"
S05E14,JERRY,"Yeah she asked for your number, I think she's gonna get in touch with you."
S05E14,GEORGE,"(pauses for a few seconds) OK, I'm tellin' you right now - if your kiddin' around I'm not gonna be able to be your friend anymore. I'm serious about that. You got that."
S05E14,JERRY,I got no problem with that.
S05E14,GEORGE,"Good. Cause if this is a lie, if this is a joke, if this is your idea of some cute little game we're finished!"
S05E14,JERRY,Expect a call.
S05E14,GEORGE,Oh my god he's not kidding. (exhale gasp)
S05E14,JERRY,"Now, I should tell you that, at this point, she's under the impression that youre - a - ah"
S05E14,GEORGE,A what?
S05E14,JERRY,A marine biologist.
S05E14,GEORGE,(pauses) A marine biologist?
S05E14,JERRY,Yes.
S05E14,GEORGE,Why am I a marine biologist?
S05E14,JERRY,I may have mentioned it.
S05E14,GEORGE,But I'm not a marine biologist!
S05E14,JERRY,Yes I know that.
S05E14,GEORGE,So?
S05E14,JERRY,"Why, you don't think it's a good job?"
S05E14,GEORGE,I didn't even know it was a job.
S05E14,JERRY,Oh it's a fascinating field!
S05E14,GEORGE,Well what if she calls me? What am I supposed to say?! (hand hits the table)
S05E14,GEORGE,"Algae, obviously plankton, hmhm. I don't know what else I could tell ya, ah, Oh I-I just got back from a trip to the Galapagos Islands, I was living with the turtles."
S05E14,[Limo driving on the street -- then inside the limo,"Elaine, Lippman, and Testikov are talkin']"
S05E14,LIPPMAN,"We have got you in a very nice hotel, I-I don't know how you like to work, but ah, I can arrange for an office if you like."
S05E14,TESTIKOV,(Russian accent) I work in hotel.
S05E14,LIPPMAN,Oh.
S05E14,TESTIKOV,is better.
S05E14,TESTIKOV,Away from all your little petty bickerings and interference.
S05E14,LIPPMAN,"You know, Tolstoy use to write in the village square. The faces inspired him."
S05E14,TESTIKOV,(proudly) He did not need inspiration God spoke through his pen. Hu Hu Hu (pounds his fist lightly on his heart)
S05E14,ELAINE,"Ohh, That is so true! (clutches her hands to her chest)"
S05E14,LIPPMAN,Yes.
S05E14,ELAINE,"Although one wonders if ""War and Peace"" would has been as highly acclaimed as it was, had it was published under it's original title ""War---What Is It Good For?"""
S05E14,LIPPMAN,What?
S05E14,ELAINE,Yeah. Mr. Lippman. It was *his mistress* who insisted that he call it
S05E14,LIPPMAN,Elaine
S05E14,[Background cars,Honk Honk]
S05E14,ELAINE,"""War and Peace."""
S05E14,LIPPMAN,Elaine
S05E14,ELAINE,"""War--What Is It Good For."" (sings) Absolutely nothin' HUH! Say it Again! ahehehehe"
S05E14,TESTIKOV,(quietly) Ahhuuh
S05E14,ELAINE,(spoken to Testikov) that's a song
S05E14,LIPPMAN,It (frustrated and trying to keep her from saying more)
S05E14,ELAINE,they-they took it from Tolstoy.
S05E14,LIPPMAN,No. e-Elaine.
S05E14,TESTIKOV,War--What Is It Good For?
S05E14,LIPPMAN,It-no- it's just her sense of humor.
S05E14,ELAINE,No its not. That really is true.
S05E14,TESTIKOV,What is that noise!
S05E14,LIPPMAN,Its Not
S05E14,ELAINE,Yes it is
S05E14,LIPPMAN,No Its Not!!
S05E14,TESTIKOV,That noise!
S05E14,LIPPMAN,it-it-its her purse.
S05E14,TESTIKOV,Where is that noise? Its traveling up my spine! Into my Brain!
S05E14,ELAINE,"Oh, I"
S05E14,LIPPMAN,It's coming from your purse.
S05E14,ELAINE,Oh It must be my new organizer.
S05E14,TESTIKOV,That noise!
S05E14,LIPPMAN,YesTurn it off.
S05E14,ELAINE,"Right, I think its this"
S05E14,LIPPMAN,No its the Button. Elaine
S05E14,TESTIKOV,I can not stand it!
S05E14,LIPPMAN,"It's the button at the top, the top."
S05E14,ELAINE,OK. I dont quite know
S05E14,TESTIKOV,Will you Turn it off!
S05E14,LIPPMAN,The one at the top.
S05E14,ELAINE,"Yeah, Im gonna work on that"
S05E14,TESTIKOV,Aaach!
S05E14,LIPPMAN,Yeah Ohoo.
S05E14,JERRY,I did it for you.
S05E14,GEORGE,"I dont know whatcha had to tell her that for. You put me in a very difficult position, Marine Biologist! I'm very uncomfortable with this whole thing."
S05E14,JERRY,You know with all do respect I would think it's right up your alley.
S05E14,GEORGE,"Well it's not up my alley! It's one thing if I make it up. I know what I'm doin, I know my alleys! You got me in the Galapagos Islands livin' with the turtles, I don't know where the hell I am."
S05E14,JERRY,"Well you came in the other day with all that whale stuff, the squeaking and the squealing and"
S05E14,GEORGE,"Look, why couldn't you make me an architect? You know I always wanted to pretend that I was an architect. Well I-I'm supposed to see her tomorrow, I-I-I'm gonna tell her what's goin on. I mean maybe she just likes me for me."
S05E14,KRAMER,Hey.
S05E14,JERRY,Hey.
S05E14,KRAMER,Hey ya want these (He throws down the golf clubs -- kicks the bag hard) I don't want em!
S05E14,JERRY,What?
S05E14,KRAMER,"I stink! I can't play! The ball is just sitting there, Jerry, and I can't hit it! I only hit one really good ball that went way out there!"
S05E14,JERRY,Well what happened?
S05E14,KRAMER,I have no concentration!
S05E14,JERRY,"What, what, what's wrong with you?"
S05E14,KRAMER,"Sand, I can get rid of the sand. (he sits at the table, looking down his shirt) Look theres still some in here, it won't go away! Look I even got sand in the pockets!"
S05E14,JERRY,"Hey come on, you're getting it all over the floor!"
S05E14,JERRY,"(to the phone) Hello yeah yes it is really ah, ah Could you hold on a second? (to George and Kramer) Hey listen to this, some woman found an electronic organizer, my name was in it, she wants me to help her track down the owner."
S05E14,GEORGE,How'd she find it?
S05E14,JERRY,Shes waking down the street and it hit her in the head!
S05E14,CORINNE,"So I am walkin' along, minding my own business when all off the sudden this thing comes flying out of nowhere and clonks me right on the head."
S05E14,JERRY,Wow.
S05E14,CORINNE,"Yeah, So they took me to the hospital"
S05E14,JERRY,Yeah
S05E14,CORINNE,"and they put me in this thing, that feels like a coffin, for forty-five minutes. Have you ever been in one of those things? You could go berserk in there!"
S05E14,JERRY,Well you have insurance...
S05E14,CORINNE,I wish!
S05E14,JERRY,Unbelievable!
S05E14,CORINNE,Yeah.
S05E14,JERRY,What is with this thing.
S05E14,CORINNE,"(hits the organizer) I don't know, it never shuts up. So anyway, you could see why I would be interested in finding this person."
S05E14,JERRY,Absolutely. You should not have to pay for that.
S05E14,CORINNE,"(hits the organizer, picks it up and hits it on to the table -- shouting) Stop it! Stop it!"
S05E14,JERRY,Let me have a look at this thing.
S05E14,CORINNE,Ya know it was somebody told me they thought they saw that thing come out of a limousine.
S05E14,JERRY,"Typical rich people, using the world for their personal garbage can."
S05E14,CORINNE,Boy am I lucky your name came up. I just pushed a button.
S05E14,JERRY,I would like to know what my names doin in this creep's organizer to begin with.
S05E14,CORINNE,Yeah.
S05E14,JERRY,Who do I know who would have even been in a limousine yesterday anyway. Uhh-O h-owow!
S05E14,KRAMER,"Wha-- Oh, hey."
S05E14,ELAINE,"Hey, ""great"" organizer you gave me."
S05E14,KRAMER,"Oh, you liked it huh."
S05E14,ELAINE,"It wouldn't stop beeping, in the car so Testikov, through it out the window."
S05E14,KRAMER,Oh. (continuing to itch and scratch from the sand)
S05E14,ELAINE,"I transferred everything in there. I threw out my old book. I'm lost now, Kramer."
S05E14,ELAINE,"What, what is it?"
S05E14,KRAMER,"The sand, it's everywhere! (blows on his arm)"
S05E14,ELAINE,OK I'll see you later.
S05E14,KRAMER,Yei-
S05E14,JERRY,"Oh, there you are!"
S05E14,ELAINE,There you are!
S05E14,JERRY,So?
S05E14,ELAINE,So?
S05E14,JERRY,So what do you have to say for yourself?
S05E14,ELAINE,So what do you have to say for yourself?
S05E14,JERRY,Why should I have anything for say for myself?
S05E14,ELAINE,"""War-- What is it good for?""!"
S05E14,JERRY,A-Ahahahahah. Who told you?
S05E14,ELAINE,"A-hu hu hu hu. Yuri Testikov, the Russian writer! Hellooo!"
S05E14,JERRY,"You told Testikov, (Elaine nods) that Tolstoy wanted to name his book ""War-- What Is IT Good For?""?"
S05E14,ELAINE,Uh-hu. And do you know what happened?
S05E14,JERRY,Can I take a guess?
S05E14,ELAINE,"Oh, Please."
S05E14,JERRY,"Oh I don't know, he threw your organizer out the window?"
S05E14,ELAINE,"What, how did you know that?"
S05E14,JERRY,Because I know who has it.
S05E14,ELAINE,(gasps) How did you find it?
S05E14,JERRY,"Because the woman who got hit in the head with it found my name, called me up, and we met!"
S05E14,ELAINE,"(gasps) Where is it, give it to me!"
S05E14,JERRY,I don't have it!
S05E14,ELAINE,Why not.
S05E14,JERRY,Because she's not returning it until she gets the money back for the hospital bill.
S05E14,ELAINE,"But I didn't do it. Testikov did it, he should pay for it!"
S05E14,JERRY,How much is Testikov getting from Pendant for this book?
S05E14,ELAINE,One million.
S05E14,JERRY,Well that's a start.
S05E14,GEORGE,"Then of course with evolution, the octopus lost the nostrils and took on the more familiar look that we know today."
S05E14,DIANE,Uh-Really?
S05E14,GEORGE,"Yeah, but if you still look closely you can see ah, a little bump where the nose use to be. huhuhuhu."
S05E14,DIANE,Wow.
S05E14,GEORGE,"But enough about fish, huhuhu. I can discuss other things you know, ah architecture. Huhu. (makes a wide gesture with his arms)"
S05E14,JERRY,You know what room Testikov's in?
S05E14,ELAINE,"Yeah, 308. Oh, I'm crazy for doing this!"
S05E14,JERRY,"Well, you want your organizer back don't you?"
S05E14,ELAINE,Why are you so interested -- you want to take her out?
S05E14,JERRY,Hey you know when Superman saves someone no one asks if he's trying to hit on her!
S05E14,ELAINE,"Well, you're not Superman."
S05E14,JERRY,Well you're not Lois Lane.
S05E14,ELAINE,"Oh. Listen, you got the tape-recorder."
S05E14,JERRY,Yeah I got it. You sure you want to do this? (hands Elaine the tape recorder.)
S05E14,ELAINE,"Yeah I gotta get Testikov on tape. If this woman ends up in the ""New England Journal Of Medicine"" I'm not gonna pay for it."
S05E14,JERRY,"Oh, here she comes."
S05E14,JERRY,Hi.
S05E14,CORINNE,Hi.
S05E14,JERRY,"Elaine, this is Corinne."
S05E14,CORINNE,Hello.
S05E14,ELAINE,"Hi, (sighs) you got the organizer?"
S05E14,JERRY,"All right lets go. We'll meet you back down here in ten minutes, hopefully with the money."
S05E14,DIANE,"Your parents must be so proud of you, George."
S05E14,GEORGE,"Oh, they're busting!"
S05E14,DIANE,Hmhm.
S05E14,DIANE,What are those people doing over there?
S05E14,TESTIKOV,"(In a loud and cranky voice) What, Come in - come in - Come in Miss Benes! That is if you can spare a minute from your busy schedule! And you bring guest for my entertainment?"
S05E14,ELAINE,"Um, yes this is my friend Jerry. Um, he accompanied me, ya know (clears throat), single women in a big city can be dangerous, so"
S05E14,JERRY,"Yeah. Th-That's why I where these sneakers, in case of any trouble -- Zip, I'm gone. (makes a running motion with both arms and his right foot)"
S05E14,TESTIKOV,"Yeah, Yeah. The sneakers. All the Americans with the sneakers. Always running from something. Ya ya, well Sit, stop running, Ehh. two minutes, I give you latest manuscript!"
S05E14,JERRY,Oh! Rimsky -- great great book if I may say so sir. I almost read the whole thing.
S05E14,ELAINE,Hmm. (she nods in agreement)
S05E14,CORINNE,What!
S05E14,HOTEL CLERK,"If you can't thing off, I'll have to ask you to leave."
S05E14,CORINNE,I'm waitin for two people! (takes a drag on the cigarette)
S05E14,HOTEL CLERK,Well you can wait for them outside.
S05E14,CORINNE,"Yeah, (she blows smoke out as she speaks -- it rises as in front of her) I guess I'd better. I wouldn't want to take any attention away from the hookers!"
S05E14,HOTEL CLERK,"All right, All right. Out, Out."
S05E14,CORINNE,"Whatever you say, Cro..w-well!"
S05E14,DIANE,What's going on over here?
S05E14,WOMAN AT BEACH,"There is a beached whale, she's dying."
S05E14,VOICE,Is anyone here a marine biologist?
S05E14,TESTIKOV,"Here is latest draft. I see you next week. Same time, same day. (smacks the manuscript into Elaines hand) On time please."
S05E14,ELAINE,(quietly) OK.
S05E14,JERRY,It was nice meeting you
S05E14,TESTIKOV,Aah.
S05E14,JERRY,youre a real pleasure. (Jerry is being sarcastic)
S05E14,TESTIKOV,Ya ya. (wipes his nose with a handkerchief)
S05E14,ELAINE,"Uh-Oh-ah, by the way Mr. Testikov um, do you remember the other day when we were in the limo and ah, my organizer started making noise and you threw it out the window?"
S05E14,TESTIKOV,(quietly) yes. How could I forget? heehe.
S05E14,ELAINE,"( laughs) Well um, would you believe that it actually, hit somebody in the head."
S05E14,JERRY,Right in the head! (leans in and points at Testikov)
S05E14,ELAINE,Boing! Hehe hehe. (makes a hand gesture to her forehead and away)
S05E14,TESTIKOV,(Shouting) What is that noise!
S05E14,ELAINE,Oh thats nothing. Um and anyway um
S05E14,TESTIKOV,Whats going on Huh! (he grabs Elaines purse) That Noise!
S05E14,ELAINE,"No, No that's my purse!"
S05E14,TESTIKOV,That Noise!
S05E14,ELAINE,"No, get-get off my purse!"
S05E14,TESTIKOV,"Agh, its recorder!"
S05E14,ELAINE,No that's Radio!
S05E14,TESTIKOV,Ha! (he clicks the player off) You are spying on me!
S05E14,CROWD,Come on! Save the whale! You gotta do it!
S05E14,DIANE,Save the whale George... for me.
S05E14,GEORGE,"So I started to walk into the water. I won't lie to you boys, I was terrified! But I pressed on -- and as I made my way passed the breakers a strange calm came over me. I-I don't know if it was divine intervention or the kinship of all living things but I tell you Jerry at that moment  I was a Marine Biologist!"
S05E14,ELAINE,"George Ive just reading this thing in the paper, it's unbelievable!"
S05E14,GEORGE,I know I was just telling them the story.
S05E14,KRAMER,"Well come on George, finish the story."
S05E14,GEORGE,The sea was angry that day my friends like an old man trying to send back soup in a deli!
S05E14,GEORGE,"I got about fifty-feet out and suddenly, the great beast appeared before me. I tell ya he was ten stories high if he was a foot. As if sensing my presence he let out a great bellow. I said, ""Easy big fella!"" And then, as I watched him struggling I realized, that something was obstructing its breathing. From where I was standing I could see directly into the eye of the great fish!"
S05E14,JERRY,Mammal.
S05E14,GEORGE,Whatever.
S05E14,KRAMER,"Well then, what did you do next?"
S05E14,GEORGE,"Well then, from out of nowhere, a huge tidal wave lifted me, tossed like a cork and I found myself right on top of him, (ELAINE gasps quietly Ahhhh) face to face with the blow-hole. I-I, I could barely see from the waves crashing down upon me but, I knew something was there so I reached my hand in, felt around and pulled out the obstruction!"
S05E14,KRAMER,What is that a Titleist?
S05E14,GEORGE,(Silently squinches his mouth and nods at Kramer)
S05E14,KRAMER,A hole in one eh.
S05E14,JERRY,Well the-the crowd must have gone wild!
S05E14,GEORGE,"Ohh yes, yes. Yes Jerry they were all over me. It was like Rocky 1, Hm. Diane came up to me, threw her arms around me"
S05E14,KRAMER,(quietly) Um-hm.
S05E14,GEORGE,"kissed me. We both had tears streaming down our faces. I never saw anyone so beautiful. It was at that moment that I decided to tell her that, I was not a marine biologist."
S05E14,JERRY,Wow! What'd she say?
S05E14,GEORGE,"Told me to ""Go to hell!"" and I took the bus home."
S05E14,JERRY,All right lets go.
S05E14,ELAINE,"What, are you in a bad mood?"
S05E14,JERRY,Ahhh got my laundry back.
S05E14,ELAINE,Ohhh! Golden Boy?
S05E14,JERRY,He didn't make it.
S05E14,ELAINE,I'm sorry. (pats him on the arm)
S05E14,JERRY,Yea. (pulls at the t-shirt) This is Golden Boy's son Baby Blue.
S05E14,KRAMER,(to George) What's with you?
S05E14,GEORGE,Sand. It's everywhere
S05E14,KRAMER,Yep.
S05E15,JERRY,"Aren't mannequins an insult to your imagination? You couldn't possibly visualize a sweater so we'll show you on this life size snotty puppet. I guess when they finish with them they become crash test dummies. That's the end of the line for a mannequin. ""What ever happened to Bob?"" ""Have you seen that new Volvo commercial? He's got a bulls eye right in his face."" Mannequins are only used for car accidents and fashion, I guess these are the two situations that it's impossible for us to imagine ourselves. Well dressed or getting killed. I'm sure there is some pro-mannequin organization that doesn't even like you to use the term mannequin. ""Hey they're not mannequins, they're the life deprived."""
S05E15,AUDREY,Hum! That was really good!
S05E15,JERRY,Yeah. are you full?
S05E15,AUDREY,"Oh no, I've had just enough."
S05E15,JERRY,"Ah, here we go... apple pie! Best apple pie in the city. (Jerry starts eating) Mmm, delicious. I'm not waiting for you. Take some."
S05E15,AUDREY,No thanks.
S05E15,JERRY,You're not gonna have any?
S05E15,AUDREY,No (with a disgusted face)
S05E15,JERRY,Do you not like apple pie?
S05E15,AUDREY,"No, it's not that."
S05E15,JERRY,"Well, at least taste it."
S05E15,AUDREY,"No (a resolute ""no"")"
S05E15,JERRY,You won't even taste it?
S05E15,AUDREY,No.
S05E15,JERRY,"Come on, try it! (Audrey shakes her head doing ""no"") A little taste! (still shaking) Come on. (still shaking)"
S05E15,JERRY,She wouldn't so much as taste it.
S05E15,GEORGE,Did she say why?
S05E15,JERRY,No. She wouldn't say anything. She just kept shaking her head like this (Imitating Audrey)
S05E15,GEORGE,Maybe she's diabetic.
S05E15,JERRY,No. She carries Entemanns doughnuts in her purse.
S05E15,GEORGE,Maybe you said something that offended her.
S05E15,JERRY,The only thing I can think of is I told her we should have those moving walkways all over the city.
S05E15,GEORGE,Like at the airport? (getting excited)
S05E15,JERRY,Yeah.
S05E15,GEORGE,That's a great idea!!!
S05E15,JERRY,Tell me about it!
S05E15,GEORGE,We could be zipping all over the place.
S05E15,JERRY,They could at least try it.
S05E15,GEORGE,They never try anything.
S05E15,JERRY,What's the harm?
S05E15,GEORGE,No harm!
S05E15,JERRY,(still talking to George) I'm sorry. There's no reason for her not to taste that pie.
S05E15,ELAINE,Who wouldn't taste a pie?
S05E15,JERRY,Audrey.
S05E15,ELAINE,Dump her.
S05E15,JERRY,"Boy, I never broke up with anyone for not tasting pie???"
S05E15,ELAINE,(piffling) I once broke up with someone for not offering me pie.
S05E15,JERRY,You did?
S05E15,ELAINE,"He could be eating a gyro, he wouldn't offer me anything. It's a sickness."
S05E15,GEORGE,"Well, I can't walk anywhere now. I'm just gonna be wishing there were walkways. (seeing Elaine removing her shoe) What are you doing?"
S05E15,ELAINE,I got a pebble.
S05E15,JERRY,"Boy, I never heard of that happening to a woman?"
S05E15,ELAINE,What the hell does that mean?
S05E15,KRAMER,Hey! Elaine. Go Like this. (imitating a mannequin posture)
S05E15,ELAINE,What? Why?
S05E15,KRAMER,Do it. Do it. This.
S05E15,ELAINE,Like... (doing it) Like this?
S05E15,KRAMER,Oh yeah! It's you!
S05E15,ELAINE,What's me?
S05E15,KRAMER,(to the gang) There's a clothing store downtown. They got a mannequin in there that looks exactly like Elaine.
S05E15,ELAINE,Get out!
S05E15,KRAMER,"It's uncanny! It's like they chopped off your arms and legs, dipped you in plastic, and screwed you back all together again, and stuck you on a pedestal. It's really quite exquisite."
S05E15,GEORGE,"Kramer, what's the name of the store with the mannequin?"
S05E15,KRAMER,Rinitze. (he takes Jerry's spatula and starts rubbing his back with it) Oh yeah...
S05E15,JERRY,(to Kramer) Uh... may I help you? (wondering what the hell's Kramer doing)
S05E15,KRAMER,"It's this itch. I was watching TV without my shirt on, and one my couch cushions didn't have any fabric on it."
S05E15,GEORGE,"Wait a minute, Rinitze? Don't they have somme really cool suits in there?"
S05E15,KRAMER,Real Boss!
S05E15,ELAINE,I'm going down there.
S05E15,GEORGE,"I'm gonna go with you. I gotta get a new suit. I got a second interview with MacKenzie, and I think I'm really close. They're all taking me out to lunch on Friday."
S05E15,ELAINE,"(grabbing George by the arm, hurried to leave) Let's go."
S05E15,GEORGE,All right. All right. (They both leave)
S05E15,KRAMER,"(leaving too, with the spatula) Are you gonna need this?"
S05E15,JERRY,Keep it. (implied please)
S05E15,ELAINE,It looks exactly like me.
S05E15,GEORGE,It's like some pod landed from another planet and took your body. Don't fall asleep Elaine.
S05E15,ELAINE,What's going on here? How do you think this happened?
S05E15,GEORGE,"Whoa, look at this. This is a beautiful suit. Huh?"
S05E15,ELAINE,You think that could be a coincidence George? Is that possible?
S05E15,SALESWOMAN,(european accent) You are perfect for that suit.
S05E15,GEORGE,You think so?
S05E15,ELAINE,(to the saleswoman) Excuse me. Where did this come from?
S05E15,SALESWOMAN,I don't know.
S05E15,GEORGE,You really think this looks O.K. on me?
S05E15,SALESWOMAN,Fabulous. Perfect fit. And it's the last one we have.
S05E15,ELAINE,I'm sorry. You can't tell me where the mannequin came from?
S05E15,SALESWOMAN,"I told you, I don't know."
S05E15,ELAINE,"(irritated, but still polite) Well, is there somebody around here I could talk to who would know?"
S05E15,SALESWOMAN,Why?
S05E15,ELAINE,Isn't it obvious? This mannequin looks exactly like me.
S05E15,ELAINE,"(upset) Did you just roll your eyes at him? Because let me tell you something, if anobody should be rolling their eyes, it is me at him about you."
S05E15,SALESWOMAN,I think maybe you're flattering yourself. That mannquein is wearing a twelve hundred dollar Gaultier dress.
S05E15,ELAINE,"What are you saying, that I'm not good enough for this hideous dress? (looking at her name tag) Listen Natasha... I wouldn't be caught dead wearing your crummy little euro-trash rags. (to George) I'll meet you outside."
S05E15,SALESWOMAN,What is her problem?
S05E15,GEORGE,"Ah, Pfft! What can you do? (looking at a tag on the suit) Is this the price tag?"
S05E15,SALESWOMAN,Yes.
S05E15,GEORGE,"Yes, hello. Party's over. (taking off the suit)"
S05E15,SALESWOMAN,"I'll tell you a little secret. We're having an unadvertised sale starting Friday, that suit will be half-price."
S05E15,GEORGE,So you think you can put the suit aside and hold it for me?
S05E15,SALESWOMAN,"Oh, I'm afraid I could't do that. It wouldn't be fair to the other customers."
S05E15,GEORGE,"Oh yes, of course, and we have to be fair. (placing the suit further away in the rack)"
S05E15,ELAINE,"So, I found out who supplies the mannequins and I called 'em up."
S05E15,KRAMER,"Well, how did they get your face?"
S05E15,ELAINE,"I don't know. They wouldn't tell me. (Jerry is not listening, he's looking at two women sitting in the other booth) Jerry? Je... Hello?"
S05E15,JERRY,(Jerry gets up and walk to these persons) Uh... Excuse me. I couldn't help but notice you offered her a piece of your pie.
S05E15,WOMAN 1,That's right.
S05E15,JERRY,And you waved it away.
S05E15,WOMAN 2,Right.
S05E15,JERRY,Did you give her a reason?
S05E15,WOMAN 2,"Yes, I was full."
S05E15,JERRY,You were full. So you gave a reason. You didn't just shake your head.
S05E15,WOMAN 2,"No, I'm not a psycho."
S05E15,JERRY,"Exactly. You're not a psycho. You've been very helpful. Thank you very much. Allow me to leave the tip. (sits back with Elaine and Kramer) Well, I think we proven who the psycho is."
S05E15,ELAINE,We certainly have.
S05E15,KRAMER,"Hey, Elaine scratch my back."
S05E15,ELAINE,No way!
S05E15,KRAMER,"Come on, one lap around."
S05E15,ELAINE,No.
S05E15,KRAMER,It will be a funky adventure.
S05E15,ELAINE,"Kramer, forget it."
S05E15,KRAMER,"Jerry, how about you?"
S05E15,JERRY,I think you know my policy.
S05E15,KRAMER,I'm going home to spatula. (picks up the check and walks to the cashier)
S05E15,ELAINE,I thought George was meeting us here?
S05E15,JERRY,No he's going downtown to guard the suit.
S05E15,ELAINE,He's guarding a suit?
S05E15,OLIVE,(the cashier; to Kramer) Do you need some help with that itch?
S05E15,KRAMER,"Madam, I pray you're not toying with me. (Olive shows her long finger nails) Whoa."
S05E15,OLIVE,Turn around.
S05E15,KRAMER,"Oh, all right. (Olive scratches, Kramer enjoys, Elaine and Jerry watch.)"
S05E15,SALESWOMAN,(makes a guy trying the suit) It fits you perfectly.
S05E15,BOB,You think so? (she nods and walks away)
S05E15,GEORGE,"(outside, looking the guy trying the suit through the window, and thinking out loud) What's this? Can't I leave this place for a second? (goes in, take off his jacket, walks to the guy and talks to him with an european accent) Can I help you?"
S05E15,BOB,I'm buying the suit.
S05E15,GEORGE,"No, no, no, this suit is not for sale. (tries to take off the suit from the guy)"
S05E15,BOB,"Excuse me, do you work here?"
S05E15,GEORGE,(leaving the european accent) No. (laughs)
S05E15,BOB,Then what the hell business is it of yours?
S05E15,GEORGE,"Look, I'm doing you a favor. They're having an unadvertised sale. This suit is gonna be half-priced starting ... Monday."
S05E15,BOB,Really?
S05E15,GEORGE,Yea Yea Yea
S05E15,BOB,This Monday?
S05E15,GEORGE,Yes. Now take off those pants.
S05E15,SALESWOMAN,"Actually, the unadvertised sale starts on Friday."
S05E15,BOB,Friday? Thanks. (Gives a dirty look at George and leaves)
S05E15,GEORGE,"(to the saleswoman) You know honey for an unadvertised sale, you're doing a lot of yapping about it."
S05E15,JERRY,I can't beleive your father owns this place. So how are the desserts here?
S05E15,AUDREY,Everything is delicious.
S05E15,JERRY,You've tasted them?
S05E15,AUDREY,"Um-hmm, I think almost all of them."
S05E15,JERRY,Oh I see they have apple pie.
S05E15,AUDREY,Mmm-hmm.
S05E15,JERRY,You've had the apple pie?
S05E15,AUDREY,Many times.
S05E15,JERRY,"Audrey, I got to be honest with you. I'm a very curious guy. It's my nature. I need to know things. Not tasting the apple pie the other day, I can't get past it. You obviously like pies. You carry doughnuts in your bag, you're not averse to pastry. Surely you could see how such a thing would prey on my mind."
S05E15,AUDREY,Can we drop this?
S05E15,JERRY,(like a frustrated child) Why can't I know?
S05E15,AUDREY,Ah! Poppie.
S05E15,POPPIE,"Sweetheart, hello."
S05E15,AUDREY,"Poppie, this is Jerry."
S05E15,POPPIE,Welcome (shakes Jerry's hand)
S05E15,JERRY,Hello Poppie.
S05E15,POPPIE,Don't fill up on the bread. I'm making you a very special dinner. Very special. (he leaves)
S05E15,JERRY,The pies. I'm going to the bathroom. You know. (he leaves)
S05E15,[Poppie's Restaurant,Bathroom]
S05E15,POPPIE,"Ah, Jerry! Tonight you in for a real treat. I'm personnaly going to prepare the dinner for you and my Audrey."
S05E15,AUDREY,Jerry are you OK?
S05E15,JERRY,Huh?
S05E15,AUDREY,Is anything wrong?
S05E15,JERRY,"No, Nothing."
S05E15,AUDREY,You look like you've seen a ghost.
S05E15,OLIVE,(to another cashier) I'll see you tomorrow.
S05E15,KRAMER,Hey. These are for you Olive.
S05E15,OLIVE,Thank you.
S05E15,KRAMER,Ohh!
S05E15,POPPIE,Here it is.
S05E15,AUDREY,"Wait till you taste this. (she eats) Poppie, this is perfect."
S05E15,POPPIE,(to Jerry) Well?
S05E15,AUDREY,"Jerry have some. (Jerry shakes his head doing ""no"") You're not gonna taste it? (still shaking) Jerry. (still shaking)"
S05E15,JERRY,So she tought I did it to get back at her
S05E15,GEORGE,Why didn't you just tell her?
S05E15,JERRY,"I don't think that's the kind of thing you wanna hear about your father. But I'll tell you when he came out of that bathroom and he was kneading that dough, it was a wild scene."
S05E15,GEORGE,How could he not have washed?
S05E15,JERRY,"Even if you're not gonna soap up, at least pretend for my benefit. Turn the water on, do something."
S05E15,GEORGE,"Yeah, just like I do."
S05E15,JERRY,"You know a chef who doesn't wash is like a cop who steals. It's a cry for help, he wants to get caught."
S05E15,GEORGE,"Well, I think Poppie's got some problems. There's a whole other thing going on with Poppie. So how did you leave it?"
S05E15,JERRY,We haven't spoken.
S05E15,KRAMER,"Well, I'm not gonna need this anymore. I got Olive. (Jerry throws out the spatula)"
S05E15,GEORGE,Olive?
S05E15,KRAMER,Yeah. My lady friend down at Monks.
S05E15,GEORGE,Oh.
S05E15,KRAMER,"You guys ought to see the way she works her nails across my back. Ohh! She's a maestro. The crisscross. The figure eight, strummin' the ol' banjo, and this wild, savage free-for-all where anything can happen."
S05E15,GEORGE,I got to get downtown and buy that suit. The store opens in twenty minutes.
S05E15,KRAMER,Is that Elaine mannequin still there?
S05E15,GEORGE,Yeah.
S05E15,KRAMER,Yeah.
S05E15,GEORGE,"The last time I saw her, she was naked."
S05E15,JERRY,"Yeah, and Poppie's got problems..."
S05E15,BOB,Where is it? Where is it?
S05E15,GEORGE,"(George takes out the suit from the other rack) Well, look at this. (innocently) This doesn't belong here! Someone has made a terrible mistake."
S05E15,BOB,You bastard! You hid the suit.
S05E15,GEORGE,"Hid? I have no idea how this suit got misplaced. Nevertheless, I do believe I shall purchase it."
S05E15,BOB,"I hope you rot in that suit. Look I'm gonna get you for this. I don't know how, but I'm gonna get you. You are going to pay!"
S05E15,GEORGE,"Oh, I'll pay. Half-price. Arrivederci my fellow 40-short."
S05E15,ELAINE,"So I made a little list of people who might've made the mannequin. You know, possible suspects."
S05E15,JERRY,"Yeah, all right. Go ahead. (not very interested)"
S05E15,ELAINE,"There's this blind guy at a party I was at, and he felt my face for a really long time. You know, to see what I looked like. He almost put his finger up my nose."
S05E15,JERRY,"(very disinterested) Hum... ok, what else you got?"
S05E15,ELAINE,"OK, I'm not gonna tell you the rest of the list."
S05E15,JERRY,"Oh, because I didn't think the blind guy did it?"
S05E15,ELAINE,Because you have an attitude.
S05E15,JERRY and ELAINE,Oh!
S05E15,JERRY,Georgio! Nice duds!
S05E15,GEORGE,"You're telling me. (he walks around and the suit makes a swooshing sound) So, what do you think?"
S05E15,JERRY,Did you hear something?
S05E15,ELAINE,"Yeah, like a swoosh."
S05E15,JERRY,Yeah.
S05E15,ELAINE,(feels the fabric) It must be the fabric. It's rubbing between you thighs when you walk. That's what's making that swooshy sound.
S05E15,GEORGE,I probably didn't hear it on the way over because of the street noise. (he panics) This is no good! I got to meet these guys from MacKenzie for lunch in half an hour!
S05E15,JERRY,So what? What would they care?
S05E15,GEORGE,"This MacKenzie, he's a bit of a nut. Someone told me he fired the last guy because his nose whistled when he breathed."
S05E15,JERRY,So you think you're not gonna get the job because your pants make a noise?
S05E15,GEORGE,"Let's say it comes down to me and one other guy. He's got a nice quiet suit, and I'm whooshing all over the place! Who do you think he's gonna hire?"
S05E15,JERRY,"You know, I think all these interviews are making you nuts."
S05E15,KRAMER,"Hey Jerry, I saw your girlfriend was in here before."
S05E15,JERRY,Audrey?
S05E15,KRAMER,"Yep. Sat down, had herself a piece of pie."
S05E15,JERRY,Was it apple?
S05E15,KRAMER,What else?
S05E15,JERRY,This woman is bending my mind into a pretzel!
S05E15,STRANGER,Do I know you?
S05E15,ELAINE,Hmm... No you don't.
S05E15,STRANGER,Yeah! You were wearing a G-string and one of those bras with points.
S05E15,ELAINE,The mannequin!
S05E15,JERRY,"Oh, I got to see this thing."
S05E15,JERRY,"Boy, the resemblance is uncanny."
S05E15,ELAINE,You think you can pose me however you want? That's my ass in your window!
S05E15,SALESWOMAN,"It's our store and our mannequin, we can do whatever we want with it."
S05E15,ELAINE,"No! You take that mannequin down right now, or I'm pressing charges. (Jerry goes along) Yes, this is my attorney."
S05E15,SALESWOMAN,(to Jerry) Yeah? What law am I breaking?
S05E15,JERRY,"Well, I believe there's some legal precedent - Winchell vs. Mahoney,"
S05E15,ELAINE,Uh-huh
S05E15,JERRY,The Charlie Macarthy hearings.
S05E15,ELAINE,Uh-huh. Are you taking this down?
S05E15,SALESWOMAN,I'm getting the manager. (she leaves)
S05E15,ELAINE,Jerry get the car. (she's getting the mannequin)
S05E15,JERRY,What are you doing?
S05E15,ELAINE,Just get the car!
S05E15,JERRY,"Elaine, as your legal counsel I must advise against this."
S05E15,JERRY,"I don't know about you, but I'm getting a hankering for some doublemint gum. Alright, I'm dropping you off at work, right?"
S05E15,ELAINE,Where are you going?
S05E15,JERRY,Poppie's
S05E15,MACKENZIE,"Thanks for meeting me down here George. My office is out of control, (George's pants are making noise) phones ringing, people running in and out. (MacKenzie stops talking and walking, George too) Did you hear something?"
S05E15,GEORGE,"No, I didn't hear anything."
S05E15,MACKENZIE,"Huh, that's strange. (they start walking again) It's quieter here. We can concentrate without people wooshing around... (he stops again, George too) That sound again. Sure you didn't hear anything?"
S05E15,GEORGE,"No, can't say as I did."
S05E15,MACKENZIE,Kind of like a... rustling.
S05E15,GEORGE,Could be the leaves...
S05E15,AUDREY,That's right. Poppie's on 77th. Ok we'll see you at 800. Bye-bye.
S05E15,JERRY,Hello.
S05E15,AUDREY,What are you doing here?
S05E15,JERRY,So how was the pie?
S05E15,AUDREY,What pie?
S05E15,JERRY,The apple pie you had today at Monks
S05E15,AUDREY,I'm very busy here.
S05E15,JERRY,"Pretty good, wasn'it? I told you you should've tasted it."
S05E15,AUDREY,You better not let Poppie see you here.
S05E15,HEALTH INSPECTOR,"All right, I'm looking for someone named Poppie."
S05E15,AUDREY,"Uh, who are you?"
S05E15,HEALTH INSPECTOR,"Board of health, we've had several complaints."
S05E15,JERRY,"Oh, about the... uh (Jerry pretend to wash his hands)"
S05E15,HEALTH INSPECTOR,Are you Poppie?
S05E15,POPPIE,I'm Poppie.
S05E15,HEALTH INSPECTOR,I think you'd better come with me.
S05E15,POPPIE,What's the problem?
S05E15,AUDREY,What do they want from Poppie?
S05E15,JERRY,"Well, Poppie's a little sloppy."
S05E15,MACKENZIE,You taught I'd care about your pants wooshing?
S05E15,GEORGE,I heard the last guy got fired because his nose whislted.
S05E15,MACKENZIE,"No, no, no. He got fired because he wasn't a team player. That's something we don't joke about at MacKenzie. You'll find we're team here George. We don't tolerate dissent. If you want to go your own way, you're in the wrong place."
S05E15,GEORGE,No problem there. Conformity is an obsession with me.
S05E15,WAITER,Chocolate cream pie. Compliments of the house.
S05E15,MACKENZIE,Oh! Hope you saved room for dessert.
S05E15,WAITER,(to George) The chef said that he made it special for you.
S05E15,GEORGE,Oh... (George looks around and sees the chef hiding behind a plant it's Bob!)
S05E15,MACKENZIE,"Mmm.. Best pie I've ever tasted. Take a bite George. (George shakes his head doing ""no"") Well, take a bite. It's delicious. (still shaking) I insist. (still shaking)"
S05E15,BUSINESSMAN,"If you're one of us, you'll take a bite."
S05E15,JERRY,So you didn't get the job.
S05E15,GEORGE,No. But I was the only one at the table that didn't get violently ill.
S05E15,JERRY,"Kramer, you can't keep avoiding her like this, you're gonna have to say something."
S05E15,KRAMER,What am I supposed to say?
S05E15,JERRY,Tell her you lost your itch.
S05E15,GEORGE,What happened to your itch?
S05E15,KRAMER,I lost it two days ago. I've been faking it so I wouldn't hurt her feelings.
S05E15,JERRY,Well you should tell her.
S05E15,KRAMER,"I'll let her down easy. All right. (he gets up and walks to Olive) Well, hi Olive. (she reaches for Kramer's back) No, no. No more of that. There's something I have to tell you."
S05E15,OLIVE,What?
S05E15,KRAMER,"Uh, well, there's someone else."
S05E15,OLIVE,Someone else?
S05E15,KRAMER,"Yeah, yeah, yeah..."
S05E15,OLIVE,Who is she?
S05E15,KRAMER,Her. (he points to the Elaine mannequin in Jerry's car)
S05E15,OLIVE,her?
S05E15,KRAMER,"Yeah, there she is. That's my gal."
S05E15,OLIVE,You're a liar. I've seen her in here before. She's not your girlfriend.
S05E15,KRAMER,"Now Olive, look, I'm sorry."
S05E15,OLIVE,Why is she wearing her underwear?
S05E15,KRAMER,"Well, it's the style. (turns back to Jerry) Jerry give me the keys. (Jerry throws his keys to Kramer) Well, I guess we're gonna go for a drive now. She really loves that."
S05E15,GEORGE,Did you ever solve the riddle of the pie?
S05E15,JERRY,No. That's one for the ages. But I think they're gonna put Poppie away for a long long time.
S05E15,ELAINE,"You guys are not gonna believe this. I just got a letter from a friend of mine in Chicago who was shopping, and she said she saw a mannequin that looked just like me. What if there're more. Where are they coming from?"
S05E15,RICKY'S BOSS,"Ricky, we've been getting a tremendous response to your TR-6 mannequin."
S05E15,RICKY,TR-6? I prefer to think of her as... Elaine.

S05E16,Opening Monolog,"The bus is the single stupidest, fattest, slowest, most despised vehicle on the road. Isn't it? You ever notice when you get behind the bus, people in your car go 'what are you doing? get away, come on.' The back of the bus is like an eclipse isn't it? people are just like 'the sun, where's the sun?' It's like this huge metal ass taking up the whole wind shield of your car. When it pulls out it even sounds like a fat uncle trying to get out of a sofa. (acts like he is trying to get out of a car and makes the sound of a bus/guy starting to get going)"

S05E16,GEORGE,"It's just not good, it's not good."
S05E16,JERRY,It's not good.
S05E16,GEORGE,"I'm bored. She's boring, I'm boring, we're both boring. We got out to eat, we both read newspapers."
S05E16,JERRY,Well at breakfast everybody reads.
S05E16,GEORGE,"No. Lunch we read, dinner we read."
S05E16,JERRY,You read during lunch?
S05E16,GEORGE,Ya
S05E16,JERRY,"Oh, well."
S05E16,GEORGE,There's nothing to talk about.
S05E16,JERRY,"Ya, what's there to talk about."
S05E16,GEORGE,Well at least you and I are talking about how there's nothing to talk about.
S05E16,JERRY,Why don't you talk to her about how there's nothing to talk about?
S05E16,GEORGE,She knows there is nothing to talk about.
S05E16,JERRY,At least you'll be talking.
S05E16,GEORGE,Oh shut up.
S05E16,AL,"Hey, look who's here."
S05E16,JERRY,"Hey, Al."
S05E16,GEORGE,"Hey, Al. How's it going?"
S05E16,AL,"(extremely happy) Deeply in love. We have soo many things to talk about. Sometimes we'll talk all night, till the sun comes up (pauses in his happiness; to George) so how about you?"
S05E16,GEORGE,"Oh I'm seeing someone, yes. You know her, Daphne Bower."
S05E16,AL,Great girl.
S05E16,GEORGE,We have no need to speak. We communicate with deep soulful looks.
S05E16,JERRY,Like Dwight and Mamie Eisenhower.
S05E16,AL,(to Jerry) Oh did you hear about Fulton?
S05E16,JERRY,Ya.
S05E16,AL,I went by the hospital to see him a few days ago (looking at Jerry) think he'd really like you to come visit.
S05E16,JERRY,Me?
S05E16,AL,"Ya, he said he could use a good laugh."
S05E16,GEORGE,What about me?
S05E16,AL,(to George) He didn't mention you. (Looks toward the front of the bus) This is my stop. Uh see ya.
S05E16,GEORGE,Ya
S05E16,JERRY,"Ya, see ya."
S05E16,GEORGE,"Deeply in love. If you can't say anything bad about a relationship, you shouldn't say anything at all."
S05E16,JERRY,(points to George) Ya.
S05E16,[Setting,Jerry's apartment]
S05E16,GEORGE,I didn't even know Fulton was in the hospital.
S05E16,JERRY,"Could use a good laugh. You know what kind of pressure that is? Come on, come with me."
S05E16,GEORGE,"Na no, I'm not good in these situations. I can't hide my pity. I..I make em feel worse."
S05E16,JERRY,"Oh, stop it."
S05E16,GEORGE,Ya and also I'm afraid that people in that state are finally going to tell me what they really think of me. You know they got nothing to lose what do they care?
S05E16,JERRY,So you're not gonna come?
S05E16,GEORGE,No but say hello for me.
S05E16,KRAMER,Hey!
S05E16,JERRY,Hey! Hey Mick.
S05E16,MICKEY,Hey Jerry.
S05E16,KRAMER,What's doing?
S05E16,JERRY,"Nothing, what's doing with you?"
S05E16,KRAMER,"Same old, same old."
S05E16,JERRY,George this is Mickey.
S05E16,GEORGE,"Hi, nice to meet you."
S05E16,MICKEY,Pleasure.
S05E16,JERRY,How's work going you guys?
S05E16,MICKEY,Lets not even talk about it.
S05E16,GEORGE,(to Kramer) You got a job?
S05E16,KRAMER,"Ya, Mickey. He hooked me up. We're stand-ins for the actors on 'All My Children.' Mickey, he's a stand-in for an eight year old kid and I stand in for the kids father."
S05E16,MICKEY,"(to Jerry then both Jerry and George) But I got a big problem. The kid I stand in for, he's growing. He was four feet last month, now he's like four-two and a half. He shot up two and a half inches. I can do four-two, four-three is a stretch, any higher than that and I'm gonna be out on my ass doing that para-legal crap."
S05E16,JERRY,How do you stop a kid from growing?
S05E16,KRAMER,"(to Mickey) I told you, you should offer him some cigarettes."
S05E16,MICKEY,"I offered him cigarettes, (to Jerry and George) but his stupid mother is hanging around. She won't let him have any."
S05E16,KRAMER,(to Mickey) What about lifts?
S05E16,MICKEY,(to Kramer) Out of the question.
S05E16,GEORGE,(to Mickey) Can't you just switch with another Midget?
S05E16,MICKEY,"(turns and moves up to George, points his finger at him) It's little people, you got that?"
S05E16,KRAMER,"Easy Mickey, easy."
S05E16,GEORGE,Yap..
S05E16,KRAMER,Alright we gotta get back to the show. What are you guys doing?
S05E16,JERRY,"I'm going to the hospital, to visit Fulton."
S05E16,KRAMER,"(on his way to the door) Oh, oh well say hello for me."
S05E16,KRAMER,"Now look, we're going to stop at the shoe maker right now. You gotta get some lifts for your shoes."
S05E16,MICKEY,"Lifts?! Look Kramer you don't understand, this kind of thing is just not done."
S05E16,KRAMER,You wanna keep your job don't you?
S05E16,MICKEY,Ya but..
S05E16,KRAMER,YAH! No Buts
S05E16,MICKEY,Kramer
S05E16,KRAMER,(with his hand in Mickey's face) YAAAAAH!
S05E16,JERRY,"Hey, woahoh Fulton. It's me."
S05E16,FULTON,"Hey Jerry, good to see ya. I could really use a good laugh."
S05E16,JERRY,Who couldn't.
S05E16,FULTON,I haven't cracked a smile in months.
S05E16,JERRY,"Oh don't worry, you'll crack. Cracking's inevitable, first you crack then you chuckle. That was the motto with the Russians at the Caesar Leningrad... first you crack then you chuckle. (Fulton looks at him not amused) You know because Leningrad when the Nazis attacked, it wasn't a very happy time... because of the war, famine, plus it was cold, very cold... they were eating each other. (Nervous under the pressure; Fulton not finding anything Jerry is saying funny) Maybe this isn't a good time for a visit."
S05E16,FULTON,It's a fine time.
S05E16,JERRY,"Oh, alright ah well... There's a priest, a minister and a rabbi, and they're all staring at him...."
S05E16,GEORGE,(sets down his paper) So how were the eggs?
S05E16,DAPHNE,Eggs are eggs.
S05E16,GEORGE,"(Not amused with her answer) Eggs are eggs. That is very profound. (laughs; Daphne goes back to reading her paper) By the same token you could say fish is fish. Ha ha ha, I don't think so. (pauses) Listen Dophne"
S05E16,DAPHNE,(correcting George) Daphne.
S05E16,GEORGE,"Daphne. I have to tell you something, this is very difficult..."
S05E16,DAPHNE,"(interrupts and hurriedly puts down her paper) Oh, I forgot to tell you. Al Netchie called me today."
S05E16,GEORGE,"Ya, ya. I bumped into him on the bus. What did he have to say?"
S05E16,DAPHNE,He told me not to get involved with you.
S05E16,GEORGE,What?
S05E16,DAPHNE,"Ya, he said you could never make a commitment to any one and you'd just wind up (reaches out and lightly slaps George's hand) hurting me."
S05E16,GEORGE,He said that? (Daphne shacks her head) What a nerve. How dare he say something like that.
S05E16,DAPHNE,Is it true?
S05E16,GEORGE,"Of course not. I mean sure, there may have been one or two occasions in the past, when I may have reacted in uh impulsive or somewhat immature manner, but those days are well behind me."

S05E16,GEORGE,Wa.. He doesn't have to tell her.
S05E16,ELAINE,Maybe he likes her.
S05E16,GEORGE,"Oh no no no. He's deeply in love, and I was just about to break up with her when she told me."
S05E16,JERRY,So what are you gonna do?
S05E16,GEORGE,Well I can't break up with her now.
S05E16,JERRY,Why?
S05E16,GEORGE,Because he said I was going to.
S05E16,ELAINE,"So now you're going to keep going out with her, for spite?"
S05E16,GEORGE,"Yes, I am."
S05E16,JERRY,"Ya, I could see that."
S05E16,GEORGE,I don't see any way around it.
S05E16,JERRY,"No, me either."
S05E16,GEORGE,What choice do I have?
S05E16,JERRY,None.

S05E16,[Setting,Jerry's Apartment]
S05E16,JERRY,Fulton's wife told me it's all my fault. She said since my visit he's taken a turn for the worse.
S05E16,KRAMER,Did you tell him the Packyderm story?
S05E16,JERRY,(yelling) Yes I told him the Packyderm story!
S05E16,KRAMER,Maybe I outta go over there.
S05E16,JERRY,Towards what end?
S05E16,KRAMER,"I'm very good with sick people. They love me. When my friend Len Nicodemo had the gout, I moved into his hospital room for three days, the doctors were amazed at his recovery."
S05E16,KRAMER,Hey.
S05E16,JERRY,Hey Mick.
S05E16,MICKEY,(to Kramer) Johnny Vigiano went through my locker.
S05E16,KRAMER,YAOH!
S05E16,MICKEY,(slamming the door) That little Bastard! He saw the lifts in my shoes. He knows I'm heightening. (to Kramer) This never would have happened if you hadn't pushed me to get those things. I told you.
S05E16,KRAMER,"Hey, nobody put a gun to your head."
S05E16,MICKEY,Ya well just keep out of my business you big ape. (pushes Kramer)
S05E16,KRAMER,Who you calling big ape? (pushes Mickey back)
S05E16,MICKEY,You (grabs Kramer)
S05E16,JERRY,"(starts pulling them apart) Alright break it up, break it up. Come on, just cut it out now (Kramer yells)"
S05E16,KRAMER,(pacing back and forth) Ya.
S05E16,MICKEY,I'm sorry Kramer.
S05E16,KRAMER,"No no it's alright, it's alright. You're stressed Oout!"
S05E16,JERRY,(to Mickey) Why does this guy Johnny have it in for you?
S05E16,MICKEY,"Oh, he's always been jealous of me. I always get to stand in for the bigger stars; The Cosby Kids, Ricky Schroder, Macaulay Culkin."
S05E16,KRAMER,(whistles) What's he like huh?
S05E16,MICKEY,He's a good kid.
S05E16,KRAMER,Ya?
S05E16,JERRY,So what does he care if you put lifts in?
S05E16,MICKEY,"You don't understand. There's an unwritten code about this kind of thing. I could be ostracized. I remember when I was a kid, some guy tried to heighten. He lost his job, lost his friends, Everything. Oh, I knew I was crazy to try this kind of thing, but I was so desperate. (pauses laying on the couch; jumps up) What is this kid taking anyway? Hormones? Steroids? Would you tell me!?"
S05E16,[Setting,George's car outside Daphne's place]
S05E16,DAPHNE,"George, tomorrow's Sunday. We could sleep late, and get the paper and half breakfast and spend the morning together, go for a long walk, maybe do a little shopping, have lunch..."
S05E16,GEORGE,(interrupts her) You know what. I don't think I'm going to be able to stay over tonight.
S05E16,DAPHNE,Why not?
S05E16,GEORGE,"I, I really should go home. Ya.. actually I'm planning on spending the day with my father tomorrow (short laugh) we're uh we're going to a father-son picnic, just the two of us."
S05E16,DAPHNE,I thought we were going to spend the day together.
S05E16,GEORGE,"Well Dad's been planning this for such a long time, he bought a new blanket, and he got tha...that game with foam paddles and the velcro ball. (laughs)"
S05E16,DAPHNE,"Have you given any more thought to what we talked about? You know, moving in?"
S05E16,GEORGE,"Yes, oh yes very much."
S05E16,DAPHNE,Maybe you don't want to move in.
S05E16,GEORGE,"No, no I do. You know it's just..."
S05E16,DAPHNE,"(interrupting him) Maybe Al Netchie was right, maybe I shouldn't have gotten involved with you."
S05E16,GEORGE,(angry that she believes Al was right) No he's not right. Al Netchie is not right! Alright I'm canceling the father-son picnic. I don't know what he's gonna do with all that potato salad.

S05E16,PHIL,(dying of laughter) I'm peeing in my pants.
S05E16,ELAINE,"(cont.) they go flying out of his hands, and one lands on her face and the other lands on his face. (pause as they both continue to laugh really hard) and the whole place went crazy."
S05E16,PHIL,"Oh, I'm sorry, Oh. What a story."
S05E16,ELAINE,"I know, I know, I was unbelievable"
S05E16,PHIL,Oh that is one of the funniest stories I've ever heard.
S05E16,ELAINE,(wipes her eyes because she laughed so hard she cried) I know.
S05E16,PHIL,Well this has been one hell of a night.
S05E16,ELAINE,"Oh, I'm sorry Jerry didn't suggest this sooner."
S05E16,PHIL,"You know, you really are beautiful Elaine."
S05E16,ELAINE,"Oh, well, (pauses) Good night."

S05E16,ELAINE,It.
S05E16,JERRY,"He took It, Out?"
S05E16,ELAINE,Yessiree Bob.
S05E16,JERRY,He couldn't.
S05E16,ELAINE,He did.

S05E16,ELAINE,Yes.
S05E16,JERRY,Are you sure?
S05E16,ELAINE,Oh quite.
S05E16,JERRY,There was no mistaking it?

S05E16,JERRY,"So you were talking, (Elaine makes an agreement sound ""mmm"") you're having pleasant conversation, (Elaine makes an agreement sound ""mmm"") then all of sudden..."

S05E16,ELAINE,Oh it be. (sarcastically) You got any other friends you want to set me up with?
S05E16,KRAMER,Hey. (to Elaine) Hey how was your date with Phil Titola?
S05E16,ELAINE,(to Kramer) He took it out.
S05E16,KRAMER,"Maybe uh, it needed some air. You know sometimes they need air, they can't breathe in there. It's in human."

S05E16,JERRY,Alright I'm going.
S05E16,GEORGE,You know what I've come to realize? I'm not just bored. I genuinely dislike her.
S05E16,JERRY,Well how long you are going to keep this up?
S05E16,GEORGE,Hey I'll get married if I have to. Al Netchie will think twice before he opens his mouth about me again.
S05E16,JERRY,You know George they are doing wonderful things at mental institutions these days. I'd be happy to set-up a meet and greet.
S05E16,GEORGE,I'm very disappointed to here you talk like that. You still don't know what makes me tick.
S05E16,JERRY,Yes I do.

S05E16,TAMMY,(recoils) Don't touch me. You ought to be ashamed of yourself. All the progress we made over the years and you go and blow it by pulling a stupid stunt like this.
S05E16,MICKEY,"Wait a second, wait a second, you got me all wrong. It was all because of the kid. (numerous little people begin to crowd around them) (to Tammy) The kid was growing. He shot up two and a half inches in a month. (to all the little people) I woulda lost my job. Any one of you would have done the same. You got no right! I'm Mickey Abbott! I stood in for Punky Bruster when all of you was nothing. (seeing the crowd still doesn't agree with what he did, he points at Kramer) It's all his fault.

S05E17,JERRY,"Ohhh, moisture?"
S05E17,ELAINE,Yeah. Definite moisture.
S05E17,JERRY,"That's an open-lip kiss, alright."

S05E17,GEORGE,"Anyway, I think the guy in the shower opposite saw me. He gave me a dirty look."
S05E17,ELAINE,You went...in the shower?
S05E17,GEORGE,"Yeah, so what? I'm not the only one! (Kramer enters with his quilt.)"
S05E17,ELAINE (to Jerry),Do you go in the shower?
S05E17,JERRY,"No, never."
S05E17,ELAINE (to Kramer),Do you?
S05E17,KRAMER,I take baths.
S05E17,GEORGE,"Well, what was I supposed to do? Get out of the shower, put on my bathrobe? Go all the way down to the other end? Come all the way back?"
S05E17,ELAINE,Did you ever hear of...holding it in?
S05E17,GEORGE,"Oh, no...no, that's very bad for the kidneys."
S05E17,ELAINE,How do you know?
S05E17,GEORGE,Medical journals!
S05E17,JERRY,Do the medical journals mention anything about standing in a pool of someone else's urine?
S05E17,JERRY,Hello.
S05E17,MERYL,"Oh, hi...honey."
S05E17,JERRY,What are you doing here?
S05E17,MERYL,I just thought I'd drop off a few things.
S05E17,JERRY,"Oh. (Smiles at Marty nervously.) Well, I must have been in the incinerator room when you left. Here you go, Marty. (Hands over Kramer's quilt.)"
S05E17,MARTY,Another quilt? Huh? (Uncle Leo enters.)
S05E17,UNCLE LEO,Jerry!
S05E17,JERRY,Uncle Leo?!
S05E17,UNCLE LEO,Hello!
S05E17,JERRY,Hello.
S05E17,MARTY (to Jerry),"So, if you or your wife want to drop by on Wednesday, it should be ready."
S05E17,UNCLE LEO,Your wife?
S05E17,JERRY (hoping Leo will pick up on the scam),Yeah...my wife.
S05E17,UNCLE LEO,What are you talking about?
S05E17,JERRY,Uh...I got married.
S05E17,UNCLE LEO (shocked),You got married? I wasn't invited? Nobody sends me an invitation?
S05E17,JERRY,"Well, it was sudden."
S05E17,UNCLE LEO,Are you ashamed of your uncle? Do I embarrass you?
S05E17,JERRY,"No, no, it was a small ceremony."
S05E17,UNCLE LEO,Haven't I always been a good uncle?
S05E17,JERRY,"Yes, yes, you have."
S05E17,UNCLE LEO,Who told you when you went to school that you print well?
S05E17,JERRY,"You did, you did."
S05E17,UNCLE LEO (to Meryl),"When he was younger, he had a beautiful penmanship. I used to encourage him to print."
S05E17,JERRY,I'm a good printer.
S05E17,UNCLE LEO,"I remember your 'V.' It was like a perfect triangle. Whoa, there's my bus! (Rushes out.) Hello! Wait!"
S05E17,JERRY,"Uncle Leo, wait!"
S05E17,GREG,I'm glad you're here. This can get really boring. Do you know where I can get some good olives?
S05E17,ELAINE,I can find out.
S05E17,GREG,Would ya?
S05E17,ELAINE,"Sure. (thinking) Ooh, a project. That's a definite signal."
S05E17,GREG,"By the way, you look really great in that leotard."
S05E17,ELAINE,"Oh, thanks. (thinking) That's no signal, who wouldn't like me in this leotard? I look amazing in this leotard."
S05E17,GREG,"Hey, you know what's weird? I think I had a dream about you last night."
S05E17,ELAINE,"(thinking) Okay, he open-lips me, he dreams about me, we have an olive project...that's it, I'm asking this guy out. (to Greg) Um, you know Greg, I..."
S05E17,GREG,Can I have a sip of your water?
S05E17,ELAINE,"Oh, yeah, sure. (Hands Greg her bottle.)"
S05E17,GREG,"Thanks. (Is about to take a drink, but wipes the neck of the bottle with his shirt first.)"
S05E17,ELAINE,(shocked expression; thinking) Oh my God.
S05E17,GREG (hands the bottle back),"I'm sorry, what were you saying?"
S05E17,ELAINE,"Oh, it was nothing, for-forget it. (George enters the gym.)"
S05E17,GREG,See that guy right there?
S05E17,ELAINE,"Yup, you mean him?"
S05E17,GREG,"I caught him urinating in the shower. I'm thinking about turning him in, too."
S05E17,MERYL,Honey? Could you get me something to drink?
S05E17,"JERRY (from his bedroom hallway, alluding to the fact that she should get the drink herself)",You're right there.
S05E17,MERYL,"C'mon, I'm sitting! (Jerry walks to the kitchen, annoyed. Meryl laughs at the TV show she's watching.)"
S05E17,JERRY (looking in a drawer),"Honey, what'd you do with the can opener?"
S05E17,MERYL,I didn't do anything with it.
S05E17,JERRY,"Well, it's not here, it was here yesterday."
S05E17,MERYL,It's in the first drawer.
S05E17,JERRY,I'm looking in the first drawer. It's not here.
S05E17,MERYL,"Yes, it is."
S05E17,JERRY (irritated),"Hey...I'm not stupid. I'm looking in that drawer, there's no can opener."
S05E17,MERYL,Did I say you were stupid?
S05E17,JERRY (angrily),"Well, wouldn't I have to be? You tell me there's a can opener in the drawer, I'm looking in the drawer, there's no can opener - what other conclusion could one reach? (The phone rings.)"
S05E17,MERYL (getting up),Do you want me to go find it?
S05E17,JERRY (slams the drawer),"Yes. I do. You show me where there's a can opener in that drawer. (Answers the phone.) Hello! I'm sorry, I'm just fighting with my wife."
S05E17,HELEN,"Jerry, we just heard, what's going on?"
S05E17,MORTY,Why the hell didn't you tell us?
S05E17,JERRY,"Listen, Ma..."
S05E17,MERYL (looking in the drawer),It was in here yesterday!
S05E17,JERRY (angrily),"Yeah, that's what I said!"
S05E17,HELEN,Who is she? When did this happen?
S05E17,MORTY (to Jerry),I told her you'd get married. She thought you'd never do it.
S05E17,HELEN,"Morty, you're talking too loud."
S05E17,MORTY,I'm not talking loud!
S05E17,HELEN,You're hurting my eardrum.
S05E17,MERYL (looking for the can opener),"Well, you must have done something with it!"
S05E17,JERRY (to Meryl),I'm on the phone!
S05E17,HELEN,Is she there? Can we talk to her? What's her name?
S05E17,JERRY,"Mom, I'm not married."
S05E17,HELEN,What?
S05E17,JERRY,I'm not married!
S05E17,MORTY,"I knew it, I told you!"
S05E17,HELEN (to Jerry),Uncle Leo said.
S05E17,JERRY,I'm just pretending I'm married to get a discount on dry-cleaning.
S05E17,HELEN,A discount on dry-cleaning?
S05E17,"JERRY (to Meryl, who's making a racket in the kitchen looking for the can opener)","Could you make a little more noise? (To his parents) Listen, I'm gonna have to call you later."
S05E17,MERYL (not finding the opener),"Well, I give up."
S05E17,JERRY,"Well, whoopie whoop. (Meryl goes into the other room. Kramer staggers in the door in his bathrobe.)"
S05E17,KRAMER,Got any coffee?
S05E17,JERRY,"Yeah. (Kramer lurches into the kitchen, trips, and falls onto the kitchen floor.) I'll get it, I'll get it! Take it easy, why are you so tired?"
S05E17,KRAMER,"My quilt is still at the cleaners. Jerry, I can't sleep without my quilt. Like the other night? I was cold. So, last night, I turn up the heat - it's too hot. I open up a window - it's too cold. (Frantic) I can't get into a zone!"
S05E17,JERRY,What is that? (Points to Kramer's pocket as Meryl comes back.)
S05E17,KRAMER,Huh?
S05E17,JERRY,That?
S05E17,KRAMER,"Oh, I forgot. (Hands back Jerry's can opener.)"
S05E17,JERRY,"Hey, I'm sorry about all that can opener stuff."
S05E17,MERYL,"Yeah, me too. I Love you."
S05E17,JERRY,I Love you.
S05E17,MERYL,"Well, goodnight."
S05E17,JERRY,"Goodnight. (They kiss goodnight, then promptly roll away from each other and go to sleep.)"
S05E17,GEORGE,They could kick me out of the health club if he tells them!
S05E17,ELAINE,So what do you want me to do?
S05E17,GEORGE,Talk to him!
S05E17,ELAINE,How can I do that?
S05E17,GEORGE,You said the guy gave you an open-lipped kiss!
S05E17,ELAINE (enunciating clearly so George gets the point),"Yes, but then he wiped his hand on the top of the bottle when I offered him water!"
S05E17,GEORGE,"Well, that doesn't mean anything!"
S05E17,ELAINE,"Are you kidding? That's very significant! If he was interested in me, he'd want my germs! He'd just crave my germs!"
S05E17,JERRY (patiently while watching tv),"She's right, George. Bottle-wipe is big."
S05E17,GEORGE,"Well, what about the open-lipped kiss?"
S05E17,JERRY,(still watching tv; sounds like basketball) Bottle-wipe supercedes it.
S05E17,GEORGE,"Yeah, you're right, you're right. (To Elaine) Alright, maybe he's not interested, but you still know him - can't you just ask him?"
S05E17,ELAINE,"George...but if I ask him now, I will have no chance of going out with him."
S05E17,GEORGE,Why?
S05E17,ELAINE,I...I don't know...
S05E17,GEORGE,"Aha. Aha. Could it be because you don't want him to know that you have a friend who pees in the shower, is that it?!"
S05E17,ELAINE,"No, that's not it!"
S05E17,GEORGE,"Oh, I think it is! I think that's exactly what it is!"
S05E17,ELAINE,Why couldn't you just wait?
S05E17,GEORGE,I was there! I saw a drain!
S05E17,ELAINE,Since when is a drain a toilet?!
S05E17,GEORGE,It's all pipes! What's the difference?!
S05E17,ELAINE,Different pipes go to different places! You're gonna mix 'em up!
S05E17,GEORGE,I'll call a plumber right now! (Goes for the phone.)
S05E17,JERRY,"Alright, can we just drop all the pee-pipe stuff here?"
S05E17,ELAINE (to George),"Okay! Okay! Okay, I will talk to him. (Kramer enters.)"
S05E17,KRAMER,"Jerry, I think that quilt is ready."
S05E17,JERRY,Alright.
S05E17,KRAMER,"Well, you gotta pick it up for me!"
S05E17,JERRY,"Alright, I'll pick it up, but it's the last time I'm doin' it!"
S05E17,KRAMER,I'm so tired!
S05E17,ELAINE (to Kramer),"Boy, you don't look good."
S05E17,KRAMER,Huh? I don't?
S05E17,ELAINE,"No, you look pale."
S05E17,KRAMER,Pale? Oh my God...I gotta meet Anna's parents today! (The phone rings.)
S05E17,JERRY,"Hello? Oh, hi honey. (annoyed, weary) Yes, I told him. I'll get it. (George and Elaine give each other a look, then leave Jerry to argue with Meryl on the phone.) Whenever. Okay, I'm sorry..."
S05E17,MARTY,"I'm sorry, it's not ready yet. (Kramer bursts in.)"
S05E17,KRAMER,Not ready? It has to be ready! What kind of a business are you running here?
S05E17,MARTY,"Who the hell are you? Huh, It's not your quilt."
S05E17,JERRY,"He's a very good friend of mine, he's kind've like an older brother to me...when things don't go right, he kinda takes it personally."
S05E17,MARTY,"Well, uh...maybe tomorrow."
S05E17,"KRAMER (angrily, to Jerry)",Maybe.
S05E17,JERRY,"Oh, it's okay, it'll be okay."
S05E17,KRAMER,"Alright, I'm gonna see you later."
S05E17,JERRY,Where you goin'?
S05E17,KRAMER,"I gotta meet Anna's parents today, remember? I look terrible! I'm gonna hit the tanning machines."
S05E17,JERRY,I can't believe you still do that. You know those things are bad for ya.
S05E17,KRAMER,"Hey, that's how I maintain my glow."
S05E17,JERRY,I'm goin' home.
S05E17,KRAMER,Ya.
S05E17,"PAULA (to Marty, in a foreign accent)","Excuse me? Uh, how much would it cost to clean this?"
S05E17,MARTY,"Oh, about thirteen dollars."
S05E17,PAULA,"Thirteen? Well, I can't afford that."
S05E17,MARTY,"Well, I'm sorry."
S05E17,ELAINE,"Hi, Greg."
S05E17,GREG,"Hey, Elaine. I'll be off in a second."
S05E17,ELAINE,"Ok. (Another guy approaches the exercise machine.) I got the machine next, buddy. (Greg finishes up his workout and gets off the machine.)"
S05E17,GREG (to Elaine),"Oh, well, It's all yours. (Walks away. Elaine looks at the machine, then George runs over.)"
S05E17,GEORGE,What happened? Did he bring it up?
S05E17,ELAINE,"Never mind that, look at the signal I just got."
S05E17,GEORGE,Signal? What signal?
S05E17,ELAINE,"Lookit. He knew I was gonna use the machine next, he didn't wipe his sweat off. That's a gesture of intimacy."
S05E17,GEORGE,I'll tell you what that is - that's a violation of club rules. Now I got him! And you're my witness!
S05E17,ELAINE,"Listen, George! Listen! He knew what he was doing, this was a signal."
S05E17,GEORGE,"A guy leaves a puddle of sweat, that's a signal?"
S05E17,ELAINE,Yeah! It's a social thing.
S05E17,GEORGE,"What if he left you a used Kleenex, what's that, a valentine? Now you go up to him and you tell him that if he's thinking of turning me in, that I got the goods on him!"
S05E17,ELAINE,No! I won't be a party to this.
S05E17,GEORGE,So you're gonna let me get suspended for shower urination?
S05E17,ELAINE,"Okay, I'll talk to him. But you're putting me in a very difficult position. (Walks away.)"
S05E17,PAULA,I won't let you do this!
S05E17,JERRY,I want to!
S05E17,PAULA,But it isn't right! I can't.
S05E17,JERRY,Give me the clothes.
S05E17,PAULA,"Jerry, please. What about her?"
S05E17,JERRY,"Oh, the hell with her. (Paula dramatically flees from the coffee shop. Jerry thinks for a second, then follows her and catches up to her on the street.)"
S05E17,PAULA,"No, Jerry, please!"
S05E17,JERRY,I'm not gonna let you walk out of my life.
S05E17,PAULA (hands over the clothes),I can't fight you. (They embrace and kiss passionately.)
S05E17,JERRY,Do you want box or hanger?
S05E17,PAULA,You decide. (Jerry considers.)
S05E17,ELAINE,"You're really working up quite a sweat today, huh?"
S05E17,GREG,"Yeah. (Spies the shapely manager of the health club.) Oh, there's the manager. Good. I think I'm gonna talk to her about that guy, you know, we cannot have people like that in here."
S05E17,ELAINE,Are you sure you want to do that?
S05E17,GREG,"Yeah. He's disgusting! Besides, I'll take any chance I can to talk to her."
S05E17,ELAINE,You're interested in...in her? (Points at the manager.)
S05E17,GREG,Very.
S05E17,ELAINE,"Ah. You know, uh..I'm engaged. (preens) Yep, gettin' married in fifty years. (Snaps the straps of her leotard against her chest and winces. George walks by the manager.)"
S05E17,GREG,"Oh good, there he is. I wanna be able to point him out."
S05E17,ELAINE,"You know, Greg, I wouldn't do that if I were you."
S05E17,GREG,Why?
S05E17,ELAINE,"Well, correct me if I'm wrong, but isn't it a violation of club policy to not wipe down a machine after using it?"
S05E17,GREG,"Oh, I see...you're friends with the urinator, aren't you?"
S05E17,ELAINE,"Yeah, well, at least he had a drain."
S05E17,MARTY,"Here you go, Mrs. Seinfeld...with your 25% discount, it comes to $17.80."
S05E17,MERYL,"Here you go. (Pays Marty, then looks at the clothes on the hanger.) Excuse me, this isn't mine."
S05E17,MARTY,"Oh, yes it is. Your husband brought it in himself."
S05E17,MERYL,Really? (Takes her change and grabs the clothes off the hanger.) Thank you. (Exits.)
S05E17,ANNA,"That's him! (Opens the door. Kramer stands there, deeply tanned and smiling. Anna and her grandfather are shocked.)"
S05E17,MERYL (throws Paula's clothes at Jerry),You son of a bitch!
S05E17,JERRY,I'm sorry.
S05E17,MERYL,Who is she? I want to know who she is.
S05E17,JERRY,It doesn't matter. I want a divorce.
S05E17,MERYL,"A divorce? Oh, so you can marry her and give her the discount?"
S05E17,JERRY,"Yes, that's right."
S05E17,MERYL,"What happened to us, Jerry?"
S05E17,JERRY,I'll tell you what happened. We got married.
S05E17,MERYL,"I'm sorry, uh.. this is my fault. I pushed it on you."
S05E17,JERRY,No. I guess I just wasn't ready for the responsibilities of a pretend marriage.
S05E17,MERYL,"Goodbye, Jerry. Oh, I forgot...(reaches in her purse)...this is your maple syrup."
S05E17,JERRY,"It's alright, I want you to have it."
S05E17,MERYL,"(sentimental) Okay, thanks."
S05E17,JERRY,We'll always have...pancakes.
S05E17,MERYL,"Bye, Jerry. (Exits.)"
S05E17,GRANDPA (to Anna),I thought you said you was bringin' a white boy home! I don't see a white boy! I see a damn fool!
S05E18,JERRY,You know their timing couldn't be worse.
S05E18,GEORGE,Is there ever a good time to have your parents stay with you?
S05E18,JERRY,"You don't understand, I haven't been together with Rachel for like three weeks. First I was on the road, then my parents show up, I'm getting a little uh backed up."
S05E18,GEORGE,When are they leaving for Paris?
S05E18,JERRY,Not for another three days.
S05E18,GEORGE,What about her place?
S05E18,JERRY,She lives with her parents.
S05E18,GEORGE,"Really? (Jerry shakes his head) Maybe this will become like a cool thing, living with your parents."
S05E18,JERRY,"(sarcastically) Ya, then maybe baldness will catch on. This will all be turning your way."
S05E18,GEORGE,"Hey believe me, baldness will catch on. When the aliens come, who do you think they're gonna relate to? Who do you think is going to be the first ones getting a tour of the ship?"
S05E18,JERRY,The baldies
S05E18,GEORGE,Hey by the way my parents really want to have your parents over dinner before they leave town.
S05E18,JERRY,"That's good, then I get the apartment for at least one night. You know I'm paying for this whole Paris trip it's their anniversary present."
S05E18,ALEC,(walking over to Jerry and George's table) Hey guys.
S05E18,GEORGE,Hey Alec
S05E18,JERRY,Hey Alec
S05E18,ALEC,This is Joey.
S05E18,GEORGE,"Hey Joey, how you doin'?"
S05E18,ALEC,"(Joey was about to talk) Hey listen, I was wondering if either one of you guys would be interested in doing some work for the Big Brother program? I'm kinda running the local chapter. What do you say George?"
S05E18,GEORGE,Well uh....
S05E18,JOEY,(interrupts) Wouldn't you like to be a big brother to someone like me? Please?
S05E18,GEORGE,"Well, sure Joey, sure, I would be thrilled."
S05E18,ALEC,"That's great George, thanks a lot I'll get in touch with you."
S05E18,JOEY,Wouldn't you like to be a big brother..
S05E18,ALEC,"(grabs Joey to stop him) Ya alright Joey that's enough, let's go (walking over to the counter) See ya."
S05E18,JERRY,What happened?
S05E18,GEORGE,What could I do? Did you see the mug on that kid?
S05E18,JERRY,(acting like Joey) Wouldn't you like to pass the ketchup to someone like me? Please?
S05E18,JERRY,Hey did you notice they moved where they do the interview on Jeopardy now?
S05E18,GEORGE,Ya it used to be right in the middle of single Jeopardy and now they do it right after single Jeopardy.
S05E18,JERRY,"Ya, it's much better isn't it?"
S05E18,GEORGE,"Oh, n-no comparison."
S05E18,JERRY,"Hey, I gotta stop off at the bookstore to pick up my parents one of those French-English dictionaries."
S05E18,GEORGE,(stops Jerry realizing something) Hey hey hey hey hey hey.
S05E18,JERRY,What?
S05E18,GEORGE,Your parents are going to Paris right?
S05E18,JERRY,Yea?
S05E18,GEORGE,So I tell Alec that I have to go to Paris for an undetermined amount of time. Then all I have to do is buy some post cards and have your parents mail them from Paris.
S05E18,JERRY,What about little Joey?
S05E18,GEORGE,Who?
S05E18,JERRY,"Ah, I think he's probably better off."
S05E18,GEORGE,I'm trying to get out of this Big Brother program. So when you get to Paris (handing Morty the postcards) all you have to do is drop 'em in any mailbox.
S05E18,MORTY,But there are no stamps on these.
S05E18,GEORGE,"Well no not yet, you gotta buy french stamps (pauses) I-I'll reimburse you of course."
S05E18,HELEN,Why are you doing this?
S05E18,JERRY,He wants this guy to think he's in Paris.
S05E18,HELEN,Why?
S05E18,JERRY,Because George is a deeply disturbed individual.
S05E18,KRAMER,"Oh hey, Helen uh, Could I uh, use some more of your hand lotion?"
S05E18,HELEN,I told you it was good. (hands Kramer the lotion)
S05E18,KRAMER,(putting on the lotion) Ya
S05E18,HELEN,It's from the Saks Fifth Avenue in Miami.
S05E18,KRAMER,Mmm (smelling the lotion as he rubs it in) I'm gonna remember that if I'm ever in Florida.
S05E18,JERRY,"Ya, or if you're ever on Fifth Avenue here in New York City, you could get some there."
S05E18,KRAMER,Ya
S05E18,MORTY,Say those are some nice pants. I got a pair just like them at home.
S05E18,KRAMER,"Well uh that doesn't surprise me, ya i bought these at Rudy's. It's a used clothing store. See when people like you die, the widows they bring in their wardrobes, they make a bundle."
S05E18,GEORGE,"Really? My father has a ton of old clothes just sitting up in the attic, y-you think they're worth something?"
S05E18,KRAMER,"Ya if they're vintage, and you're a widow."
S05E18,GEORGE,"What happens if the husband dies after the wife, who brings in the clothing in then?"
S05E18,KRAMER,Well I suppose the children do.
S05E18,GEORGE,(pondering) Yes I suppose they do.
S05E18,KRAMER,"(takes another smell of his hands) Alright I gotta a ten o'clock, I'll see everybody later."
S05E18,GEORGE,"(grabbing his jacket) Hey oo, I just remembered uh my parents really wanna have you guys over for dinner before you leave town. What about tonight?"
S05E18,HELEN,Tonight?
S05E18,GEORGE,Yea they're making Paella.
S05E18,HELEN,"(looking at Morty) Uh oh I don't think we think we can make it tonight, (turns toward George) we have plans."
S05E18,JERRY,(watching the whole conversation from his desk) What plans?
S05E18,HELEN,(turns to Jerry) We have plans.
S05E18,JERRY,Where'd you get plans?
S05E18,HELEN,(annoyed) We have plans.
S05E18,GEORGE,"Well um, what about tomorrow night?"
S05E18,HELEN,(turns back toward George) Maybe
S05E18,GEORGE,"Ok uh, I guess I'll tell them that."
S05E18,MORTY,(to George as he is about to leave) Hey give 'em our best though.
S05E18,GEORGE,(quietly) Ya.
S05E18,JERRY,(walking over toward George and the door) I'll call you later.
S05E18,GEORGE,Ya.
S05E18,JERRY,So what plans do you have?
S05E18,MORTY,None
S05E18,JERRY,So how come you're not going over there for dinner?
S05E18,HELEN,Jerry we don't care much for the Costanzas'.
S05E18,MORTY,We can't stand them.
S05E18,JERRY,Really? Since when?
S05E18,HELEN,Since always. We've never liked them.
S05E18,JERRY,Why?
S05E18,HELEN,"Well they're so loud, they're always fighting it's uncomfortable, you never notice?"
S05E18,JERRY,No I notice but they're from your age group I didn't know you could detect abnormal behavior among your own kind.
S05E18,MORTY,Well we do.
S05E18,JERRY,Ya?
S05E18,ELAINE,It's us.
S05E18,JERRY,U-oh come on up. (buzzes them up) It's Elaine you don't have a problem with her do you?
S05E18,HELEN,We adore Elaine.
S05E18,JERRY,"She wants to say hi, she's with her new boyfriend."
S05E18,HELEN,What's he like?
S05E18,JERRY,"He's nice, bit of a close talker."
S05E18,HELEN,A what?
S05E18,JERRY,"You'll see. (pause) Boy, I had no idea you felt this way about the Costanzas'"
S05E18,HELEN,They're exhausting it's like being in an Asylum.
S05E18,EVERYONE,Hi.
S05E18,MORTY,Hello Elaine
S05E18,ELAINE,This is Aaron.
S05E18,HELEN,Hello Aaron
S05E18,MORTY,Hello.
S05E18,AARON,(getting up in Helen's face) So how long you folks in town?
S05E18,HELEN,"Oh, three more days, three more days then we're off to Paris."
S05E18,AARON,Ah
S05E18,MORTY,We're going with a select charter group.
S05E18,AARON,"I love France, (moving over to Morty's face) I was just there last year. In fact, you know I still have an envelope full of French Franks, I'll give 'em to ya."
S05E18,HELEN,We can't take money.
S05E18,AARON,"Oh, no, it's a gift. (looking toward Elaine) from us."
S05E18,ELAINE,"Oh, that is soo nice (very elaborate nice) Aaron. Isn't he nice? (to Helen) So listen has Jerry been showin' you a good time?"
S05E18,JERRY,No I haven't.
S05E18,AARON,You know (to Morty) I have a friend who works at the Metropolitan Museum of Art. How would you like a behind the scenes tour?
S05E18,HELEN,"(grabbing Aaron) Really, you could do that?"
S05E18,AARON,(up in Helen's face) Easily
S05E18,HELEN,I wouldn't be any trouble?
S05E18,AARON,(gets closer) Of course not.
S05E18,HELEN,When would we go?
S05E18,AARON,How about right now?
S05E18,MORTY,I'm ready
S05E18,HELEN,Are you sure?
S05E18,AARON,Yes.
S05E18,HELEN,"Ok, let me get my coat."
S05E18,AARON,(walking over to Elaine and getting into her face) Elaine what do you say?
S05E18,ELAINE,"W-well I don't think so Aaron, uh, I have plans."
S05E18,AARON,Oh. (getting into Jerry's face) How about you Jerry?
S05E18,JERRY,I'm swamped.
S05E18,AARON,You sure? You could examine the art work up close.
S05E18,JERRY,Maybe I'll try and catch up with you.
S05E18,ELAINE,(under her breath) Ya that'll happen)
S05E18,AARON,(Moving toward the door) Alright. We're off.
S05E18,MORTY,"Ok, bye."
S05E18,HELEN & AARON,Bye.
S05E18,JERRY,Ok buh bye. Have a good time.
S05E18,ELAINE,Bye.
S05E18,AARON,See everybody later (Morty and Helen leave; Aaron closes the door blowing Elaine a kiss)
S05E18,JERRY,Ok.
S05E18,ELAINE,Why would he ask your parents to go to a museum?
S05E18,JERRY,I don't know.
S05E18,ELAINE,What is that?
S05E18,JERRY,Maybe he was just trying to be nice.
S05E18,ELAINE,Have you ever heard of anyone doing anything like this?
S05E18,JERRY,"Wait a second, he just did me a big favor."
S05E18,ELAINE,What?
S05E18,JERRY,(dialing) He got em out of the house.
S05E18,ELAINE,What?
S05E18,JERRY,Call Rachel.
S05E18,ELAINE,Oh.
S05E18,JERRY,"(on the phone) ah no, I got the machine. Rachel! Are you there?! I got the place to myself for a few hours! Rachel! Where are you? Rachel! (hangs up the phone very disappointed)"
S05E18,ELAINE,"(putting on lipstick) Sorry pal, wish I could help you out."
S05E18,FRANK,They're not coming?
S05E18,GEORGE,"No, they had plans."
S05E18,ESTELLE,How could they have plans?
S05E18,GEORGE,That's what I wanna know.
S05E18,FRANK,"Well what difference does it make? They wouldn't lie to us, they're are dear friends."
S05E18,ESTELLE,What am I supposed to do with all this Paella?
S05E18,GEORGE,"They said tomorrow, maybe."
S05E18,FRANK,Maybe?
S05E18,ESTELLE,Maybe they don't like us.
S05E18,FRANK,Why wouldn't they like us? (tastes the Paella; disgusted) Again with the pepper? What do you gotta use all the pepper for?
S05E18,ESTELLE,Ah keep quiet.
S05E18,FRANK,What are you trying to set my mouth on fire?
S05E18,GEORGE,I don't know what the reason could be.
S05E18,JERRY,"(disappointed) Oh, Hi, hi."
S05E18,AARON,Ah Jerry you would not believe the time we had.
S05E18,HELEN,Aaron is quite the tour guide.
S05E18,MORTY,Jerry have you ever seen any of those impressionist paintings?
S05E18,JERRY,Oh sure like Monet.
S05E18,MORTY,Don't you think he had to be uh near sighted? I mean know body would paint like that if they could see. It's all out of focus.
S05E18,JERRY,"Well he's from the impressionist school, you know like Monet, Manet, Tippi Tippi Dayday."
S05E18,MORTY,I say the guy was painting without his glasses.
S05E18,JERRY,"(answering phone) Hello? Rachel, ya uh no they're back."
S05E18,HELEN,Jerry if you have something to do we could just sit right here and read.
S05E18,JERRY,"Uh haha ya well uh I'm sorry too I'll call you later, ok bye (hangs phone up)"
S05E18,AARON,Well I should be going.
S05E18,HELEN,Oh thanks again.
S05E18,AARON & HELEN,Buh bye.
S05E18,AARON,Oh you must be Kramer (advances on Kramer to close to his face Kramer walks back into the fridge to avoid him and falls to the ground) I've heard about you.
S05E18,KRAMER,"You must be Aaron, I've heard about you."
S05E18,AARON,(Laughing) Well see you later.
S05E18,KRAMER,Yeah.
S05E18,AARON,(leaving) Bye
S05E18,JERRY,Bye
S05E18,KRAMER,So uh what are you guys doing for dinner?
S05E18,HELEN,We have no plans.
S05E18,MORTY,"(noticing Kramer's coat) Look at that, Helen do you see what he's wearing? That's the Executive."
S05E18,KRAMER,Now what is Executive?
S05E18,JERRY,The belt-less trench coat. My father invented it.
S05E18,MORTY,"I sure did. Raincoats were my business. The Executive was a classic, these haven't been made in twenty years."
S05E18,HELEN,Why would they? Know body bought them then.
S05E18,MORTY,He's wearing one.
S05E18,KRAMER,Yea these are a hot item over at Rudy's.
S05E18,MORTY,You don't say? You know I have boxes of those sitting in my garage in Florida?
S05E18,KRAMER,Get 'em up here. You give me twenty-five percent I-I'll take care of everything.
S05E18,MORTY,You gotta deal.
S05E18,KRAMER,Yaaaa.
S05E18,JERRY,This is like the meeting of Smith and Wesson.
S05E18,MORTY,"I'll call Jack Klompus, he's got a key to the garage. He can send them overnight delivery."
S05E18,HELEN,You're gonna first start shipping boxes? We're leaving for Paris in three days.
S05E18,MORTY,He'll send them express.
S05E18,HELEN,You're crazy.
S05E18,MORTY,"I'll tell you how crazy I am, I'm gonna pay for this whole trip with these coats."
S05E18,JERRY,N-na I'm paying for the trip.
S05E18,MORTY,So much the better.
S05E18,GEORGE,Anyway it's kind of a fluke thing but uh I'll be leaving for Paris in two days. I will send you a postcard when I get there.
S05E18,ALEC,Paris huh?
S05E18,GEORGE,"Yea, ya..ya know I feel terrible about Joey but it's jus..it's a great business opportunity. I-I don't even know how long I'm gonna be away for."
S05E18,ALEC,Where will you stay?
S05E18,GEORGE,"An apartment complex, the uh the Eiffel Towers. uumm Like I said uh you'll be getting a postcard uh in a few days and again I'm sorry."
S05E18,ALEC,"George, you have no idea how fantastic this is."
S05E18,GEORGE,Fantastic?
S05E18,ALEC,"Ya, we've been trying to reunite Joey with his father who lives in Paris. But he's afraid to fly alone, you know he's kinda withdrawn, but he seems to take to you. (George smiling in surprise) So it's a perfect solution."
S05E18,GEORGE,How gee what a coincidence.
S05E18,ALEC,And you'll send me a postcard.
S05E18,AARON,Helen really seemed to respond to Renoir. I think she really connected to the way he painted children.
S05E18,ELAINE,Mm hmm.
S05E18,AARON,"And that Morty, I'll tell ya that guy is full of life. (laughs) He was convinced Monet was near sighted. I kept telling him"
S05E18,ELAINE,Aaron
S05E18,AARON,Yes?
S05E18,ELAINE,"Uh, let me ask you a question. How come you asked Mr. and Mrs. Seinfeld to go to the museum with you?"
S05E18,AARON,"Well, they were in from out of town, I thought they would enjoy it."
S05E18,ELAINE,"Uhuh, um you didn't feel uncomfortable spending the whole day at the museum with two complete strangers who were more than twice your age?"
S05E18,AARON,"No, it was fun."
S05E18,ELAINE,You had fun with Mr. and Mrs. Seinfeld.
S05E18,AARON,"Yea, they bought me a coke."
S05E18,KRAMER,So how'd you come up with the idea for the belt-less trench coat?
S05E18,MORTY,"I came home one night, and I tripped over one of Jerry's toys. (Jerry smiling points to himself and nods with cards in his hands) So I took out my belt just to threaten him, and I got a glimpse of myself in the mirror."
S05E18,KRAMER,How serendipitous.
S05E18,MORTY,So that night I cut off the loops and the Executive was born.
S05E18,KRAMER,Mmm
S05E18,JERRY,He also came up with an idea for a brimless rain-hat but that never materialized. (to Morty) Alright come on let's play.
S05E18,KRAMER,Did you call Jack Klompus yet?
S05E18,MORTY,I haven't been able to reach him. Hey I'll call him right now.
S05E18,JERRY,Ah come on.
S05E18,MORTY,Just a second. (Goes to grab the phone)
S05E18,HELEN,Jerry have you seen Schindler's List?
S05E18,JERRY,No I haven't seen it yet.
S05E18,HELEN,Oh you have to go you have to
S05E18,JERRY,I'm going
S05E18,HELEN,You have to
S05E18,JERRY,Ok
S05E18,MORTY,(on the phone) Hello Jack.
S05E18,JACK,Ya
S05E18,MORTY,It's Morty
S05E18,JACK,Who died?
S05E18,MORTY,Know body died. Jack I want you to do me a big favor. (Jerry holding up some cards looking at his father) In my garage there are a couple of boxes.
S05E18,JACK,What boxes?
S05E18,MORTY,I'm gonna explain what boxes.
S05E18,JACK,Alright how the hell do I know?
S05E18,MORTY,"Anyway there are these three big boxes, you can't miss them. I want you to ship them here to New York for me."
S05E18,JACK,I thought you're going to Paris
S05E18,MORTY,I'm still going to Paris. I got a big deal cooking here.
S05E18,JACK,What's in the boxes?
S05E18,MORTY,Raincoats.
S05E18,JACK,Raincoats? (Doris sighs) You think you're gonna sell those old crappy raincoats? That's garbage.
S05E18,HELEN,I guarantee you Doris is not letting him mail those boxes.
S05E18,JACK,When do you want these?
S05E18,MORTY,Send them tomorrow.
S05E18,ESTELLE,You think they're coming tonight?
S05E18,GEORGE,I dunno they said maybe.
S05E18,FRANK,"Of course they're coming, they're leaving soon. If they don't come tonight they might not see us."
S05E18,ESTELLE,"Well they better come, I got all this Paella."
S05E18,FRANK,"I admire Morty and Helen going to France. We should take a trip, maybe a cruise."
S05E18,GEORGE,"Yes a cruise, a long cruise, just the two of you."
S05E18,ESTELLE,Georgie what were you doing poking around the attic last night?
S05E18,GEORGE,I-I wasn't in the attic.
S05E18,ESTELLE,I heard noise.
S05E18,GEORGE,Maybe it was a mouse.
S05E18,FRANK,(jumping to his feet) OK that's it! We're moving!
S05E18,GEORGE,What?
S05E18,FRANK,I will not tolerate infestation.
S05E18,GEORGE,You haven't even seen one.
S05E18,FRANK,"Don't you understand the very thought, the very idea, I'll never be comfortable again."
S05E18,ESTELLE,Alright Frank that's enough.
S05E18,GEORGE,I guess I've been hanging on to them for so long cuz i couldn't accept the fact that Dad was really gone forever (hugs a piece of clothing)
S05E18,RUDY,Uh huh.
S05E18,GEORGE,They will get a good home won't they?
S05E18,RUDY,Look I gotta be honest with you there's nothing here too spectacular.
S05E18,GEORGE,"Oh I beg to differ. My father took great pride in his appearance, he was a very handsome man, a casanova really."
S05E18,RUDY,I'll give you uh two-hundred dollars for the three boxes.
S05E18,GEORGE,Could you make it two-twenty-five that was his hi-game in bowling.
S05E18,RUDY,Yea I'm in a good mood here.
S05E18,GEORGE,Thank you.
S05E18,KRAMER,"Hey, George what are you doing here?"
S05E18,GEORGE,"Uh, I'm just selling some of Dad's things, (looking into Kramer's eyes) that's what he would have wanted."
S05E18,KRAMER,"Oh, I gotcha (clicks)"
S05E18,GEORGE,(leaving) That'll do.
S05E18,KRAMER,"Oh hey guess what. Morty Seinfeld and I are going into business together, selling raincoats."
S05E18,GEORGE,Hey that's swell.
S05E18,KRAMER,Yea we worked it out all over dinner last night.
S05E18,GEORGE,Dinner? (grabs Kramer)
S05E18,KRAMER,Ya.
S05E18,GEORGE,You had dinner with the Seinfelds'?
S05E18,KRAMER,"Yea, last night."
S05E18,GEORGE,Was this something you had planned for a while?
S05E18,KRAMER,No it was a spur of the moment. Well you know Morty likes to fly by the seat of his vintage pants.
S05E18,GEORGE,"(hurriedly leaves Rudy's) They had plans, They had plans!"
S05E18,KRAMER,"Oooo, boy I've never seen these before (looking at the clothes George just sold Rudy)"
S05E18,RUDY,"Well they just came in, part of my spring-time cruise collection. Two for twenty-five dollars."
S05E18,KRAMER,Oh I'll take these.
S05E18,RUDY,Alright
S05E18,KRAMER,"Hey, remember this raincoat that you sold me?"
S05E18,RUDY,Sure that's the Executive.
S05E18,KRAMER,"Ya, you have any others?"
S05E18,RUDY,"I wish, they don't make 'em anymore."
S05E18,KRAMER,"Suppose I told you I had fifty in mint condition, would you be interested?"
S05E18,RUDY,Very interested
S05E18,KRAMER,Cuz they're coming in from Florida as we speak.
S05E18,RUDY,Well bring 'em in.
S05E18,KRAMER,So you'll buy them?
S05E18,RUDY,I don't see what would possibly stop me.
S05E18,GEORGE,Aaaa (looking around for Jerry) aaaa (finds Jerry) Ah ha. They had plans huh? They were busy. They were busy with their (doing a little dance to make the plans seem all that important) big plans!
S05E18,JERRY,What are you talking about?
S05E18,GEORGE,Mom and Pop Seinfeld
S05E18,JERRY,Look I don't know.
S05E18,GEORGE,"Alright I happen to know what they did last night, they had dinner with Kramer."
S05E18,JERRY,Oh they were tired it was a last minute thing.
S05E18,GEORGE,So what's the deal they don't want to have dinner with my parents?
S05E18,JERRY,That's right.
S05E18,GEORGE,Is there something wrong with my parents?
S05E18,JERRY,Absolutely
S05E18,GEORGE,Because my parents happen to be two pretty wonderful people.
S05E18,JERRY,These the people you currently live with?
S05E18,GEORGE,Yes.
S05E18,JERRY,Uh huh
S05E18,GEORGE,So are they coming tonight or not?
S05E18,JERRY,Look I really don't know what they're plans are.
S05E18,GEORGE,"Ok, fine. It's going to be very interesting, very interesting if they don't show up tonight. You know my mother made all this Paella."
S05E18,JERRY,What is that anyway?
S05E18,GEORGE,"It's a spanish dish. It's a moulage of fish, an meat with rice. Very tasty."
S05E18,JERRY,I-I'll tell 'em
S05E18,GEORGE,Hey could you do one other thing for me?
S05E18,JERRY,Name it.
S05E18,GEORGE,You think your parents would have any objections to taking a little kid to Paris with them? (Jerry looks at him confused) It turns out that the kid's father lives in Paris. (chuckling) Is that a coincidence? (Jerry smilies) Eh you know Alec wants me to take him over there so I figure as long as they're going (claps)
S05E18,JERRY,"So you thought as long as they're mailing postcards, it wouldn't be too much to ask my parents to drag a child who they've never seen, through the streets of Paris?"
S05E18,GEORGE,(pause) Alright if you think it's too much they don't have to mail the postcards.
S05E18,JOANNE,So where's he taking you?
S05E18,ELAINE,"Well first we're going to a matine, I'm taking the afternoon off, we're gonna go see ""My Fair Lady"" and they we are gonna go to dinner. He knows all these fantastic places."
S05E18,JOANNE,You are one lucky girl. (Elaine laughs in happiness) Wish I could find a nice guy. (Joanne goes to leave; Aaron enters) Hi Aaron.
S05E18,AARON,(getting up in Aaron's face) Hey Joanne. (turns to Elaine and goes over to her) Hey
S05E18,ELAINE,(already out from behind her desk goes to Aaron) Hi
S05E18,HELEN,"Hello, Hello."
S05E18,MORTY,Hello Elaine
S05E18,AARON,"I was able to finagle two more tickets to ""My Fair Lady"" and I thought why not ask Morty and Helen."
S05E18,ELAINE,"Oh, Great."
S05E18,MORTY,(looking around) This is some office. What's the square footage?
S05E18,HELEN,You don't mind to you Elaine?
S05E18,ELAINE,Mind? Oh o-of course not.
S05E18,AARON,We can make a whole day of it.
S05E18,MORTY,"This is some building, Harry Fleming used to have an office here. There was a deli on the first floor. You don't get corned beef like that anymore. What happened to that deli?"
S05E18,ELAINE,(somewhat annoyed) I really don't know Mr. Seinfeld
S05E18,JERRY,(stopping them) We better not. (they make out some more; then stop) T-They're gonna be here any second.
S05E18,RACHEL,When are they leaving?
S05E18,JERRY,In two days.
S05E18,RACHEL,It's been soo long.
S05E18,JERRY,I know.
S05E18,RACHEL,"Ok, it's only two more days."
S05E18,JERRY,"Right, Thursday three o'clock."
S05E18,MORTY,(from outside the door; singing) I could have danced all night (entering with Helen) I could have danced all night and still have
S05E18,HELEN,Ooh.
S05E18,JERRY,Oh Hi.
S05E18,HELEN,We didn't know you had company.
S05E18,JERRY,(tucking in his shirt) Oh ya this is Rachel.

S05E18,JERRY,You don't have a car.
S05E18,MORTY,We'll take a bus.
S05E18,JERRY,Come on stop.
S05E18,HELEN,No we don't mind
S05E18,MORTY,I'll get a book.
S05E18,RACHEL,"No no it's ok, I was just leaving anyway."
S05E18,HELEN,O-oh are you sure?
S05E18,RACHEL,Yea.
S05E18,HELEN,Cuz we don't wann..
S05E18,JERRY,(interrupting) No no it's ok. (walking Rachel out) So we'll go see Schindler's List later right?
S05E18,RACHEL,Definitely

S05E18,MORTY,"""My Fair Lady"""
S05E18,JERRY,When did you get tickets to see that?
S05E18,HELEN,"Aaron surprised us, and Elaine came."
S05E18,JERRY,Oh (laughing) Elaine really? Well that sounds interesting.
S05E18,MORTY,We saw Regis Philbin get out of a limousine.
S05E18,JERRY,Oh.
S05E18,HELEN,He looks better on TV.
S05E18,JERRY,Oh
S05E18,JERRY,(answering phone) Hello?
S05E18,JACK,"Hello Jerry,"

S05E18,JACK,There is something wrong with the key. The key doesn't work
S05E18,MORTY,You gotta jiggle it a little bit. I jiggled it. I jiggled it for fifteen minutes.
S05E18,DORIS,Tell him to come down here and get his own packages. You have nothing better to do then worry about his boxes.
S05E18,MORTY,You gotta pull on the knob as you turn it.
S05E18,JACK,Get the hell outta here with your knob.
S05E18,DORIS,What does he want from you?
S05E18,MORTY,My idiot son could open that garage door.
S05E18,JERRY,What did I do?
S05E18,MORTY,Just do it first thing tomorrow. I need it.
S05E18,MORTY,They'll be here first thing Thursday morning.

S05E18,FRANK,"First Kramer, then Elaine?"
S05E18,GEORGE,Yea
S05E18,FRANK,It's a slap in the face.
S05E18,ESTELLE,(with her arms out in wonder) What did we ever do to them? (George puts his arms out and imitates Estelle as she moves her arms up and down as she speaks) I want to know what we did them!
S05E18,FRANK,"What are they too good for us? A raincoat salesman, I could buy and sell 'em like that."
S05E18,ESTELLE,The hell with them.
S05E18,GEORGE,"(in the threshold between the living room and the kitchen) The thing that bothers me the most, is the lying."
S05E18,FRANK,Let's forget about it. We're going on a beautiful vacation. (sits down in his chair)
S05E18,GEORGE,(sitting down) Vacation?
S05E18,FRANK,You're mother and I are planning on taking a cruise.
S05E18,GEORGE,(claps all happy) AH! (half hugs Estelle)
S05E18,FRANK,But I can't find any vacation clothes. They were in the attic.
S05E18,GEORGE,The attic? Y-you haven't wore any of those clothes for years.
S05E18,FRANK,"How can I go on a cruise with out my cabana wear? I love those, those clothes. (Looks down yells) AH! (jumps out of his chair) A mouse! I saw a mouse! (takes off into another room with glass doors on it and shuts the door)"
S05E18,GEORGE,(picking up what Frank saw as a mouse) It's the remote.
S05E18,FRANK,(looking from the room; you can see him through the glass) Where the hell are my clothes? I love those clothes.
S05E18,RUDY,Lousy moth ridden crap.
S05E18,[Movie Theater,Schindler's List]
S05E18,JERRY,Hey.
S05E18,MORTY,"Hey, Jerry."
S05E18,HELEN,So how was the movie?
S05E18,JERRY,"Oh, really good, really good."
S05E18,HELEN,And didn't the three hours go by just like that (snaps her fingers)
S05E18,JERRY,Like that (snaps his fingers)
S05E18,MORTY,"What about the end, with the list?"
S05E18,JERRY,Ya that was some list.
S05E18,HELEN,What did you think about the black and white?
S05E18,JERRY,(confused) The black and white.
S05E18,MORTY,The whole movie was in black and white.
S05E18,JERRY,"Oh yea, I didn't even realize."
S05E18,MORTY,"You don't even think about it, there's so much going on."
S05E18,JERRY,"Ya ya, I tell ya I could see it again."
S05E18,KRAMER,"So Klompus has the key, but the jerk couldn't open it up. All you gotta do it jiggle it (has is hand out jiggling) jus get it in there (jiggling making a bunch of noises) jigg jigg jiggle reiggle"
S05E18,RUDY,"Look, I find this whole thing very uninteresting. When you get the coats come in."
S05E18,KRAMER,Hey what again?
S05E18,GEORGE,I'm trying to buy some of the clothes back. (realizing something) Hey you wanna come over for dinner tonight? My mother made all this extra Paella.
S05E18,KRAMER,"Paella, ya I'll be there."
S05E18,GEORGE,Apparently the Seinfelds' are too good for us. I shouldn't say anything bad about your uh your partner.
S05E18,KRAMER,No no you know we're not partners. I only get twenty-five percent.
S05E18,GEORGE,Twenty-five percent? It was your idea.
S05E18,KRAMER,Yap I know.
S05E18,GEORGE,You're doing all the leg work.
S05E18,KRAMER,That's right
S05E18,GEORGE,He's ripping you off
S05E18,KRAMER,You're right he's ripping me off
S05E18,GEORGE,If anybody should be getting more it's you.
S05E18,KRAMER,He's ripping me off
S05E18,GEORGE,Well don't let him take advantage of you like that.
S05E18,KRAMER,YAH! (exits)
S05E18,RUDY,(coming out of the back-room noticing George) Oh it's you? You're the one who sold me the moth ridden cabana crap.
S05E18,MORTY,"You know I've been thinking, why is Kramer getting twenty-five percent?"
S05E18,HELEN,Well he told you about the place.
S05E18,MORTY,"So what, why is that worth twenty-five percent? It's a finders fee. You know what a finders fee is?"
S05E18,HELEN,You find something you get a fee.
S05E18,MORTY,Finder's fee is ten percent and no more.
S05E18,HELEN,Well it's too late now.
S05E18,MORTY,"Those are my coats. I saved them, I stored them, I've been waiting years for this pay off."
S05E18,HELEN,Well you're not gonna say anything.
S05E18,KRAMER,I've been thinking about something.
S05E18,MORTY,Ya so have I
S05E18,KRAMER,Ahh! I don't think the deal is fair.
S05E18,MORTY,You don't think it's fair.
S05E18,KRAMER,"No no, I found the place, I set the whole thing up, I'm doing all the leg work."
S05E18,MORTY,What leg work?
S05E18,KRAMER,"Oh, there's leg work."
S05E18,MORTY,If anything you're getting too much.
S05E18,KRAMER,Too much?!
S05E18,MORTY,"That's right, they're my coats."
S05E18,KRAMER,Look I want thirty-five percent.
S05E18,MORTY,I'm thinking more like fifteen.
S05E18,KRAMER,No way I'm taking fifteen.
S05E18,MORTY,Well you're not getting thirty-five.
S05E18,KRAMER,Alright let's compromise. Twenty-five percent.
S05E18,MORTY,Ok it's a deal
S05E18,RUDY,"Moths are a discourage to my business, all it takes is one moth to lay eggs. You know what happens to the larvae? They hatch and they're everywhere."
S05E18,GEORGE,"I'm sorry, umm he-here's your money back (gives Rudy the money back) I-I-I'll have the clothes."
S05E18,RUDY,(counting the money to make sure it's all there) It's already put a dent in my fumigation bill.
S05E18,GEORGE,So uh where are the clothes?
S05E18,RUDY,I burned 'em.
S05E18,GEORGE,Oh. That's good.
S05E18,ELAINE,"N-I know they're your parents Jerry an' they're very nice people. But don't you think it's odd, that a thirty-five year old man is going to these lengths to see that someone else's parents are enjoying themselves? I mean don't you find that abnormal?"
S05E18,JERRY,It is a tad askew.
S05E18,ELAINE,I mean they're your parents and you don't do anything. So why is this stranger doing it?
S05E18,JERRY,I've hardly been out to dinner with them.
S05E18,ELAINE,"See, See, I can't even say anything you know because all he's really doing is being nice but but know body is this nice, this is like certifiably nice."
S05E18,JERRY,You're right he's insane.
S05E18,ELAINE,"Yes, he's insane, that's what I think."
S05E18,JERRY,So what are you going to do?
S05E18,ELAINE,"I don't know, I don't know what to do. (sighs) Oh god.... so how was the movie?"
S05E18,JERRY,Uh from what I saw it was pretty good.
S05E18,ELAINE,Ya what do you mean from what you saw?
S05E18,JERRY,Well I um I didn't ah actually get to see the whole movie.
S05E18,ELAINE,Yea why not?
S05E18,JERRY,I was kind of um (pauses) making out.
S05E18,ELAINE,"(thinks for a second) You were making, out during Schindler's List?"
S05E18,JERRY,"I couldn't help it. We hadn't been alone in a long time, it just got the better of me."
S05E18,ELAINE,During Schindler's List?
S05E18,JERRY,(trying to justify it) We're both living with our parents.
S05E18,ELAINE,Did anybody see you? Did anyone say anything?
S05E18,JERRY,No I don't think so. I saw Newman as I was leaving but see me.
S05E18,ELAINE,Oh.
S05E18,NEWMAN,Hello Mrs. Seinfeld
S05E18,HELEN,"(like Jerry) Hello, Newman. Jerry's not here. (goes to shut the door on him)"
S05E18,NEWMAN,"Uh ah (stops her from closing the door; walks in) Having a nice trip? (walks over, grabs a junior mint, smells it then puts it in his pocket)"
S05E18,HELEN,"Wonderful, we went to the theater last night."
S05E18,NEWMAN,Oh the theater. Because I was wondering.
S05E18,HELEN,Wondering what?
S05E18,NEWMAN,Why I didn't see you at Schindler's List with Jerry.
S05E18,HELEN,Well we already saw it.
S05E18,NEWMAN,"Oh, well it's a good thing for Jerry that you didn't go."
S05E18,MORTY,(getting up from the table and coming over) Why is that?
S05E18,NEWMAN,Well he really seemed to have his hands full if you know what I mean.
S05E18,HELEN,I'm afraid I don't.
S05E18,NEWMAN,Him and his little buxom friend Rachel were going at it pretty good in the balcony.
S05E18,MORTY,What?
S05E18,NEWMAN,"What, do I have to spell it out for ya? He was moving on her like the storm-troopers into Poland."
S05E18,HELEN,Jerry was necking during Schindler's List?
S05E18,NEWMAN,Yes! A more offensive spectacle I cannot recall. Anyway I just really came up to get some detergent.
S05E18,HELEN,Jerry sends his laundry out.
S05E18,NEWMAN,(laughing) Oh ho right. Well very nice seeing you folks and a by the way you didn't hear this from me. Tata (runs down the hallway laughing)
S05E18,JERRY,Hi (takes off his coat and puts it on the counter at which point his parents are both right by him as he goes into the refrigerator. He grabs a drink then turns around to see his parents right there) What? What did I do?
S05E18,HELEN,How could you?
S05E18,JERRY,How could I what?
S05E18,HELEN,You were making out during Schindler's List?
S05E18,JERRY,What? No.
S05E18,MORTY,Don't lie Jerry.
S05E18,JERRY,(turns) Newman.
S05E18,HELEN,How could you do such a thing?
S05E18,JERRY,"I couldn't help it. We hadn't been alone together in a long time and we just kinda started up a little during the coming attractions and the next thing we knew, the war was over."
S05E18,JERRY,(answering the phone) Hello.
S05E18,JACK,"Hello Jerry, it's Jack Klompus."
S05E18,JERRY,Hang on a second. (handing Morty the phone) Dad it's Klompus.
S05E18,MORTY,Hello
S05E18,JACK,"Hello Morty, listen that key doesn't work. It's no good."
S05E18,MORTY,You didn't get in?
S05E18,JACK,"Oh I got in, I had to break the window with a rock and then I got my hand all cut up reaching in."
S05E18,MORTY,You broke the window?
S05E18,HELEN,He broke the window?
S05E18,JACK,You wanted those damn boxes didn't you?
S05E18,DORIS,(off camera) He should be on his hands and knees thanking you.
S05E18,MORTY,Did you send them?
S05E18,JACK,"Yea, they'll be there tomorrow afternoon, two o'clock."
S05E18,MORTY,Tomorrow afternoon?
S05E18,HELEN,Tomorrow afternoon?
S05E18,JERRY,Tomorrow afternoon?
S05E18,MORTY,I told you to send them express.
S05E18,JACK,"W-well it was ten dollars cheaper in the afternoon than the morning, I figured what the hell's the difference."
S05E18,MORTY,So what did you do about the window?
S05E18,JACK,I gotta fix your window now?
S05E18,MORTY,"Alright alright, goodbye. (Morty hangs up the phone, Jack hangs up the phone) I don't think we are gonna make that flight."
S05E18,JERRY,W-what do you mean you're not making the flight?
S05E18,HELEN,"We have to make the flight, we're with a charter group. If we don't the trip is off."
S05E18,MORTY,Well what's the difference we'll go some place else.
S05E18,HELEN,Some place else? What about Paris?
S05E18,MORTY,"You don't understand, I've come this far, I can't stop now."
S05E18,HELEN,I can't believe that you're doing all this just to sell some stupid raincoats.
S05E18,MORTY,You don't understand fashion is cyclical this thing could come back.
S05E18,HELEN,I think you're out of your mind.
S05E18,FRANK,I just don't understand how all those clothes can disappear.
S05E18,GEORGE,Moths?
S05E18,FRANK,"Moths, ate three boxes?"
S05E18,GEORGE,"Well you know what happens with larvae hatch, they-they're everywhere."
S05E18,ESTELLE,"You know, I was thinking today. I never liked those Seinfelds anyway, he's an idiot all together. (Knocking at the door) Ah there's Kramer."
S05E18,KRAMER,(from outside) Hello?
S05E18,ESTELLE,Hello
S05E18,KRAMER,"(still outside) Helowwwowwow (Estelle opens the door) Hey (kisses Estelle hello) Ha ha, Good evening (George waves)"
S05E18,ESTELLE,Hope you're hungry. (goes into the kitchen)
S05E18,KRAMER,Ooo Paella
S05E18,GEORGE,Hey uh let me take you're coat.
S05E18,KRAMER,(giving George his coat) Oh ya thanks buddy.
S05E18,FRANK,"That shirt, where'd you get that shirt?"
S05E18,KRAMER,Wha?
S05E18,FRANK,"That's my cabana shirt, you stole my shirt you son of a bitch! (really fast) George you let your friends go up in my attic and steal my clothes? (grabbing at the shirt) Gimme that back"
S05E18,KRAMER,(trying to get away) woah
S05E18,GEORGE,Dad?!
S05E18,KRAMER,(laughs as Frank ends up tickling him; gets away) I bought it from Rudy.
S05E18,GEORGE,"Rudy?! That skunk, I knew he didn't burn those clothes."
S05E18,FRANK,Who's Rudy? What clothes?
S05E18,GEORGE,I sold your clothes yesterday.
S05E18,FRANK,You sold my clothes (smacks George on the forehead) what do you mean you sold my clothes?
S05E18,GEORGE,I didn't think you wore them anymore.
S05E18,FRANK,It's cruise wear!
S05E18,ESTELLE,"Kramer, I love that shirt."
S05E18,KRAMER,Yaya
S05E18,FRANK,THAT'S BECAUSE IT'S MINE!!
S05E18,ESTELLE,"You look just like Frank, on our honeymoon."
S05E18,KRAMER,"Oh, well, thank you."
S05E18,FRANK,Who's this Rudy?
S05E18,KRAMER,Well Rudy's the guy buying Morty's raincoats.
S05E18,FRANK,Morty Seinfeld? He's a bum.
S05E18,KRAMER,"Well, the whole deal going down tomorrow. Morty's gonna miss his plane for it."
S05E18,GEORGE,Missing his plane? Wasn't that a charter flight?
S05E18,KRAMER,Yea.
S05E18,GEORGE,What happens to charter tickets when you don't use em?
S05E18,KRAMER,Well I suppose they are wasted.
S05E18,GEORGE,Yes I suppose they are.
S05E18,FRANK,Tomorrow I'm going straight down to this Rudy and get my clothes.
S05E18,KRAMER,A mouse!
S05E18,JERRY,You want the tickets?
S05E18,GEORGE,Yes.
S05E18,JERRY,You're gonna take this kid to Paris?
S05E18,GEORGE,"Hey I get a free trip to Paris, I go in the Big Brother's Hall-of-Fame, I mail my own postcards."
S05E18,JERRY,You know I'm paying for these tickets.
S05E18,GEORGE,"It's alright, I got lunch."
S05E18,KRAMER,"Oh, you should have gone to the Costanzas' for dinner. Mmm the Paella was magnificent. Have you ever had really good Paella?"
S05E18,MORTY,Not really.
S05E18,KRAMER,"Oh it's a orgiastic feast for the senses. The want and the festival, the sites, sounds, and colors an mmmummumm mumm"
S05E18,JERRY,Hey Dad are you sure we are at the right carousel?
S05E18,MORTY,This is it.
S05E18,KRAMER,So how much are we gonna make?
S05E18,MORTY,"Take it easy, I've been through a million of these negotiations."
S05E18,KRAMER,Wha two thousand? Three thousand?
S05E18,MORTY,That's giving it away. This is a one of a kind item.
S05E18,KRAMER,More? More than three thousand?
S05E18,MORTY,Just watch me do my thing.
S05E18,JERRY,"Say Dad, (pointing at a raincoat sitting on the carousel next to an open box) isn't that one of yours?"
S05E18,MORTY,"Look at this. Look at how this idiot packed it. He didn't tape it, he just flipped the flaps. (Kramer, Morty and Jerry are looking around grabbing raincoats which are scattered all over the place.) Kramer you missed a couple."
S05E18,WOMAN,"Bon-jour, welcome to the Gateway to Paris Charter Flight."
S05E18,JERRY,(turns around noticing the Charter flight) Dad isn't that your charter group?
S05E18,GEORGE,"Honesty, hard-work, these are the values that I was raised on. The most important thing Joey, is to be able to look yourself in the mirror before you go to sleep at night."
S05E18,JOEY,"Hey! I got news for you four eyes, there's no way you're staying with us in Paris."
S05E18,FRANK,You burned them? Those clothes are not yours to burn.
S05E18,RUDY,Who are you anyways?
S05E18,FRANK,I'm the father.
S05E18,RUDY,He said his father was dead.
S05E18,FRANK,He said I was dead?
S05E18,RUDY,That's right. Squeezed an extra twenty-five dollars out of me.
S05E18,FRANK,That's what my life is worth to him? Twenty-five dollars.
S05E18,KRAMER,"Hey, Frank!"
S05E18,FRANK,"Oh, I just want to you know I'm retracting our dinner invitation."
S05E18,MORTY,Well you don't have to retract it because we never went.
S05E18,FRANK,I'm retracting that it was ever offered.
S05E18,MORTY,I retract your retraction.
S05E18,FRANK,"Oh, you trying to unload some of that junk of yours?"
S05E18,MORTY,"Would you excuse me please, we're conducting business here."
S05E18,RUDY,You can keep your raincoats. I'm not interested.
S05E18,KRAMER,I thought we had a deal?
S05E18,FRANK,That's another one of my shirts!!
S05E18,RUDY,I'm not buying anymore clothes from anyone off the street.
S05E18,MORTY,Who's off the street? I'm in the raincoat business for thirty-five years.
S05E18,RUDY,Ya how do I know there aren't moths like his stuff?
S05E18,FRANK,My clothes don't have moths!
S05E18,MORTY,Because of his moths you're not buying my raincoats?
S05E18,RUDY,That's right.
S05E18,KRAMER,(laughing) I'm all ticklish. (a moth flies out of his shirt; they all look at it)
S05E18,ANNOUNCEMENT,"Flight-433 now boarding for Miami, Gate 18a. Flight-433 now boarding."
S05E18,MORTY,"Ok, let's go."
S05E18,HELEN,(to Aaron) It was so nice of you to come to the airport to see us off.
S05E18,AARON,Are you sure you can't stay a little longer?
S05E18,ELAINE & JERRY,NO.
S05E18,MORTY,"Ah, good-bye."
S05E18,ELAINE,Good-bye
S05E18,JERRY,Take care
S05E18,MORTY,Alright Jer.
S05E18,ELAINE,Nice to see..
S05E18,MORTY,Buh bye Elaine
S05E18,JERRY,Buh bye.
S05E18,HELEN,Buh bye.
S05E18,HELEN,(looking at Jerry while being overly hugged by Aaron) We'll call you when we get home.
S05E18,AARON,Thank you.
S05E18,JERRY,"I think she meant me, but."
S05E18,MORTY,Make sure Kramer uses good tape when he sends back the raincoats.
S05E18,JERRY,Ok.
S05E18,ELAINE,Bye.
S05E18,JERRY,Bye.
S05E18,ELAINE,Aaron? Aaron are you ok?
S05E18,AARON,I could've done more. I could've done so much more.
S05E18,ELAINE,You did enough.
S05E18,AARON,"(turning toward her) No, I could've called the travel agency, got them on another flight to Paris, I coulda got them out."
S05E18,JERRY,"You tried Aaron, it was too expensive."
S05E18,AARON,"(holds his arm up) This watch, this watch could've paid for their whole trip. (holds his other hand up) This ring, this ring is one more dinner I could've taken them out to. (Jerry and Elaine look at each other like he's crazy) Water, they need some water (turns around and runs to the Flight Agent)"
S05E18,ELAINE,Why?
S05E18,AARON,(to the Flight Agent) They'll get dehydrated on the plane! Get the Seinfelds some water. Please! Please!
S05E18,JERRY,Hi Mr. Goldstein is Rachel home?
S05E18,MR. GOLDSTEIN,"I'm afraid Rachel's not going to be able to see you tonight, or any other night for that matter."
S05E18,JERRY,Why what did I do?
S05E18,MR. GOLDSTEIN,"(Rachel is know seen behind her Dad) You know very well. I heard about your behavior at the movies the other night it was disgraceful. You should be ashamed of yourself, I for one will not allow my daughter to be involved with someone of such weak moral fiber. Fortunately my postman happened to have witnessed the entire incident. A heavy set fellow, I believe he lives in your building. (Jerry turns to almost do a 'Newman') Now if you don't mind. (starts to close the door)"
S05E18,JERRY,Rachel!
S05E18,MR. GOLDSTEIN,(closing the door on Jerry) Good night!
S05E18,JERRY,Rachel!
S05E18,JERRY,"So my parents get home, they open the door, my father flicks the light on, the whole place is cleaned out, everything."
S05E18,ELAINE,"Aahh, (pushes Jerry from her seat at the table) Get Out! How did it happen?"
S05E18,JERRY,"The broken window, Klompus never fixed it. They just walked right in."
S05E18,ELAINE,"Oohh, boy. They could use a vacation."
S05E18,JERRY,"Yea they're taking one, the travel agent is trying to set something else up for them."
S05E18,ELAINE,(sighs) So how about that Aaron?
S05E18,JERRY,Whew
S05E18,ELAINE,You know what drove me crazy about him? Did you ever notice that he stood too close to you when he talked?
S05E18,JERRY,No I hadn't noticed.
S05E18,NEWMAN,(at the counter) Pair of bear claws please.
S05E18,JERRY,(hearing Newman turns and sees him) Hiya Newman.
S05E18,NEWMAN,(moving away from the counter getting closer to the door) Hello Jerry.
S05E18,JERRY,"Say, I happened to catch you coming out of Schindler's List the other night."
S05E18,NEWMAN,"Ohh, were you there?"
S05E18,JERRY,Yes I was.
S05E18,NEWMAN,(looking scared) I-it's a it's a...powerful film.
S05E18,JERRY,"Yes, shocking brutality don't you think?"
S05E18,NEWMAN,(couple quick breaths) Shocking.
S05E18,JERRY,"Yes, well that was nothing."
S05E18,NEWMAN,(running out the door) Jerry! Jerry!
S05E18,GEORGE,Where the hell is your father?!
S05E18,ESTELLE,This is the best thing we ever did.
S05E18,FRANK,I just hope those exterminators know what they're doing.
S05E18,ESTELLE,Ah forget about them let's just...
S05E20,TOBY (exuberantly),"These are great! Just great! Really great! Really, really great! Don't you think so, Elaine?"
S05E20,ELAINE (put off by Toby's exuberance),"Yeah, really great."
S05E20,TOBY,"Oh, a coffee table book about coffee tables! (To Kramer) How did you come up with this idea?"
S05E20,KRAMER,It was there!
S05E20,TOBY,"Oh, look at this one! It's saying, 'I'm a coffee table, put some coffee on me! Oh, the hotter the better, that's what I'm here for!' (laughs)"
S05E20,ELAINE,"You know actually, I've got some work I gotta do, so..."
S05E20,KRAMER,"Hey, how about if the book came with these little fold-out legs...so the book itself becomes a coffee table?"
S05E20,TOBY,"Ohhh, that is a great idea! Really, really great!"
S05E20,ELAINE (imitating Toby),"'Oooh, and that coffee table is saying, put some coffee on me!' I'd like to put some coffee on her. Hot, scalding coffee - right in her face! I swear! This is like working with a contestant from ""The Price Is Right""! (demonstrates a winner on ""The Price Is Right"")"
S05E20,JERRY,"Yeah, that's real interesting. Elaine, listen, tell me if you think this is funny - (reads comedy he's written) ""Men definitely hit the remote more than women...men don't care what's on TV, men only care what else is on TV. Women want to see what the show is before they change the channel, because men hunt and women nest."""
S05E20,ELAINE (uninterested),"Yeah, it's funny, I dunno."
S05E20,JERRY,"You don't know? Come on, that's gold!"
S05E20,ELAINE,"Well, I don't know about ""gold."""
S05E20,JERRY,"Oh, that's gold, baby."
S05E20,ELAINE,"'Baby'? What, are you doing George now?"
S05E20,JERRY,I was saying 'baby' way before George!
S05E20,ELAINE,"Well, I don't know, don't ask me any more questions about jokes, Jerry, it just puts too much pressure on me."
S05E20,JERRY,"Well, this guy Leonard Christian's gonna be there tomorrow night."
S05E20,ELAINE,"Yeah, who's he?"
S05E20,JERRY,He's a writer from Entertainment Weekly . I would like to have a good show.
S05E20,KRAMER,"Danke schoen, my little dumplings."
S05E20,ELAINE,Hi.
S05E20,KRAMER (to Elaine),"Hey, how about that Toby, huh?"
S05E20,ELAINE,"Yeah, how about her?"
S05E20,KRAMER,"Ooh, she's a package full of energy!"
S05E20,ELAINE,"Yeah, she's a package full of something."
S05E20,KRAMER,"Yeah, and that something is life. Jerry, you gotta meet this gal - she's brimmin' with positivity!"
S05E20,ELAINE (absolutely disgusted),"Oh, pleeeeease. (moves to the living room and sits down)"
S05E20,KRAMER (to Jerry),"Hey, are you performing tomorrow?"
S05E20,JERRY,Yeah.
S05E20,KRAMER,"Great, I'm gonna bring Toby."
S05E20,JERRY,"Well, you better laugh 'cause I'm being reviewed. Leonard Christian's gonna be there."
S05E20,KRAMER,"Oh, she's a great laugher - right, Elaine?"
S05E20,ELAINE,"Oh yeah, she's a great laugher, Jerry. (imitates Toby) Really, really great!"
S05E20,JERRY (to Kramer),"Well, you want to sit with George? I think he's coming with Robin."
S05E20,KRAMER,Is that the waitress from the comedy club?
S05E20,JERRY,Yeah.
S05E20,KRAMER,Oh.
S05E20,ELAINE,"What about her kid, is she bringing him, too?"
S05E20,KRAMER,She's got a kid?
S05E20,JERRY,"Yeah, you should see George get along with this kid!"
S05E20,GEORGE,"Ow! What are you doing under there? Hey, stop that! Don't eat that! That's not food! (to Robin) He's suckin' down Equal packets!"
S05E20,ROBIN,Do you think 25 kids is too much?
S05E20,GEORGE,"25 kids for his birthday party? (to kid under table) Don't put your tongue on the floor! He's putting his tongue on the floor! Here, here, have some more sugar packets. (tosses some Equal packets under the table)"
S05E20,ROBIN,"So, what about entertainment? (to kid) Should I get Barney?"
S05E20,KID,No Barney!
S05E20,ROBIN (to George),Maybe a clown.
S05E20,GEORGE,How about Bozo?
S05E20,KID,Who's Bozo?
S05E20,GEORGE,"Who's Bozo? Bozo the Clown, that's who Bozo is. When I was a kid, Bozo the Clown was the clown, bar none."
S05E20,ROBIN,George...
S05E20,GEORGE,"With the orange hair, and the big clown shirt with the ruffles..."
S05E20,ROBIN,George...
S05E20,GEORGE,He had a TV show! He had cartoons!
S05E20,ROBIN,"George! Forget Bozo, George. Bozo's out. He's finished. It's over for Bozo."
S05E20,GEORGE,"You know, when I was a kid, we didn't have these elaborate birthday parties w-with catered food and entertainment. I remember my 7th birthday party..."
S05E20,FRANK,"Blow out the candles! Blow out the candles, I said! Blow out the damn candles!"
S05E20,ESTELLE,"Stop it, Frank! You're killing him!"
S05E20,FRANK,Blow out the candles!!
S05E20,ROBIN,"Well, this time, you can blow out the candles."
S05E20,GEORGE,"Nah, I have asthma. (Robin's kid grabs George's leg from under the table, and George struggles.)"
S05E20,TOBY,Hi!
S05E20,ELAINE (in a dreadful tone),"Hi, Toby."
S05E20,TOBY,How are you doing today?
S05E20,ELAINE,Fine... (Toby sits and waits for Elaine to speak.) How are you?
S05E20,TOBY,"Oh, I'm great! Just great. Really great! Oh, hey - did you hear about Bob Rosen?"
S05E20,ELAINE,Nope.
S05E20,TOBY,He is going to Knopp. He is going to be a vice president.
S05E20,ELAINE,"Knopp? Really? Boy. That means there's an opening here for senior editor...has Lippman, uh, hired anyone?"
S05E20,TOBY,No. I hear he wants to promote someone in-house.
S05E20,ELAINE,Really!?
S05E20,TOBY,Maybe it'll be you!
S05E20,ELAINE,Oh...well...
S05E20,TOBY,"You really deserve it. I mean, you have experience, seniority...Lippman really respects your opinion..."
S05E20,ELAINE (beaming),"Well! Well, it could be you."
S05E20,TOBY,No...
S05E20,ELAINE,"No, really."
S05E20,TOBY (standing),Really? You think so?
S05E20,ELAINE (humoring her),Sure.
S05E20,TOBY,"Boy, wouldn't that be exciting!"
S05E20,ELAINE,"I mean, stranger things have happened..."
S05E20,TOBY,Wow! Me! A senior editor! (deadly serious) I'd like that.
S05E20,ELAINE,"Well, you shouldn't get your hopes up, Toby."
S05E20,TOBY,"Well, it's a possibility, like you said! Stranger things have happened! Thank you, Elaine. Thank you. (Exits.)"
S05E20,JERRY,"Hey, Ronnie."
S05E20,RONNIE,Hey.
S05E20,JERRY,(To bartender) Can I have a club soda? (To Ronnie) Goin' on tonight?
S05E20,RONNIE,Yeah. You?
S05E20,JERRY,Yeah.
S05E20,RONNIE,You know Leonard Christian's here?
S05E20,JERRY,"Yeah, I know."
S05E20,RONNIE,Can I ask you something? Are my nostrils getting bigger?
S05E20,JERRY,(looking at his nostrils) I don't...think so.
S05E20,RONNIE,Are you sure? Take a good look. They seem a little bigger?
S05E20,JERRY,I don't...I dunno.
S05E20,RONNIE,Is it possible for nostrils to expand?
S05E20,JERRY,"Oh, is this a bit?"
S05E20,RONNIE,"Hey, I don't do ""bits."" I'm a prop comic. Dammit, I can't find my water gun. I can't go on without my water gun."
S05E20,KRAMER,"Hey, Jerry."
S05E20,JERRY,(turns to greet Kramer) Hey.
S05E20,KRAMER,"Well here's Toby, (points to Jerry in order to introduce him to Toby) Jerry."
S05E20,TOBY,"This is so exciting! Look, I have goosebumps! (To Jerry) Touch! Touch them! (Jerry touches her arm. Toby screeches with excitement.) I've never been to a comedy club before!"
S05E20,JERRY,"Really! You know, a lot of restaurants are serving brewed decaf now, too."
S05E20,TOBY (laughing),You are so funny!
S05E20,JERRY,"Oh, you'll have a good time, I swear."
S05E20,TOBY,"Oh! He swears like he thinks I don't believe him. I believe you. I believe you! Oh, he's so funny! (laughs)"
S05E20,KRAMER,What about me?
S05E20,TOBY (serious),"What about you? (laughs) I'm only kidding. You're funny, too. I love to laugh."
S05E20,JERRY,"Good, good."
S05E20,KRAMER (to Jerry),"So, you up next?"
S05E20,JERRY,"Yeah, why don't you guys get a table so you'll have good seats?"
S05E20,TOBY,"Oh yeah, we don't want some jerk sitting in front of us, it'll be like, 'Hey, big head, can you move out of the way? I didn't pay a cover charge to stare at your bald spot.' (laughs)"
S05E20,KRAMER,"Alright, so you have a good show, huh buddy?"
S05E20,JERRY,Yeah.
S05E20,TOBY,"Oh, have a great show. Hey, we'll make sure it's a great show!"
S05E20,JERRY,"O.k., good, I'll see you later. (Kramer and Toby are about to exit. She turns around and clutches Kramer's jacket.)"
S05E20,TOBY,"Oh, he's so great! This is so great! I'm so excited!"
S05E20,JERRY,Men definitely hit the remote button more than women...
S05E20,TOBY (loudly),"Oh, really! Really! That is so true!"
S05E20,JERRY,"Yes, yeah...see, men don't care what's on TV, men only care what else is on TV."
S05E20,TOBY,Yes! Yes! Right on! Right on! (Other audience members give her puzzled looks.)
S05E20,JERRY (attempting to carry on despite Toby's interruptions),See...women really want to see what the show is before they change the channel...
S05E20,TOBY,"Oh, that is so true, yes!"
S05E20,JERRY,...that's why men hunt and women nest.
S05E20,TOBY,BOO! BOO! Hiss! Boo! (Toby's obnoxious behavior causes Jerry to completely lose his place and mess up his act.)
S05E20,JERRY,"Yea, ya, so...anyway what was I talking about."
S05E20,KRAMER,Hey.
S05E20,JERRY,"Hey, what's the deal? What was goin' on there? I invite you down here, I have an important show, and she heckles me?!"
S05E20,KRAMER,"Look, she didn't mean anything."
S05E20,JERRY,"Well, what is the matter with her? Is she crazy?!"
S05E20,KRAMER,"She's just being enthusiastic, that's all!"
S05E20,JERRY,Hey! What is wrong with you?!
S05E20,TOBY,Me? Nothing's wrong with me.
S05E20,JERRY,Y-You boo me?! You hiss?! You didn't stop blathering throughout the whole set!
S05E20,TOBY,"Oh, come on! I thought you're a pro! That's part of the show."
S05E20,JERRY,No! Not part of the show! Booing and hissing are not part of the show! You boo puppets! You hiss villains in silent movies!
S05E20,TOBY,"Well, that's the way I express myself. How are you gonna make it in this business if you can't take it?"
S05E20,JERRY,"Oh, I can take it."
S05E20,TOBY (to Kramer),Let's go. (Ronnie walks by Jerry.)
S05E20,RONNIE,"Hey, man. Good set."
S05E20,GEORGE,Bozo?
S05E20,ERIC,No.
S05E20,GEORGE,B-O-Z-O?
S05E20,ERIC,"Sorry, I..."
S05E20,GEORGE,You've never heard of Bozo the Clown?
S05E20,ERIC,No!
S05E20,GEORGE,How could you not know who Bozo the Clown is?
S05E20,ERIC,"I don't know, I just don't."
S05E20,GEORGE,How can you call yourself a clown and not know who Bozo is?
S05E20,ERIC,"Hey, man - what are you hassling me for? This is just a gig, it's not my life. I don't know who Bozo is, what - is he a clown?"
S05E20,GEORGE,"Is he a clown? What, are you kidding me!?"
S05E20,ERIC,"Well, what is he?"
S05E20,GEORGE,"Yes, he's a clown!"
S05E20,ERIC,"Alright, so what's the big deal! There's millions of clowns!"
S05E20,GEORGE,"Alright, just forget it."
S05E20,ERIC,"Me forget it? You should forget it! You're livin' in the past, man! You're hung up on some clown from the sixties, man!"
S05E20,GEORGE,"Alright, very good, very good...go fold your little balloon animals, Eric. Eric! (chuckles) What kind of name is that for a clown, huh?"
S05E20,ROBIN'S MOTHER,"Excuse me...you must be George! I'm Robin's mother. Oh, you seem like such a lovely young man!"
S05E20,GEORGE,"Well, I do what I can. (Robin comes over.)"
S05E20,ROBIN,"Hi Mom, how's everything?"
S05E20,ROBIN'S MOTHER,"Oh, this is just a wonderful party!"
S05E20,ROBIN,The burgers should be ready in a minute.
S05E20,GEORGE,"Ah, great, great. (sniffs) What's that smell? Smoke? (walks to the kitchen) Hey everybody, I think I smell some smoke back here...(smoke boils into the doorway.) FIRE! FIRE! Get out of the way!"
S05E20,GEORGE (to the EMTs),"It was an inferno in there! An inferno! (Eric, Robin's mother, and all the kids rush at George.)"
S05E20,ERIC,There he is! That's him! (Tries to clobber George with his big shoe.)
S05E20,ROBIN'S MOTHER,That's the coward that left us to die!
S05E20,GEORGE (voice is hoarse from screaming),I...was trying to lead the way. We needed a leader! Someone to lead the way to safety.
S05E20,ROBIN,"But you yelled ""get out of my way""!"
S05E20,GEORGE,"Because! Because, as the leader...if I die...then all hope is lost! Who would lead? The clown? Instead of castigating me, you should all be thanking me. What kind of a topsy-turvy world do we live in, where-where heroes are cast as villains? Brave men as cowards?"
S05E20,ROBIN,"But I saw you push the women and children out of the way in a mad panic! I saw you knock them down! And when you ran out, you left everyone behind!"
S05E20,GEORGE,"Seemingly. Seemingly, to the untrained eye, I can fully understand how you got that impression. What looked like pushing...what looked like knocking down...was a safety precaution! In a fire, you stay close to the ground, am I right? And when I ran out that door, I was not leaving anyone behind! Oh, quite the contrary! I risked my life making sure that exit was clear. Any other questions?"
S05E20,FIREMAN,How do you live with yourself?
S05E20,GEORGE,Its not easy.
S05E20,GEORGE,So she doesn't want to see me anymore.
S05E20,JERRY,"Did you knock her over too, or just the kids?"
S05E20,GEORGE,"No, her too. And her mother."
S05E20,JERRY,Really? Her mother.
S05E20,GEORGE,"Yeah. I may have stepped on her arm, too, I don't know."
S05E20,JERRY,You probably couldn't see because of the smoke.
S05E20,GEORGE,Yeah. But it was somebody's arm.
S05E20,JERRY,"Hmm. So you feel ""women and children first,"" in this day and age, is somewhat of an antiquated notion."
S05E20,GEORGE,To some degree.
S05E20,JERRY,"So basically, it's every man, woman, child, and invalid for themselves."
S05E20,GEORGE,In a manner of speaking.
S05E20,JERRY,"Yeah, well, it's honest."
S05E20,GEORGE,Yeah. She should be commending me for treating everyone like equals.
S05E20,JERRY,"Well, perhaps when she's released from the burn center, she'll see things differently."
S05E20,GEORGE,Perhaps.
S05E20,JERRY,"So, what was the fire? Just a couple of greasy hamburgers?"
S05E20,GEORGE,Yeah. Eric the Clown put it out with his big shoe.
S05E20,JERRY,"By the way, did you see this? (Hands George a magazine)"
S05E20,GEORGE,What's that?
S05E20,JERRY,"It's the Leonard Christian article about my show. Plus my gig in Miami got cancelled, I betcha it's because of the article."
S05E20,GEORGE,"Wow, he really does a number on you. (reads) ""Seinfeld froze like a deer in the headlights in the face of incessant heckling."""
S05E20,JERRY,I should have let her have it! I held back because of Kramer.
S05E20,GEORGE,You know what you oughta do. You should go to her office and heckle her.
S05E20,JERRY,"Yeah, right."
S05E20,GEORGE,"You know, like all the comedians always say, 'How would you like it if I came to where you work and heckled you?'"
S05E20,JERRY,"Yeah, that'd be something."
S05E20,GEORGE,"I'm not kidding, you should do it."
S05E20,JERRY,But wouldn't that be the ultimate comedian's revenge? I've always had a fantasy about doing that.
S05E20,GEORGE,"Well, go ahead! Do it!"
S05E20,JERRY,Why can't I?
S05E20,GEORGE,No reason!
S05E20,JERRY,"You know what? I think I'm gonna do that! She came down to where I work, I'll go down to where she works!"
S05E20,GEORGE,This is unprecedented!
S05E20,JERRY,"There's no precedent, baby!"
S05E20,GEORGE,What...are you using my babies now?
S05E20,JERRY,"Hey, nice shoes. What, you wear sandals to work? It's always nice to walk into a room and get the aroma of feet. That's real conducive to the work atmosphere. I'm sure your co-workers really appreciate it. 'Hey, let's go eat in Toby's office. Great idea! We can check on her bunions!'"
S05E20,TOBY,"You know, I have work to do here! I'm very busy!"
S05E20,JERRY,"Oh, is this disruptive? You find it hard to work with someone...interrupting?"
S05E20,TOBY,"Well, how would you like it if I called security?"
S05E20,JERRY,"Security? Well, I don't know how you're gonna make it in this business if you can't take it! Ya gotta be tough! Booo! Boooo!"
S05E20,TOBY,"No, (gets up out of her chair) that's it. (Kramer arrives; to Kramer) Get out of the way."
S05E20,KRAMER,"Hey, what's going on?"
S05E20,JERRY,Boo!
S05E20,KRAMER,What's happenin' here?
S05E20,JERRY,Hiss!
S05E20,KRAMER,(going after Toby) Toby! Toby!
S05E20,TOBY,(voice; screaming) My pinky toe!
S05E20,KRAMER,"(voice; yelling) Toby! (Shot of a shocked Kramer is shown) Oh, Oh!"
S05E20,KRAMER,What did you go up there to heckle her for?
S05E20,JERRY,Because she came down to the club and heckled me! Give her a taste of her own medicine! (George enters.)
S05E20,KRAMER,"Oh, YEAH! You gave her a taste of medicine, alright."
S05E20,JERRY,"Well, I didn't want her to have an accident."
S05E20,GEORGE,What accident?
S05E20,KRAMER,"Well, after he heckled Toby, she got so upset, she ran out of the building and a street sweeper ran over her foot and severed her pinky toe."
S05E20,GEORGE,That's unbelievable!
S05E20,KRAMER,"Yeah! Then after the ambulance left, I found the toe! So I put it in a Cracker Jack box, filled it with ice, and took off for the hospital."
S05E20,GEORGE,Wha.. you ran?
S05E20,KRAMER,"No, I jumped on the bus. I told the driver, ""I got a toe here, buddy - step on it."""
S05E20,GEORGE,Holy cow!
S05E20,KRAMER,"Yeah, yeah, then all of a sudden, this guy pulls out a gun. Well, I knew any delay is gonna cost her her pinky toe, so I got out of the seat and I started walking towards him. He says, ""Where do you think you're going, Cracker Jack?"" I said, ""Well, I got a little prize for ya, buddy - "" (Kramer throws two quick punches and a massive uppercut) - knocked him out cold!"
S05E20,GEORGE,How could you do that?!
S05E20,KRAMER,"Then everybody is screamin,' because the driver, he's passed out from all the commotion...the bus is out of control! So, I grab him by the collar, I take him out of the seat, I get behind the wheel and now I'm drivin' the bus."
S05E20,GEORGE,You're Batman.
S05E20,KRAMER,"Yeah. Yeah, I am Batman. Then the mugger, he comes to, and he starts chokin' me! So I'm fightin' him off with one hand and I kept drivin' the bus with the other, y'know? Then I managed to open up the door, and I kicked him out the door you know with my foot, you know - at the next stop."
S05E20,JERRY,You kept makin' all the stops?
S05E20,KRAMER,"Well, people kept ringin' the bell!"
S05E20,GEORGE,"Well, wha-what about the toe? What happened to the toe?"
S05E20,KRAMER,Well! I am happy to say that the little guy is back in place at the end of the line.
S05E20,GEORGE,You did all this...for a pinky toe?
S05E20,KRAMER,"Well, it's a valuable appendage."
S05E20,JOANNE,"So, Kramer found the toe, and they re-attached it."
S05E20,ELAINE,Really.
S05E20,JOANNE,"Yea, poor kid. What an ordeal."
S05E20,MICHAEL,And you know how extremely sensitive she is?
S05E20,ELAINE,I know.
S05E20,MICHAEL,She's gonna need our full support.
S05E20,ELAINE (wearily),"Yeah, right."
S05E20,OTHER CO-WORKERS IN HALLWAY,Look who's here! Toby! (Toby enters on crutches.)
S05E20,MICHAEL,"Toby, what can I do? Can I get you something?"
S05E20,TOBY,"Oh no, no thank you."
S05E20,MICHAEL,Toby please let us help. We're family.
S05E20,TOBY,"Oh well, I could use some coffee."
S05E20,JERRY,She got the promotion?
S05E20,ELAINE (standing in the doorway),Yep.
S05E20,JERRY,Why?
S05E20,ELAINE,"I'll tell ya why. Because of her pinky toe, that's why. Because Lippman felt so sorry for her, he didn't want to hurt her feelings."
S05E20,JERRY,Too bad.
S05E20,ELAINE,"Sure, the pinky toe is cute! But, I mean, what is it? It's useless! It does nothing. It's got that little nail that is just impossible to cut. What do we need it for?"
S05E20,JERRY,"Because Elaine, that's the one that goes 'wee-wee-wee all the home.'"
S05E20,ELAINE,Why don't you just shut the f-
S05E20,KRAMER (from his doorway),"Hey Elaine, did you hear the good news? Toby got promoted!"
S05E20,ELAINE,"Yes, I heard, Kramer - I work there, remember??"
S05E20,KRAMER,"Yeah, and you know what she told me? She said her first order of business is to put my coffee table book into the bookstores as soon as possible."
S05E20,ELAINE,"Oh, wonderful!"
S05E20,KRAMER,"You know, throughout this whole thing, she always kept a smile on her face."
S05E20,ELAINE,"Oh, of course! She's deranged."
S05E20,JERRY,"I went down to the magazine, I pleaded with him to come and see me again, finally he agreed to come down tonight, and he's going to write another article."
S05E20,RONNIE,I heard you went down to somebody's office and heckled them?
S05E20,JERRY,Damn right! We've been lapdogs long enough!
S05E20,RONNIE,"How could you do that? I mean, everybody's talking about it."
S05E20,JERRY,"Yeah well, it's about time one of us drew a line in the sand."
S05E20,RONNIE,"Jerry, you're like Rosa Parks. You opened the door for all of us. I can't wait till the next time someone heckles me."
S05E20,JERRY,"Yeah, well, it won't be long."
S05E20,ANNOUNCER,"Ladies and gentlemen, please welcome Jerry Seinfeld!"
S05E20,JERRY,Gotta go. (heads out on stage)
S05E20,GEORGE,Robin? Robin!
S05E20,ROBIN,"George, what is it? I'm working."
S05E20,GEORGE,"Robin, listen to me. The most amazing thing has happened. Kramer has opened my eyes. I think I've changed."
S05E20,ROBIN,What are you talking about?
S05E20,GEORGE,O.k....(is about to explain. Cut to Jerry on-stage.)
S05E20,JERRY,"I mean, Bozo the Clown...I mean does he really need ""the clown"" in his title, as clown? Bozo, ""the"" clown? Are we going to confuse him with Bozo the district attorney? Bozo the pope? There's no other Bozo..."
S05E20,GEORGE,"...you'll see, things will be different now - if you just give me one more chance."
S05E20,ROBIN,"L-listen, Listen...I gotta think about this. (walks away.)"
S05E20,GEORGE,"Alright, but I'm serious about this."
S05E20,RONNIE (points his water gun at the bartender),"Alright, hand it over man!"
S05E20,JERRY,...that's why men hunt and women nest.
S05E20,GEORGE (from backstage),"He's got a gun! He's got a gun! Get out of the way! (Tries to flee the bar in a mad panic. The audience in the club also goes nuts and heads for the exits. Jerry stands onstage, perplexed.)"
S05E20,ROBIN,George! This is Ronnie Kaye!
S05E20,GEORGE,"The prop comic? (Ronnie holds up his water gun and smiles.) Oh, hi...I didn't recognize you, what...did you get a haircut?"
S05E20,RONNIE (points to his nose),Nostrils.
S05E20,JERRY,George - could I have a word?
S05E21,KRAMER,"All right, get off at the next exit."
S05E21,JERRY,"Kramer, I've driven to east Hampton many times, I know the exit."
S05E21,KRAMER,"It's a great house, pool, sun deck? Yeah, I'll be there."
S05E21,JERRY,(To Elaine) You sure we're makin' the right move?
S05E21,ELAINE,"We gotta see the new baby anyway, at least we'll get a weekend in the Hamptons out of it."
S05E21,JERRY,Didn't they just have a baby?
S05E21,ELAINE,"That was two years ago, remember? 'Jeh-Ree, you gotta see the Bay-Bee! You gotta see the Bay-Bee!'"
S05E21,JERRY,Is it possible they're just having babies to get people to visit them?
S05E21,KRAMER,"Hey Jerry, you ever wear silk underwear?"
S05E21,JERRY,No.
S05E21,KRAMER,Put that on the top of your list.
S05E21,JERRY,"No, not for me. A little too delightful. Well, George and Jane should be almost there by now."
S05E21,ELAINE,"Oh, isn't that weird that George and Jane haven't had sex yet, but they're spending a weekend together?"
S05E21,JERRY,"I know, George is pretty pleased about it. It's like she signed a letter of intent."
S05E21,ELAINE,When's Rachel comin' out?
S05E21,JERRY,She's makin' the three o'clock train.
S05E21,ELAINE,"Her father is so religious, I'm just amazed that he's letting you see her again after that Schindler's List make-out session."
S05E21,JERRY,I bought him some kishka.
S05E21,KRAMER,What's that?
S05E21,JERRY,"It's kind of a stuffed meat thing. Israeli soldiers carry it. In case they're captured behind enemy lines, they eat it and it kills them."
S05E21,GEORGE,I never tasted a cough medicine I didn't love.
S05E21,JANE,Me too. I love cough medicine.
S05E21,GEORGE,"You see? We were made for each other. (Thinking to himself) It's amazing. If I reach out and touch her breast right not, she'd scream and throw me out of the car. But at this time tomorrow, I could touch it all I want."
S05E21,JANE,What's your favorite?
S05E21,GEORGE,Potussan. Ever try it with club soda?
S05E21,JANE,No.
S05E21,GEORGE,"Oh, very refreshing. (Thinking again) Sex is like joining a private club. I'll be the same me tomorrow, but suddenly, the no trespassing sign will be gone."
S05E21,JANE,Are we almost there?
S05E21,GEORGE,"Yeah, about ten, fifteen minutes. But I have to stop at a vegetable stand."
S05E21,JANE,What for?
S05E21,GEORGE,My mother loves Hampton tomatoes. She's nuts for Hampton tomatoes.
S05E21,JANE,Can you buy 'em later? I really wanna get some... sun.
S05E21,KRAMER,Hey Jerry. Rub some lotion on my back.
S05E21,JERRY,"Who are you, Mrs. Robinson?"
S05E21,KRAMER,"Come on, I'll rub some on yours."
S05E21,JERRY,"No, that's no sweet'ning the deal. No."
S05E21,GEORGE,"(To Jane) You know, when I was a kid, I once found a dollar and fifty cents in change on the bottom of the pool."
S05E21,JANE,(No feeling in her voice) You must've been excited.
S05E21,GEORGE,"Yeah. Hey, you know, I gotta go get these tomatoes. You wanna go for a ride?"
S05E21,JANE,I don't think so.
S05E21,GEORGE,"'Kay. I'll uh, I'll see you later. Anybody want some tomatoes?"
S05E21,JERRY,No thanks.
S05E21,KRAMER,No. (George leaves for the tomatoes)
S05E21,JANE,"I'm gonna take a dip. (She leaves for beach, Elaine enters with a shady hat on)"
S05E21,JERRY,And then there's Maude. (She sits down next to Jerry)
S05E21,ELAINE,"Look at my face, look at it. You see any lines?"
S05E21,JERRY,No lines.
S05E21,ELAINE,You know why? One word shade.
S05E21,JERRY,So when are we gonna see this baby? When is the momentous event?
S05E21,ELAINE,I don't know. They're takin' a nap or something.
S05E21,KRAMER,"I'm gonna go see if there are any girls on the beach. Elaine, you wanna come?"
S05E21,ELAINE,(Sarcastic) No thanks. I got plenty of girlfriends.
S05E21,JERRY,(Looking toward beach) Oh this is interesting.
S05E21,ELAINE,What?
S05E21,JERRY,Jane's topless. (They all look)
S05E21,KRAMER,Yo yo ma.
S05E21,JERRY,Boutros Boutros-Ghali.
S05E21,ELAINE,Nice rack. (Carol and Michael inside open back door)
S05E21,CAROL,"Come on, you guys. You can come and see the bay-bee!"
S05E21,JERRY,"Oh, in a minute, Carol."
S05E21,KRAMER,We're gonna be right there.
S05E21,JERRY,This is weird wild stuff. George hasn't even seen her yet.
S05E21,ELAINE,Why do you think we're getting the sneak preview?
S05E21,KRAMER,Maybe she's trying to create a buzz.
S05E21,ELAINE,What?
S05E21,KRAMER,"You know, get some good word of mouth goin'."
S05E21,JERRY,"Oh, here she comes. (They pretend to not have watched as Jane enters)"
S05E21,JANE,I'm thirsty. Anyone want a drink?
S05E21,JERRY,No thanks.
S05E21,ELAINE,I'm good.
S05E21,KRAMER,"Deh-deh-deh-deh- (Jane exits) All right, show's over. I'm goin' to the beach."
S05E21,CAROL,"Adam (the baby's name), Jerry and Elaine are here."
S05E21,ELAINE,"Oh, he's a cute little shnugly baby."
S05E21,CAROL,"Isn't he gorgeous? (Elaine looks at baby, only to be frightened and turn away)"
S05E21,ELAINE,Ugghh.
S05E21,CAROL,Is she gorgeous? (Elaine and Jerry looking away)
S05E21,ELAINE,"Oh, gorgeous, yes."
S05E21,JERRY,So very gorgeous.
S05E21,CAROL,"Michael, shut the door! You're letting bugs in."
S05E21,JERRY,Is it me or was that the ugliest baby you have ever seen?
S05E21,ELAINE,"Uh, I couldn't look. It was like the Pekinese."
S05E21,JERRY,"Boy, a little too much chlorine in that gene pool. (They sit) And, you know, the thing is, they're never gonna know, no one's ever gonna tell them."
S05E21,ELAINE,"Oh, you have to lie."
S05E21,JERRY,It's a must lie situation.
S05E21,ELAINE,"Yes, it's a must lie situation."
S05E21,JERRY,"You know, I don't think we should tell George we saw Jane topless."
S05E21,ELAINE,"No, I don't think so."
S05E21,JERRY,In fact remind me to tell Kramer too.
S05E21,KRAMER,"Oooh, lobsters."
S05E21,BEN,Oh this ointment should do it.
S05E21,CAROL,"How are you feeling, Adam? (She sees Elaine in the hall) Elaine! (Elaine enters) This is our pediatrician, Ben Feffa."
S05E21,ELAINE,Hi.
S05E21,CAROL,"Look at him, Elaine. How gorgeous is he? I ask you, how gorgeous?"
S05E21,ELAINE,(Looking at Ben) Pretty gorgeous.
S05E21,BEN,"Elaine, you have children?"
S05E21,ELAINE,"Me? Oh no, but I'd love to have a baby, I mean, I can't wait to have a baby. I'm just dyin' to have a baby."
S05E21,BEN,A beautiful woman like you should. You're quite breathtaking.
S05E21,ELAINE,Breathtaking? I'm breathtaking?
S05E21,CAROL,"And he's very particular. Ben, you're staying tonight, right?"
S05E21,BEN,"Uh, Sure. (Elaine celebrates to herself as Jerry enters and quickly looks away from the baby)"
S05E21,JERRY,"Ah, I'm gonna go pick up Rachel at the station."
S05E21,ELAINE,"Yeah, see ya."
S05E21,JERRY,Okay. (He leaves)
S05E21,CAROL,"Oh, just look at him!"
S05E21,BEN,"Yeah, he really is breathtaking. (Elaine confused by his comment)"
S05E21,RACHEL,Train was so crowded. I had to sit in the seat facing the wrong way.
S05E21,JERRY,Oh I like that. It's like going back in time. (George comes outside)
S05E21,GEORGE,Hey Rachel!
S05E21,RACHEL,(Quickly gets out of seat) Hi. I'm gonna go in there to change.
S05E21,GEORGE,What kind of a greeting was that?
S05E21,JERRY,She's got greeting problems.
S05E21,GEORGE,"Yeah. I love Hampton tomatoes. You know, you can eat 'em like apples. You know it's funny, the tomato never really took on as a hand fruit."
S05E21,JERRY,"Well, the tomato's an anomaly. So successful with the ketchup and the sauce, but you can't find a good one. (Kramer enters with a box of lobster)"
S05E21,KRAMER,"Hey, hey, hey! Look at what I got!"
S05E21,GEORGE,"Hey! Wow, the K-Man! (They walk into the kitchen inside)"
S05E21,JERRY,You got lobster for everybody?
S05E21,KRAMER,"Yeah, and they're fresh! Right out of the ocean."
S05E21,GEORGE,"This is fantastic. Man, what a weekend. Swimming, lobster for dinner..."
S05E21,KRAMER,"I know, it's great. And I saw Jane topless. (Jerry shows that 'damn' expression behind George)"
S05E21,GEORGE,"You saw who, what?"
S05E21,KRAMER,"Yeah, I saw Jane topless. Well, we all saw her."
S05E21,JERRY,(Jerry realizes the situation is hopeless) All right.
S05E21,GEORGE,You saw Jane topless?
S05E21,JERRY,"Well, when you went for the tomatoes she lied out topless."
S05E21,GEORGE,Oh you mean face down on her chest.
S05E21,JERRY,No.
S05E21,GEORGE,Face up on her back?
S05E21,JERRY,Yeah.
S05E21,GEORGE,Well why'd she do that?
S05E21,KRAMER,I guess she was hot.
S05E21,GEORGE,You mean she just laid there topless?
S05E21,KRAMER,"No, no, she got up, she walked around..."
S05E21,GEORGE,Walked around? And you looked?
S05E21,KRAMER,"Of course. She's got a great body, buddy. All right, I'm gonna go upstairs, I'll be right back."
S05E21,GEORGE,I can't believe that you saw her before me.
S05E21,JERRY,Think of me as a doctor. (They go outside again)
S05E21,GEORGE,"Well, how good a look did you get?"
S05E21,JERRY,Well what'd you mean?
S05E21,GEORGE,"Well, if she was a criminal and you had to describe her to a police sketch artist..."
S05E21,JERRY,They'd pick her up in about ten minutes.
S05E21,GEORGE,"Great, great. So anytime you want you can just visualize her naked."
S05E21,JERRY,(looking of into the distance) I guess that's true...
S05E21,GEORGE,"Stop it, stop it! It's not fair. It's not fair. I don't like this situation, Jerry. I don't like it one bit."
S05E21,JERRY,What do you want me to do? You wanna see Rachel naked?
S05E21,GEORGE,"Yes, yes! The punishment should fit the crime."
S05E21,JERRY,You can see me naked. I can offer you that.
S05E21,GEORGE,It's like I'm Neil Armstrong. I turn around for a sip of Tang and you jump out first.
S05E21,ELAINE,Nobody ever called me breathtaking before.
S05E21,JERRY,I've never been called breathtaking either.
S05E21,ELAINE,"I mean, if he thinks that that baby's breathtaking, then who's not breathtaking?"
S05E21,JERRY,Maybe he just said it because the mother was in the room.
S05E21,ELAINE,"Yeah, right, that's a possibility. I have to find out."
S05E21,JERRY,How are you gonna do that?
S05E21,ELAINE,I can be very clever.
S05E21,RACHEL,I'm gonna take a swim.
S05E21,ELAINE,"Oh, me too. I'll meet you down. (She goes in the hall and sees George) Oh, don't go in, Rachel's getting undressed."
S05E21,GEORGE,"Oh, okay. (Starts to walk other way and then walks to their room and goes in)"
S05E21,RACHEL,Hey!
S05E21,GEORGE,"Oh, sorry."
S05E21,RACHEL,Don't you knock?
S05E21,GEORGE,"I'm sorry, uh, it's not like I'm gonna see something I've never seen before."
S05E21,JERRY,You might have.
S05E21,GEORGE,I didn't.
S05E21,JERRY,You won't.
S05E21,RACHEL,"What'd you want anyway, George?"
S05E21,JERRY,"Yes, George. I'm kind of wondering myself. What is it what you want?"
S05E21,GEORGE,"No, I was just wondering... if you guys, uh, had any gum."
S05E21,JERRY,"Oh! So you were swimming in the pool, and you wanted some gum."
S05E21,GEORGE,"Yes, because the water was cold... and the chewing warms me up."
S05E21,RACHEL,We don't have any gum.
S05E21,GEORGE,Okay. (Chewing) Thanks anyway. (Continues to chew as he exits)
S05E21,RACHEL,Strange man.
S05E21,JERRY,Wait'll you get to know him.
S05E21,RACHEL,"So where is this baby, anyway?"
S05E21,JERRY,"Oh, check it out. I guarantee you've never seen anything quite so objectionable. It's down the hall, third door on your left. (Rachel walks down hall, walks in on George changing out of his swimsuit)"
S05E21,RACHEL,"(She screams) Oh my God! I'm sorry, I thought this was the baby's room. I'm really sorry. (She exits)"
S05E21,GEORGE,(realizing he was short changed) I was in the pool! I was in the pool!
S05E21,GEORGE,Did she do it on purpose?
S05E21,JERRY,"It was my fault, I told her the wrong door."
S05E21,GEORGE,I was supposed to see her. She wasn't supposed to see me.
S05E21,JERRY,So what?
S05E21,GEORGE,Well ordinarily I wouldn't mind. But...
S05E21,JERRY,But...
S05E21,GEORGE,Well I just got back from swimming in the pool. And the water was cold...
S05E21,JERRY,Oh... You mean... shrinkage.
S05E21,GEORGE,Yes. Significant shrinkage.
S05E21,JERRY,So you feel you were short changed.
S05E21,GEORGE,"Yes! I mean, if she thinks that's me she's under a complete misapprehension. That was not me, Jerry. That was not me."
S05E21,JERRY,"Well, so what's the difference?"
S05E21,GEORGE,What if she discusses it with Jane?
S05E21,JERRY,"Oh, she's not gonna tell Jane."
S05E21,GEORGE,How do you know?
S05E21,JERRY,Women aren't like us.
S05E21,GEORGE,"They're worse! They're much worse than us, they talk about everything! Couldn't you at least tell her about the shrinkage factor?"
S05E21,JERRY,"No, I'm not gonna tell her about your shrinkage. Besides, I think women know about shrinkage."
S05E21,GEORGE,How do women know about shrinkage?
S05E21,JERRY,Isn't it common knowledge?
S05E21,GEORGE & JERRY,(Elaine walking down the hall they notice her and wave her into the room) Elaine! Get! (She enters)
S05E21,GEORGE,Do women know about shrinkage?
S05E21,ELAINE,"What do you mean, like laundry?"
S05E21,GEORGE,No.
S05E21,JERRY,Like when a man goes swimming... afterwards...
S05E21,ELAINE,It shrinks?
S05E21,JERRY,Like a frightened turtle!
S05E21,ELAINE,Why does it shrink?
S05E21,GEORGE,It just does.
S05E21,ELAINE,I don't know how you guys walk around with those things.
S05E21,MICHAEL,"Thanks for the lobster, Kramer."
S05E21,KRAMER,"Rachel, aren't you gonna have any?"
S05E21,RACHEL,"Oh, no, I can't. I'm kosher, we don't eat shellfish."
S05E21,KRAMER,You mean you've never tasted lobster?
S05E21,RACHEL,No.
S05E21,KRAMER,"Wow. You're so pious. I really respect that. You know when you die, you're gonna get some special attention."
S05E21,CAROL,"Oh, the baby's crying. I'll go get him. He can sit with us."
S05E21,ELAINE & JERRY,No!
S05E21,JERRY,"No, you don't wanna do that. You'll be uncomfortable."
S05E21,ELAINE,"Yeah, finish eating. The baby's not gonna have any fun over here. We're-We're not fun for a baby."
S05E21,JERRY,"Yeah, the lobster'll scare him."
S05E21,CAROL,I'm gonna get him.
S05E21,GEORGE,"See, look at this. (wearing a very tight shirt) Rachel, my T-shirt shrunk. It used to be much bigger, and now it shrunk. You see, that's what water does. It shrinks things."
S05E21,ELAINE,"Really? Tell us more, Mr. Science. (Rachel whispers in Jane's ear, which prompts Jane to laugh)"
S05E21,GEORGE,"What're you doing? What're you, telling secrets? What're you laughing at?"
S05E21,JANE,"It's nothing, George."
S05E21,GEORGE,"You know, it's very impolite to tell secrets. Are you talking about me?"
S05E21,JANE,What is it with you?
S05E21,JERRY,(To George) Easy big fella.
S05E21,MICHAEL,"So Kramer, where'd you get all these lobster, at the Fleesher's Market?"
S05E21,KRAMER,"No, I got 'em in the ocean."
S05E21,MICHAEL,The ocean? What'd you mean?
S05E21,KRAMER,"Well, I found this rope and I kept tugging on it, and all these lobsters came up."
S05E21,MICHAEL,Those are commercial lobster traps. You can't take those lobsters from there. That's against the law.
S05E21,KRAMER,Take it easy. There's plenty of lobsters in the ocean for everyone.
S05E21,MICHAEL,My father was a lobsterman. He got up every morning at four and came home every night stinking of brine! He sent me through law school with the lobsters he caught! (Kramer stands up from table)
S05E21,CAROL,(Entering with baby) Here he is.
S05E21,KRAMER,Ahhh! (Shocked after seeing the baby)
S05E21,ELAINE,"Some night, huh?"
S05E21,BEN,"Yeah, I wish I had my telescope."
S05E21,ELAINE,"Some dinner, huh?"
S05E21,BEN,Nothing like fresh caught lobster.
S05E21,ELAINE,"Some house, huh?"
S05E21,BEN,It was built by Mark Fargman. He build a lot of these homes here.
S05E21,ELAINE,"Some ugly baby, huh?"
S05E21,BEN,What did you say?
S05E21,ELAINE,"(improvising) I said, uh, some snuggly baby."
S05E21,BEN,He is something.
S05E21,ELAINE,"Well, to tell you the truth, Dr. Feffa, I , I was surprised to hear you use a word like breathtaking to describe a baby, I mean, because you also used it referring to me."
S05E21,BEN,"Well, you know Elaine, sometimes you say things just to be nice. (Elaine relieved, then confused, not knowing if he was being nice to her or to the baby)"
S05E21,JERRY,You told her?
S05E21,RACHEL,"Yeah, what's the big deal?"
S05E21,JERRY,"You don't understand. This organ, it's very... schizophrenic."
S05E21,RACHEL,"Jerry, what the difference? You know, you're the ones obsessed with this stuff, not us. I'm sure it wouldn't matter to Jane."
S05E21,GEORGE,You're going back to New York now?
S05E21,JANE,"Yeah, I have some things to do."
S05E21,GEORGE,"Uh huh. Uh huh! I think you spoke to your little friend Rachel, that's what I think."
S05E21,JANE,So what if I did?
S05E21,GEORGE,And she didn't say something to you about a certain something?
S05E21,JANE,I don't know what you're talking about.
S05E21,GEORGE,"*I* think that *you* think that a certain *something* is not all that it could be, when in fact it is is all that it *should* be, and *more*!"
S05E21,JANE,(patronizing George) I'm sure it is.
S05E21,GEORGE,"Look, you don't understand. There was shrinkage."
S05E21,KRAMER,You looking for this? (Holding up lobster)
S05E21,RACHEL,"Oh, Kramer! You startled me."
S05E21,KRAMER,"Well, I thought you might wind up around here."
S05E21,RACHEL,"Yeah, well, I couldn't stop thinking about how everyone was enjoying the lobster so much an' well I thought I little taste wouldn't hurt, huh?"
S05E21,KRAMER,No I'm afraid I couldn't do that.
S05E21,RACHEL,Why not?
S05E21,KRAMER,"Well, that wouldn't be kosher."
S05E21,RACHEL,"C'mon, Kramer. I really want to try it."
S05E21,KRAMER,"Nah, I'm sorry, honey. Not on my watch."
S05E21,RACHEL,"Come on, Kramer."
S05E21,KRAMER,Heyahhh!
S05E21,RACHEL,I just heard a car drive out. What was that?
S05E21,JERRY,"Oh, that's just Jane driving home to New York in the middle of the night. (Rachel shocked)"
S05E21,CAROL,"George, thanks so much for making breakfast."
S05E21,ELAINE,"George, these are the best scrambled eggs I've ever tasted."
S05E21,KRAMER,Ya I didn't know you could cook.
S05E21,GEORGE,"Well, I'm just expressing my gratitude to our gracious host."
S05E21,BEN,"Yes, George, the whole breakfast is breathtaking. (hearing this Elaine looks at him extremely annoyed)"
S05E21,RACHEL,Good morning.
S05E21,ALL,"Hey, hey. Morning"
S05E21,RACHEL,"Kramer, I just want to thank you again for last night, you really saved me."
S05E21,MICHAEL,What happened?
S05E21,RACHEL,"Well, I almost tried the lobster, but Kramer stopped me."
S05E21,KRAMER,Well I knew you'd regret it for the rest of your life.
S05E21,RACHEL,"You're right, I would have."
S05E21,JERRY,"(Referring to George) Hey, look at this guy."
S05E21,GEORGE,A little breakfast.
S05E21,JERRY,Yeah.
S05E21,GEORGE,"(To Rachel) And, uh, you eat eggs, right?"
S05E21,RACHEL,"Yes, I do. Thank you."
S05E21,JERRY,"Geez, these are delicious. Where did you learn to make eggs like this?"
S05E21,RACHEL,Umm... This is so good.
S05E21,GEORGE,"Ah, enjoying them?"
S05E21,RACHEL,Mm-hmm.
S05E21,GEORGE,"Uh, good. You know, you might wanna try eating it with one of these. (Holds up lobster bib)"
S05E21,RACHEL,There's lobster in these eggs?
S05E21,GEORGE,"Not that much. You know, they tend to shrink in the water."
S05E21,JERRY,"Well, I guess I gotta go, too."
S05E21,ELAINE,"Well, this has turned out to be one *helluva* weekend. (Policeman knocks on door, Michael answers)"
S05E21,MICHAEL,Excuse me?
S05E21,POLICE,"I'm sorry to bother you, but we're trying to track down a lobster poacher that uh cleaned out on of the traps."
S05E21,KRAMER,Wonder what's goin' on.
S05E21,GEORGE,"Ah, I guess I should go up and apologize."
S05E21,MICHAEL,"There he is, officer. (Michael points to Kramer, Kramer waves to policeman)"
S05E21,RACHEL,Ahh! Don't you ever knock?
S05E21,GEORGE,I don't know why Rachel had to drive back with Michael and Carol.
S05E21,ELAINE,"Hey, if you saw me naked, I wouldn't want to ride back in the same car with you either."
S05E21,JERRY,I still can't believe Michael finked on Kramer.
S05E21,ELAINE,How is he gonna pay off a thousand dollar fine?
S05E21,JERRY,They got some sort of program.
S05E21,GEORGE,"Hey, there's a tomato stand, let's stop, I can get some more."
S05E21,JERRY,"Hey, isn't that Michael's car?"
S05E21,ELAINE,There's Rachel.
S05E21,GEORGE,Where? (He looks out window and gets hit by a tomato)
S05E22,MR. LIPPMAN,To your promotion.
S05E22,ELAINE,"Oh, thank you! (They drink) Mmm, Oh, thank you, Mr Lippman, I can't tell you how much I appreciate this. I mean, of course I deserve it."
S05E22,MR. LIPPMAN,"Well, you're really on your way now."
S05E22,ELAINE,You really oughtta do something about that cold.
S05E22,JERRY,You got a raise?
S05E22,ELAINE,"I don't fool around, (banging on the table) baby!"
S05E22,JERRY,I thought you said Pendant was in financial trouble.
S05E22,ELAINE,"They were, but they're being absorbed by Matsushimi, that big Japanese conglomerate."
S05E22,JERRY,"Oh, when did that happen?"
S05E22,ELAINE,They're signing the papers next week.
S05E22,JERRY,Does this mean they're gonna be publishing Kramer's coffee table book?
S05E22,ELAINE,"Yeah, they'll definitely do it now."
S05E22,JERRY,"Boy, you're on quite a streak. Job promotion, plus you're back with Jake Jarmal."
S05E22,ELAINE,"Yeah, it's gettin' serious, we're talking about moving in together."
S05E22,JERRY,"Boy, you really got it all, I'm sure Helen ""Girlie"" Brown would be very proud of you."
S05E22,JERRY,Speaking of having it all ... Where were you?
S05E22,GEORGE,I went to the beach. (Jerry and Elaine exchange looks)
S05E22,JERRY,"Oh, the beach."
S05E22,GEORGE,"It's not working, Jerry. It's just not working. (sits down next to Elaine)"
S05E22,JERRY,What is it that isn't working?
S05E22,GEORGE,"Why did it all turn out like this for me? I had so much promise. I was personable, I was bright. (Elaine turns showing disagreement) Oh, maybe not academically speaking, (Elaine nods correct) I was perceptive. I always know when someone's uncomfortable at a party."
S05E22,JERRY,(pointing to napkins; to Elaine) Could I get napkin over there?
S05E22,GEORGE,"It became very clear to me sitting out there today, that every decision I've ever made, in my entire life, has been wrong. My life is the complete opposite of everything I want it to be. Every instinct I have, in every of aspect of life, be it something to wear, something to eat ... It's all been wrong. (chuckles) Everywhere."
S05E22,WAITRESS ,"Tuna on toast, coleslaw, cup of coffee."
S05E22,GEORGE,"Yeah. No, no, no, wait a minute, I always have tuna on toast. Nothing's ever worked out for me with tuna on toast. I want the complete opposite of on toast. Chicken salad, on rye, un-toasted with a side of potato salad ... and a cup of tea. (laughs)"
S05E22,ELAINE,"Well, there's no telling what can happen from this."
S05E22,JERRY,"You know chicken salad is not the opposite of tuna, salmon is the opposite of tuna, 'cuz salmon swim against the current, (hand motion of the salmon swimming against the current) and the tuna swim with it. (hand motion of the tuna swimming with it)"
S05E22,GEORGE,(annoyed) Good for the tuna.
S05E22,ELAINE,"Ah, George, you know, that woman just looked at you."
S05E22,GEORGE,So what? What am I supposed to do?
S05E22,ELAINE,Go talk to her.
S05E22,GEORGE,"Elaine, bald men, with no jobs, and no money, who live with their parents, don't approach strange women."
S05E22,JERRY,"Well here's your chance to try the opposite. Instead of tuna salad and being intimidated by women, chicken salad and going right up to them."
S05E22,GEORGE,"Yeah, I should do the opposite, I should."
S05E22,JERRY,"If every instinct you have is wrong, then the opposite would have to be right."
S05E22,GEORGE,"Yes, I will do the opposite. I used to sit here and do nothing, and regret it for the rest of the day, so now I will do the opposite, and I will do something!"
S05E22,GEORGE,"Excuse me, uh I couldn't help but notice that you were looking in my direction."
S05E22,VICTORIA,"Oh, yes I was, you just ordered the same exact lunch as me."
S05E22,GEORGE,My name is George. I'm unemployed and I live with my parents.
S05E22,VICTORIA,I'm Victoria. Hi.
S05E22,JERRY,"(on the phone) Are you kidding? They can't cancel that show on me now, it's too late for me to book anything else for that weekend. Alright, alright ... okay, bye. (hangs up the phone)"
S05E22,KRAMER,"Hey. Buddy, it's all happening!"
S05E22,JERRY,What's happening?
S05E22,KRAMER,The coffee table book. It's a go-oo!
S05E22,JERRY,"Oh yeah, I heard all about it."
S05E22,KRAMER,You know what this means? I'm starting the book tour. First stop  Regis and Kathy Lee.
S05E22,JERRY,You're going on Regis and Kathy Lee?
S05E22,KRAMER,"Oh, you better believe it!"
S05E22,JERRY,I'll loan you my puffy shirt.
S05E22,KRAMER,"No, no, no."
S05E22,JERRY,What're you gonna talk about?
S05E22,KRAMER,"Well, coffee tables."
S05E22,JERRY,"Hello? What? Yeah, sure, I'll do it. I just had something cancelled the same weekend. Ok. Great. Bye. (hangs up the phone; turns to Kramer) You know, life is amazing. I just lost a job and five minutes later get another, same weekend, same money."
S05E22,KRAMER,You know who you are? Even Steven
S05E22,VICTORIA,Are you growing a beard?
S05E22,GEORGE,Why shave every day? It just grows right back.
S05E22,VICTORIA,I guess ...
S05E22,GEORGE,"I'm afraid I'm just not interested in how I present myself. If those kind of superficialities are important to you, this probably isn't gonna work."
S05E22,VICTORIA,"Hey watch, he just cut you off! Did you see that?!"
S05E22,GEORGE,Take it easy. Take it easy. It's not the end of the world.
S05E22,MAN #1 ,"Hey baby, how about a little tongue action, huh?"
S05E22,MAN #2 ,"Yeah, stick your tongue down his throat!"
S05E22,VICTORIA,What are we gonna do? Should we just move?
S05E22,GEORGE,That won't be necessary.
S05E22,GEORGE,"Shut your traps and stop kicking the seats! We're trying to watch the movie! And if I have to tell you again, we're gonna take it outside and I'm gonna show you what it's like! You understand me? Now, shut your mouths or I'll shut 'em for ya, and if you think I'm kidding, just try me. Try me. Because I would love it!"
S05E22,VICTORIA,"Are you sure you don't wanna come up, I mean, it's only nine thirty."
S05E22,GEORGE,I don't think we should. We really don't know each other very well.
S05E22,VICTORIA,"Who are you, George Costanza?"
S05E22,GEORGE,I'm the opposite of every guy you've ever met.
S05E22,THEATER MANAGER,"Excuse me, is your name Elaine?"
S05E22,ELAINE,Yes.
S05E22,THEATER MANAGER,Were you suposed to meet a Jake Jarmal here?
S05E22,ELAINE,Yeah.
S05E22,THEATER MANAGER,"Well, I'm afraid he's been in an accident."
S05E22,ELAINE,(gasp) An accident? What happened?
S05E22,THEATER MANAGER,"Well-he got side-swiped by a cab, but he's alright. He's in St.Vincent Hospital, room 907."
S05E22,ELAINE,Oh. Ok. Thank you.
S05E22,ELAINE,Could I have a box of Jujyfruits?
S05E22,COUNTERPERSON,(handing the Jujyfruits to Elaine) There you go.
S05E22,JAKE,"So, then, you know, the light was clearly green, I started walking, he skidded and he went right into my hip."
S05E22,ELAINE,"(With her mouth full of Jujyfruit) Oh, that is so terrible. That is so terrible, Jake. I mean, how can people be so stupid? Just sickening."
S05E22,ELAINE,You want one?
S05E22,JAKE,No thanks.
S05E22,ELAINE,So when do you think you're gonna get outta here?
S05E22,JAKE,Where did you get those?
S05E22,ELAINE,At the movies.
S05E22,JAKE,Didn't the theater manager give you the message before you went in?
S05E22,ELAINE,"Yeah, he did."
S05E22,JAKE,Then when did you get those?
S05E22,ELAINE,Right after ... that ...
S05E22,JAKE,"So you heard that I was in a car accident, and then decided to stop off for some Jujyfruit?"
S05E22,ELAINE,"Well... the counter...was right there, and..."
S05E22,JAKE,"I would think, under the circumstances, it would have sent you running out the building. Apparently, it didn't have any effect on you."
S05E22,ELAINE,"No, no, it does!"
S05E22,JAKE,"(angry) If you got into a car accident, I can guarantee you I wouldn't stop for Jujyfruit!"
S05E22,ELAINE,But...Jake...
S05E22,JAKE,"I would like to be alone now, please."
S05E22,ELAINE,"But, Jake, I didn't..."
S05E22,JAKE,Goodnight!
S05E22,POKER PLAYER #1,"Ah, whaddya say we call it a night?"
S05E22,POKER PLAYER #2,"Good idea, I'm kinda tired."
S05E22,POKER PLAYER #3,How'd you do?
S05E22,POKER PLAYER #4,Won 50.
S05E22,POKER PLAYER #2,Lost 72.
S05E22,POKER PLAYER #1,Won 37.
S05E22,POKER PLAYER #3,Lost 15.
S05E22,JERRY,(shocked) Broke even.
S05E22,REGIS,Can I bring out our next guest now?
S05E22,KATHY LEE,"Please, please."
S05E22,REGIS,"Young guy, he's got a new book coming out, and it's about, and this is the best part -"
S05E22,KATHY LEE,I love this.
S05E22,REGIS,It's a coffee table book about coffee tables! (holds the book up for the audience)
S05E22,KATHY LEE,Yeah. Is that clever? I think that is so clever!
S05E22,REGIS,I think so too. Did you get to meet him back stage?
S05E22,KATHY LEE,I did.
S05E22,REGIS,"I mean, he looks like a fun guy, doesn't he?"
S05E22,KATHY LEE,I love his hair.
S05E22,REGIS,"Yeah, oh, I do too. This guy could be a little bonkos. Really. Anyway, if you will, would you please welcome Kramer!"
S05E22,REGIS,"(shaking Kramer's hand) Hello, Kramer is here."
S05E22,KATHY LEE,"I don't know, maybe it's the hair or something!"
S05E22,REGIS,"Ah, well, yes Kramer. So, a coffee table book about coffee tables. Where did you come up with this idea?"
S05E22,KRAMER,"Yeah, well, ah, I'll tell you, uh Regis... actually, this is a true story. I umm I was skiing at the time."
S05E22,REGIS,"You know, when I'm skiing, Kramer, I'm trying not to kill myself, you're writing books!"
S05E22,KRAMER,"Yeah, well, now you kids don't go out and try that. You stay in school!"
S05E22,KATHY LEE,"Have you always had an interest in coffee tables, because, really, I-I love coffee tables, and I-I thought I was the only one."
S05E22,KRAMER,"You see the beauty of my book is, if you don't have a coffee table, it turns into a coffee table."
S05E22,KATHY LEE,Is that fabulous?
S05E22,REGIS,Look at this!
S05E22,KATHY LEE,Is that fabulous?
S05E22,REGIS,Fabulous!
S05E22,KATHY LEE,I want one of these.
S05E22,REGIS,Did I tell you this guy was bonkos?
S05E22,KATHY LEE,This coffee table (book) is full of pictures of celebrities' coffee tables.
S05E22,KRAMER,That's true. That's right.
S05E22,REGIS,"Yeah? Well, I'm not in there. Where's mine?"
S05E22,KRAMER,"Oh, it's on file, right here. (points to his head)"
S05E22,REGIS,"I'm tellin' ya, this guy's bonkos! He really is!"
S05E22,KATHY LEE,But he's adorable.
S05E22,REGIS,"Ya he is, he's a nice looking guy."
S05E22,KATHY LEE,It's all over my dress.
S05E22,REGIS,We'll be right back in a moment.
S05E22,JERRY,So it's all over?
S05E22,ELAINE,"Yeah, it got pretty nasty."
S05E22,JERRY,And what did you go back for? Jujyfruit?
S05E22,ELAINE,It's not like I went across the street. I bought the Jujyfruit and I got in a cab.
S05E22,JERRY,Why didn't you eat it in the cab?
S05E22,ELAINE,"Because I got popcorn too, and I ate that first."
S05E22,ELAINE,What's all this?
S05E22,JERRY,Played cards last night.
S05E22,ELAINE,Oh yeah? How'd you do?
S05E22,JERRY,Broke even.
S05E22,ELAINE,You always break even.
S05E22,JERRY,"Yeah, I know; like yesterday I lost a job, and then I got another one, and then I missed a TV show, and later on they re-ran it. And then today I missed a train, went outside and caught a bus. It never fails! I always even out!"
S05E22,ELAINE,Do you have twenty bucks?
S05E22,JERRY,What for?
S05E22,ELAINE,Just gimme twenty bucks.
S05E22,JERRY,(shocked) What the hell was that?
S05E22,ELAINE,Let's see if you get the twenty bucks back.
S05E22,JERRY,You know you could've thrown a pencil out the window and seen if that came back.
S05E22,ELAINE,"You know, things were going so good for me, you know, I got the job promotion, we were talking about moving in together -"
S05E22,JERRY,"Well, maybe next time someone's in a car accident you won't stop off for candy first."
S05E22,GEORGE,"Hey, I just found twenty dollars! I tell you this, something is happening in my life. I did this opposite thing last night. Up was down, black was white, good was -"
S05E22,JERRY,Bad.
S05E22,GEORGE,Day was -
S05E22,ELAINE,Night.
S05E22,GEORGE,Yes!
S05E22,JERRY,So you just did the opposite of everything?
S05E22,GEORGE,"Yes. And listen to this, listen to this; her uncle works for the Yankees and he's gonna get me a job interview. A front office kind of thing. Assistant to the traveling secretary. A job with the New York Yankees! This has been the dream of my life ever since I was a child, and it's all happening because I'm completely ignoring every urge towards common sense and good judgment I have had. This is no longer just some crazy notion. Elaine, Jerry, this is my religion."
S05E22,JERRY,So I guess your Messiah would be the Anti-Christ.
S05E22,GEORGE,Yes funny (laughs; hand clap) let's go.
S05E22,JERRY,Elaine ... look! A twenty!
S05E22,ELAINE,(not wanting to believe it) Oh my God.
S05E22,KRAMER,Hey boss.
S05E22,MR. LIPPMAN,Kramer. Come in.
S05E22,KRAMER,"How're you doin' there, big guy? (Puts his arm around the tobacco store Indian)"
S05E22,MR. LIPPMAN,"Uh, Ya, Have a seat."
S05E22,KRAMER,Al-righty (sits down) Have you got yourself a cold?
S05E22,KRAMER,"Woah, that's quite a honk!"
S05E22,MR. LIPPMAN,"Ya, thank you."
S05E22,KRAMER,Get yourself some vitamin C with rose hips and bioflavenoids.
S05E22,MR. LIPPMAN,"The reason I asked you in here, is I-I caught your appearance on uh ""Regis and Kathy Lee"" the other day and -"
S05E22,KRAMER,"Ya that was pretty good, huh?"
S05E22,MR. LIPPMAN,"An-Anyway, the thinking here is that it would be best i-if you uh didn't do any more of these shows."
S05E22,KRAMER,Because of the coffee thing?
S05E22,MR. LIPPMAN,"Kramer, I'm sorry."
S05E22,KRAMER,"What about ""Sonia Live""? Now you're not cancelling ""Sonia Live""?"
S05E22,MR. LIPPMAN,It's out -
S05E22,KRAMER,"She's a doctor, I got a thing for her."
S05E22,MR. LIPPMAN,"Kra-Kramer, I -"
S05E22,MR. CUSHMAN,Why don't you tell me about some of your previous work experience?
S05E22,GEORGE,Alrighty. Ah ... my last job was in publishing ... I uh got fired for having sex in my office with the cleaning woman.
S05E22,MR. CUSHMAN,Go on.
S05E22,GEORGE,"Ah, Alright, before that, I was in real estate. I quit, because the boss wouldn't let me use his private bathroom. That was it."
S05E22,MR. CUSHMAN,Do you talk to everybody like this?
S05E22,GEORGE,Of course.
S05E22,MR. CUSHMAN,My niece told me you were different.
S05E22,GEORGE,"I am different, yeah."
S05E22,MR. CUSHMAN,"I gotta tell ya, you are the complete opposite of every applicant we've seen. (gets out of his chair) Ah, Mr. Steinbrenner, sir. There's someone here I'd like you to meet. (George gets up and goes over) This is Mr. Costanza. He's one of the applicants."
S05E22,MR. STEINBRENNER,Nice to meet you.
S05E22,GEORGE,"Well, I wish I could say the same, but I must say, with all due respect, I find it very hard to see the logic behind some of the moves you have made with this fine organization. In the past twenty years you have caused myself, and the city of New York, a good deal of distress, as we have watched you take our beloved Yankees and reduced them to a laughing stock, all for the glorification of your massive ego!"
S05E22,MR. STEINBRENNER,Hire this man!
S05E22,SECRETARY,Tina Robbins is here to see you.
S05E22,MAN,Who's that?
S05E22,ELAINE,"Ah, it's my ex-roommate, she moved out four years ago, I-I've been sub-letting my apartment from her."
S05E22,MAN,"Alright, see ya. (Meets Tina in the door) Hey."
S05E22,TINA,Please.
S05E22,ELAINE,Hi Tina.
S05E22,TINA,Hi Elaine.
S05E22,ELAINE,"So, I haven't seen you in a while."
S05E22,TINA,"Elaine, we have a problem."
S05E22,ELAINE,"Well, what is it?"
S05E22,TINA,You're getting kicked out.
S05E22,ELAINE,Kicked out?! Why?!
S05E22,TINA,"Well, there's been a number of complaints."
S05E22,ELAINE,Yeah? Like what?
S05E22,TINA,"Well, like last Thanksgiving you buzzed up a jewel thief."
S05E22,ELAINE,"Ah, I didn't know who he was!"
S05E22,TINA,That's why there's a buzzer.
S05E22,ELAINE,What else?
S05E22,TINA,"Well, apparently, the week after that, you buzzed up some Jehova's Witnesses and they couldn't get them out of the building."
S05E22,ELAINE,What else have you got?
S05E22,TINA,"Well, let's see. (Takes out a list from her bag)"
S05E22,JERRY,"I'll tell you what the big advantage of homosexuality is. If you're going out with someone your size, right there you double your wardrobe."
S05E22,RACHEL,I suppose...
S05E22,JERRY,"Oh, come on, that's a huge feature. When they approach a new recruit, I'm sure that's one of the big selling points."
S05E22,RACHEL,(sighs) Jerry ...
S05E22,JERRY,Yes?
S05E22,RACHEL,I've been doing a lot of thinking.
S05E22,JERRY,Uh huh?
S05E22,RACHEL,"Well, I don't think we should see each other any more."
S05E22,JERRY,"Oh, that's okay."
S05E22,RACHEL,(confused) What?
S05E22,JERRY,"Nah, that's fine. No problem. I'll meet somebody else."
S05E22,RACHEL,You will?
S05E22,JERRY,"Sure. See, things always even out for me."
S05E22,RACHEL,Huh?
S05E22,JERRY,"It's fine. Anyway, it's been really nice dating you for a while. And uh good luck!"
S05E22,RACHEL,"Yeah, you too."
S05E22,JERRY,(leaving; singing) She'll be coming around the mountain...
S05E22,JERRY,The New York Yankees?!
S05E22,GEORGE,The New York Yankees!
S05E22,JERRY,"Ruth, Gehrig, DiMaggio, Mantle ... Costanza?"
S05E22,GEORGE,"I'm the assistant to the travelling secretary. I'm going on the road trips with 'em! I'll be on the plane... I'm working in Yankee Stadium! This is a dream, I'm busting, Jerry, I'm busting!"
S05E22,JERRY,I can't believe it.
S05E22,GEORGE,Ya!
S05E22,JERRY,Ya?
S05E22,ELAINE,(on buzzer) It's me.
S05E22,JERRY,(buzzes Elaine up) Come on up.
S05E22,GEORGE,"And I'm moving out of my parents' house, I'm taking that apartment on 86th street, remember the one we saw?"
S05E22,JERRY,That's a great place!
S05E22,GEORGE,"I'm back in business, baby!"
S05E22,JERRY,"George, I wouldn't get too excited about this stuff, you know, things have a way of evening out."
S05E22,GEORGE,"Hey! (to Elaine, who doesn't look too cheerful)"
S05E22,JERRY,Hi Elaine.
S05E22,ELAINE,Hi.
S05E22,JERRY,How're things going?
S05E22,ELAINE,How're things going? You wanna know how things are going? I'll tell you how things are going. I am getting kicked out of my apartment!
S05E22,JERRY,Why? Why are they doing that?
S05E22,ELAINE,I don't know! They have a list of grievances.
S05E22,JERRY,The jewel thief?
S05E22,ELAINE,"Yeah, the jewel thief."
S05E22,JERRY,What else?
S05E22,ELAINE,I put Canadian quarters in the washing machine. (disappointed) I gotta be out by the end of the month.
S05E22,GEORGE,"Well, you could move in with my parents. (chuckles)"
S05E22,ELAINE,"Was that the ... opposite ... of what you were going to say, or was that just your natural instinct? (She squeezes George's mouth between her fingers)"
S05E22,GEORGE,Instinct.
S05E22,ELAINE,Stick ... with the opposite. (Slaps George on the forehead)
S05E22,JERRY,"Elaine, don't get too down. Everything'll even out, see, I have two friends, you were up, (has his one hand up and his other hand down) he was down. Now he's up, (switches the positioning of his hands) you're down. You see how it all evens out for me?"
S05E22,SECRETARY,"Mr. Lippman, the people from Matsushimi are here."
S05E22,MR. LIPPMAN,"Oh ya alright... tell them I'll be right there. (tosses his handkerchief on Elaine's desk so he can tie his shoe) Oh man well, this is it, Elaine. You know, without this merger, we'd be out on the street. Boy, they sure saved us."
S05E22,ELAINE,"(noticing the forgotten handkerchief tries to stop call for Mr. Lippman with a mouth full of jujifruit) Oh, Mr. Lippman you forgot your handkerchief. Mr. Lippman, you forgot your handkerchief. It's on my desk."
S05E22,CHAIRMAN,(noticing Mr. Lippman in the hallway) Ah Lippman son. (Lippman smiles and is forced to enter his office) Lippman son. (speaks some Japanese)
S05E22,INTERPRETER,"Mr Lippman, it is with great pride that we undertake this partnership with your company."
S05E22,MR. LIPPMAN,"I ... I'm sorry, I can't shake your hand right now. It's germs."
S05E22,JERRY,Is that the end of it?
S05E22,GEORGE,"Yeah, it's the last one."
S05E22,JERRY,Alright.
S05E22,ESTELLE,"I can't believe you're moving out. (Grabs Kramer) Kramer, is this true? Is it really happening? It's ... it's like a dream."
S05E22,KRAMER,"Oh, it's true."
S05E22,GEORGE,"Alright, let's go."
S05E22,FRANK,Don't get in trouble with the Yankees. You be nice. (Slaps George's forehead)
S05E22,GEORGE,I'm not gonna be nice. That's how I got the job.
S05E22,ESTELLE,"Jerry, did you hear this?"
S05E22,JERRY,He knows what he's doing.
S05E22,GEORGE,"I just want the both of you to know how much you mean to me, and I love you both very, very much."
S05E22,JERRY,Opposite.
S05E22,ELAINE,I must've had at least eight in my mouth. I couldn't talk. I couldn't talk!
S05E22,JERRY,Why'd you have to eat so many?
S05E22,ELAINE,Because they're Jujyfruit. I like them. I didn't know it would start a chain reaction that would lead to the end of Pendant Publishing.
S05E22,JERRY,Not to mention the end of Kramer's coffee table book.
S05E22,KRAMER,"Yeah, you knew he had a cold. How'd you expect him to blow his nose? YEA!"
S05E22,ELAINE,Do you know what's going on here? Can't you see what's happened? I've become George.
S05E22,JERRY,Don't say that.
S05E22,ELAINE,It's true. I'm George! I'm George!
S05E22,GEORGE,"Greetings, people. Greetings. Greetings and salutations. What a beautiful day for a ball game. Let's play two! (Sits down, says to waitress ) Oh, I'll have the chicken salad on rye, my usual, you know what I get, darlin'. (Turns to the Gang) So, let's see, I had a little conversation today with Mr Don Mattingly - (to Elaine) he's the first base man."
S05E22,ELAINE,Uh huh.
S05E22,GEORGE,"We talked about his new batting stance, you know, I'm not crazy about it, but I said , 'Donny, go with it 'till it stops workin'.' Donny baseball. He's a helluva guy."
S05E22,KRAMER,"Wait, wait, wait, that's too much. Mine was more than yours."
S05E22,JERRY,Ah ... let's call it even.
S06E01,GEORGE,"O.K., Danny, take a swing. (Tartabull swings the bat.) N-No! No! No! You're opening up your shoulder."
S06E01,TARTABULL,Really?
S06E01,GEORGE,"No, not really. I'm just saying this to you because I like to hear myself talk. Yes, really!"
S06E01,TARTABULL (wiping sweat from his brow),"Alright, alright."
S06E01,GEORGE,What are all sweatin' for?
S06E01,TARTABULL,It's hot in this uniform.
S06E01,GEORGE,Hot? (Feels Tartabull's material.) What is this?
S06E01,TARTBULL,What is what?
S06E01,GEORGE,"This uniform, what's it made from?"
S06E01,TARTBULL,"I don't know, cotton?"
S06E01,GEORGE,"No. This is not cotton. Here, lemme see. (Tries to look at the tag on the uniform. Tartabull gets creeped out and resists.) Will you stop it? (Looks at the tag.) Oh. Of course. Polyester!"
S06E01,TARTABULL,So?
S06E01,GEORGE,I can't believe you're not playing in cotton.
S06E01,TARTABULL,"Well, this is what they give us."
S06E01,GEORGE,You know they used to make leisure suits out of this fabric?
S06E01,TARTABULL,You really think cotton's better?
S06E01,GEORGE,"Of course! Alright, maybe I'll say something to Buck."
S06E01,TARTABULL,"Yeah, good idea. Catch ya later. (Leaves.)"
S06E01,GEORGE,"Hey, don't embarrass me today. I got some friends in the stands. (George makes a swinging motion with an imaginary bat and pulls something in his back.)"
S06E01,HOT DOG VENDOR,Hot dogs here! Yankee franks!
S06E01,ELAINE,"Oh, you want one?"
S06E01,JERRY,Yeah.
S06E01,ELAINE,I'll get it. (Reaches in her bag for money.)
S06E01,JERRY,"That's alright, I got it."
S06E01,ELAINE,Jerry!
S06E01,JERRY,"Elaine, stop it."
S06E01,ELAINE,"Hey, just because I'm not working doesn't mean I haven't got any money. (To vendor) Yo! Dogs! Two!"
S06E01,JERRY,I'm sorry.
S06E01,ANNOUNCER ON P.A. SYSTEM,"Your attention please...the New York Yankees would like to welcome Miss Connecticut, Miss Rhode Island and Miss North Dakota, all of whom will be competing in the Miss America pageant this weekend in Atlantic City. (The three contestants make their way to their seats, right across the aisle from Jerry and Elaine.)"
S06E01,JERRY (to Elaine),"Now, there's a career path you may have overlooked."
S06E01,ELAINE,"Ooh, I gotta check my machine. I'm waiting to hear about an interview. Doubleday is looking for somebody to replace Jackie Onassis."
S06E01,JERRY,"Oh, she worked at Doubleday...?"
S06E01,ELAINE,"Yeah, she was an editor."
S06E01,JERRY,"Right, just like you."
S06E01,ELAINE,Yeah. Can you hold my seat? (Elaine gets up.)
S06E01,CROWD,Hey! Down in front! (Elaine clambers over Jerry and exits.)
S06E01,JERRY (offers a hot dog to Miss Rhode Island),Hot dog?
S06E01,MISS RHODE ISLAND,"No, thanks. I'm watching my weight."
S06E01,JERRY,"Ah. I'm watching my height. My doctor doesn't want me to get any taller. So you're Miss, uh..."
S06E01,MISS RHODE ISLAND,Rhode Island.
S06E01,JERRY,I was almost Mr. Coffee. They felt I was a little too relaxed. (Miss Rhode Island laughs.)
S06E01,GEORGE,Miss Rhode Island? When are you seeing her?
S06E01,JERRY,"Tonight. I have to call her, she's staying in a hotel."
S06E01,GEORGE,You're incredible.
S06E01,JERRY,"And get this - I'm working in Atlantic City this weekend, and she's going to be down there for the pageant."
S06E01,GEORGE,"What if she becomes Miss America? You could be dating Miss America, Jerry!"
S06E01,JERRY,"The only bad thing is, we have to go out with a chaperone."
S06E01,GEORGE,"Chaperone? What, are you kidding?"
S06E01,JERRY,"No, it's part of the contest rules."
S06E01,GEORGE,What does the chaperone do?
S06E01,JERRY,"I don't know, she just sits there."
S06E01,GEORGE,Can she talk?
S06E01,JERRY,I'm not sure if she's allowed to talk. (Picks up the phone and dials.)
S06E01,GEORGE,You're calling her?
S06E01,JERRY,"Yeah. (sings) There she is...Miss - yes, room 417 please? Karen Hanson?"
S06E01,GEORGE,"Hey, did you know that the Yankees don't wear cotton jerseys?"
S06E01,JERRY,"Of course, they're polyester."
S06E01,GEORGE,"Well, what is that? That's a crime! Do you know how hot those things get? They should be wearing cotton."
S06E01,JERRY,Why do they wear polyester?
S06E01,GEORGE,I don't know. That's all gonna change.
S06E01,JERRY,You're going to do something about it?
S06E01,GEORGE,Why shouldn't I?
S06E01,JERRY (doubtfully),No reason...
S06E01,LANDIS,"Of course, Jackie O. was a great lady. Those are going to be some tough shoes to fill. Everyone loved her. She had such...grace."
S06E01,ELAINE (gushing),Yes! Grace!
S06E01,LANDIS,Not many people have grace.
S06E01,ELAINE,"Well, you know, grace is a tough one. I like to think I have a little grace...not as much as Jackie -"
S06E01,LANDIS,"You can't have ""a little grace."" You either have grace, or you...don't."
S06E01,ELAINE,"O.K., fine, I have...no grace."
S06E01,LANDIS,And you can't acquire grace.
S06E01,ELAINE,"Well, I have no intention of ""getting"" grace."
S06E01,LANDIS,Grace isn't something you can pick up at the market.
S06E01,ELAINE (fed up),"Alright, alright, look - I don't have grace, I don't want grace...I don't even say grace, O.K.?"
S06E01,LANDIS,Thank you for coming in.
S06E01,ELAINE,"Yeah, yeah, right."
S06E01,LANDIS,"We'll make our choice in a few days, and we'll let you know."
S06E01,ELAINE (stands up),"I have no chance, do I?"
S06E01,LANDIS,No. (They shake hands.)
S06E01,LANDIS'S INTERCOM,Justin Pitt to see you.
S06E01,ELAINE,Justin Pitt?
S06E01,LANDIS,He was a very close friend of Mrs. Onassis's.
S06E01,ELAINE,"""Mrs. Onassis's""? That's hard to pronounce."
S06E01,LANDIS,Excuse me?
S06E01,ELAINE,Nothing. (Mr. Pitt comes in with some papers in hand.)
S06E01,PITT,"Mrs. Landis, there's something wrong with this copying machine, it's all coming out slanted. Now, I don't know if this is your department or not."
S06E01,LANDIS,"Justin Pitt, this is Elaine Benes. (Elaine turns around. With sunglasses and a scarf on her head, she bears a close resemblance to Jackie O.)"
S06E01,PITT (clearly affected by Elaine's appearance),Charmed.
S06E01,ELAINE,I was a great admirer of Mrs. Onass-sis-sis-sis...
S06E01,JERRY,"Hello, Karen? It's Jerry Seinfeld. Oh, that's very sweet of you. You know, you better be careful, you don't want to get too congenial. They'll slap that ""Miss Congeniality"" on you, and you'll congene yourself right out of the contest. So, what time do you want to get together later? What? So what, we don't need the chaperone. (To George) The chaperone can't make it. (To Karen) Oh, you're not gonna get disqualified! So, we're not going? (Kramer enters.) Hold on one second. (To Kramer) Hey, what are you doing tonight?"
S06E01,KRAMER,Nothin.'
S06E01,JERRY,"I'm going out with one of the Miss America contestants, you wanna go?"
S06E01,KRAMER,What state?
S06E01,JERRY,Rhode Island.
S06E01,KRAMER,They're never in contention.
S06E01,GEORGE,How do you know?
S06E01,KRAMER,Because I've seen every Miss America pageant since I was six.
S06E01,JERRY,"Look, do you want to go or not? I'll buy you dinner."
S06E01,KRAMER,Giddy-up!
S06E01,JERRY (to Karen),I think I got someone!
S06E01,PITT (looking at Elaine and smiling),"The resemblance is uncanny. (Elaine, sipping soda through a straw, looks up with a sour expression on her face.) Even the brown eyes."
S06E01,ELAINE,"Well, a lot of people have brown eyes."
S06E01,PITT,"No, there's something else. An indefinable quality."
S06E01,ELAINE,Grace?
S06E01,PITT,"Grace, yes."
S06E01,ELAINE,You think Ihave grace?
S06E01,PITT,"Some grace, yes."
S06E01,ELAINE,Just some?
S06E01,PITT,"Well, you don't want too much grace or you won't be able to stand."
S06E01,ELAINE (laughing),"Oh, Mr. Pitt."
S06E01,PITT,"Elaine, I want you to come and work for me as my personal assistant. Now, I'll pay you the same as Pendant, but I would need you to start right away."
S06E01,GEORGE,"Hey, Buck. Talk to you for a second?"
S06E01,SHOWALTER,"Sure, George."
S06E01,GEORGE,How's everything going? Everything O.K.?
S06E01,SHOWALTER,"Well, all of a sudden there's a problem with Tartabull's swing..."
S06E01,GEORGE,"Listen, Buck, I uh...obviously I don't need to talk to you about the importance of player morale, but uh...I've been talking to some of the guys, and some of them - I don't want to mention any names - but some of them...they're not too happy with the polyester uniforms."
S06E01,SHOWALTER,How so?
S06E01,GEORGE,"Well, they get very hot in the polyester. You know, it's not a natural fibre. I think they would prefer cotton."
S06E01,SHOWALTER,"Cotton, huh?"
S06E01,GEORGE,"Yeah. Cotton breathes, you see, it's much softer. Imagine playing games and your team is five degrees cooler than the other team. Don't you think that would be an advantage? They're cooler, they're more comfortable...they're happier - they're gonna play better."
S06E01,SHOWALTER,"You may have something there, George."
S06E01,GEORGE,Oh - I've got something.
S06E01,SHOWALTER (considering),Hmm. Cotton uniforms.
S06E01,JERRY,Congratulations!
S06E01,ELAINE,"Yeah! And the best part is, I still get to look for work in publishing."
S06E01,JERRY,"Now, what is it that you do, exactly?"
S06E01,ELAINE,I attend to his personal affairs.
S06E01,JERRY,Like what?
S06E01,ELAINE,"Well, like tomorrow for example, I have to uh...I have to buy him some socks."
S06E01,JERRY,Really! Socks!
S06E01,ELAINE,Yeah. White ones. Like the ones you wear with sneakers.
S06E01,JERRY,"Hey, maybe you can pick me up some underwear! (Kramer enters.)"
S06E01,KRAMER (shows Jerry his outfit),"So, what do you think? Does this work?"
S06E01,JERRY,"Listen...tonight, after we finish eating, you make like you got something else to do and just ""recede into the night,"" if you know what I mean."
S06E01,KRAMER,No way!
S06E01,JERRY,What?
S06E01,KRAMER,"Look, if you think I'm just going to step aside and do nothing while you defile this woman, you're crazy."
S06E01,JERRY,"I'm not going to ""defile"" her!"
S06E01,KRAMER,"That's right, because I'm going to see it doesn't happen. Look, Jerry, these girls are Miss America contestants. It's every little girl's dream. And I'm not going to let you trample that dream and make a mockery of everything the pageant stands for."
S06E01,JERRY,But -
S06E01,KRAMER (holds up his hand),AAAH! No buts! Those are my rules.
S06E01,JERRY,But wait a minute...
S06E01,KRAMER,"Now, if you want to go out and have some good, wholesome fun with a nice girl, I'd be glad to help you out...if you're looking for something more than that, you've got the wrong guy, buddy! (Jerry tries to get a word in during this entire speech, but Kramer won't budge an inch.)"
S06E01,KRAMER,"If you were Miss America, what would you do to make the world a better place?"
S06E01,KAREN,"As Miss America, I would try and bring an end to world hunger. If every person sacrificed one meal a week, there would be enough to feed the whole world!"
S06E01,JERRY,That's a hell of a plan. (To Kramer) Listen -
S06E01,KRAMER (to Karen),What advice would you give young people?
S06E01,JERRY,"Alright, Kramer!"
S06E01,KRAMER,"This is important stuff! She's got to be able to answer these questions. She's not going to have time to think, out there, with millions of people watching her. Any hesitation could cost her the crown. You know, poise counts."
S06E01,KAREN,"You really know a lot about this, don't you?"
S06E01,KRAMER,"Oh yeah, like last year? Miss Texas? Now, she should have won easily, but she lost points in the swimsuit competition."
S06E01,KAREN,"Well, what could she have done?"
S06E01,KRAMER,Tape her breasts together. (Jerry is shocked.)
S06E01,KAREN,What else?
S06E01,KRAMER,"Well, take you for example. Now, you're very attractive, but you got a big waist."
S06E01,JERRY,"Hey, come on!"
S06E01,KAREN,"No, no...it's O.K. (To Kramer) Go on."
S06E01,KRAMER,"Well, I'd recommend a waist cincher."
S06E01,KAREN,Really.
S06E01,KRAMER,"Oh, yeah. Just - thip! - suck you in."
S06E01,JERRY,I'll be right back. (Leaves the table.)
S06E01,KRAMER,"So, what's your talent?"
S06E01,KAREN,Magic.
S06E01,KRAMER,Mmm. I'm thinking of a number from one to ten.
S06E01,KAREN,Six.
S06E01,KRAMER,"No, five. But you were close."
S06E01,ANNOUNCER #1,And the Yankees take the field!
S06E01,ANNOUNCER #2,"Is it my imagination, or do the Yankees look a little different tonight? I can't put my finger on it..."
S06E01,ANNOUNCER #1,"Well, from what I understand, they've switched to cotton uniforms."
S06E01,ANNOUNCER #2,"They seem blousier, softer..."
S06E01,ANNOUNCER #1,"Well, it is a natural fibre..."
S06E01,KRAMER,How's your evening?
S06E01,KAREN,"Well, I'm wearing this red dress -"
S06E01,KRAMER,Stop right there.
S06E01,KAREN,No good?
S06E01,KRAMER,Disaster.
S06E01,KAREN,Why?
S06E01,KRAMER,"Well, you got brown eyes. You want to wear a green dress."
S06E01,KAREN,That makes sense. (The limo stops at Karen's hotel.)
S06E01,JERRY,"Well, here we are..."
S06E01,KAREN,"Kramer, would you consider being my personal consultant for the pageant?"
S06E01,KRAMER,"Okay. But if I'm going to do this, we play by my rules or we don't play at all."
S06E01,KAREN,"I am in your hands. (They shake hands.) Well! Oh, good night, Jerry. (They're about to kiss, but Kramer stops them by clearing his throat.) Kenneth will take you home. (She gets out, leaving Jerry staring at Kramer with an angry expression on his face.)"
S06E01,KRAMER,Hey.
S06E01,JERRY,"Well, if it isn't Mr. Blackwell."
S06E01,KRAMER,"Oh, come on."
S06E01,JERRY,"And that waist cincher, that was the topper!"
S06E01,KRAMER,"Oh, you're poo-pooing!"
S06E01,JERRY,"Yes, I poo-poo."
S06E01,KRAMER,"Well, let me tell you something. I'm taking this kid to the top. To the top, Jerry! We're going for the crown, and you can't stop her!"
S06E01,JERRY,I don't want to stop her!
S06E01,KRAMER,"You can't stop her, Jerry! Oh, I've seen 'em come and go, but this kid has got something! (Turns to leave.)"
S06E01,JERRY,"Yeah, so do you. (George enters with a newspaper.)"
S06E01,GEORGE,"Well, did you see it?"
S06E01,JERRY,See what?
S06E01,GEORGE,"The uniforms! Did you see how they played? Listen to these comments! (reads from the paper) ""Wade Boggs 'What a fabric! Finally we can breathe.' Luis Palonia 'Cotton is king.' Paul O'Neill 'I never dreamed anything could be so soft and fluffy.' """
S06E01,JERRY,"Boy, they really do sound comfortable."
S06E01,GEORGE (noticing Jerry's suitcase),"Hey, where ya goin'?"
S06E01,JERRY,I'm working in Atlantic City.
S06E01,GEORGE,Really!
S06E01,JERRY,"Yeah. Hey, you're not working this weekend, why don't you come down?"
S06E01,GEORGE,Atlantic City? (thinks) Yes! Yes! I will go to Atlantic City. I'm in. I'm down.
S06E01,JERRY,"You know what, maybe Elaine wants to go too, lemme call her. (Picks up the phone.) She's at Mr. Pitt's, I think I got the number..."
S06E01,ELAINE,"So, what do you think?"
S06E01,PITT (pulling up the socks),No.
S06E01,ELAINE,You don't like them?
S06E01,PITT,"No, I don't like them."
S06E01,ELAINE,What's wrong?
S06E01,PITT,They're too tight.
S06E01,ELAINE,Too tight?
S06E01,PITT,"There's no elastic, you need to pull too much (pulls them up more)."
S06E01,ELAINE (examining the socks),I think they look good!
S06E01,PITT,They're cutting off the circulation.
S06E01,ELAINE,"Alright, well, I'll just take them back. (The phone rings.)"
S06E01,PITT,Hello?
S06E01,JERRY,"Hi, Mr. Pitt! Is Elaine there?"
S06E01,PITT (hands the phone to Elaine),It's for you.
S06E01,ELAINE,Sorry. Hello?
S06E01,JERRY,"Hey Elaine, it's me."
S06E01,ELAINE,Jerry?
S06E01,JERRY,We're going to Atlantic City.
S06E01,ELAINE,Really? When?
S06E01,JERRY,"Today, right now! Are you in?"
S06E01,ELAINE,"One second, hang on. (To Mr. Pitt) Excuse me, Mr. Pitt? Would it be alright if I got you the socks tomorrow?"
S06E01,PITT,Tomorrow?
S06E01,ELAINE,Yes.
S06E01,PITT,But I was hoping for my new socks today!
S06E01,ELAINE,"Well, it's just one more day."
S06E01,PITT,I'm sorry. I must have them today.
S06E01,ELAINE (to Jerry),I can't go.
S06E01,JERRY,Why not?
S06E01,ELAINE,Because I have to return the socks and get different ones.
S06E01,PITT,Elaine!
S06E01,ELAINE,I gotta go. (Hangs up.)
S06E01,KRAMER,"No. Alright, watch me now. (Karen sits on the bed. Kramer walks across the room like a Miss America contestant with a big smile on his face.) Turn, back, head up, shoulders back...posture. You see? Posture."
S06E01,KAREN,"Yes, I see. O.K."
S06E01,KRAMER,"Let's try a few more questions, alright? (Karen stands up.) If you were Miss America, and the U.S. was on the brink of a nuclear war, and the only way the conflict could be averted was if you agreed to sleep with the enemy's leader, what would you do?"
S06E01,KAREN,"Kramer, are these questions really that important...?"
S06E01,KRAMER,"Yes, they're important! If you stumble, if you hesitate, you can kiss the crown goodbye. Now if I've told you once, I've told you a thousand times - poise counts! It's just as important as the others. Swimsuit! Evening wear! Talent! POISE!"
S06E01,GEORGE,Hey.
S06E01,JERRY,Hey.
S06E01,GEORGE,How was the show?
S06E01,JERRY,Good. How was the roulette?
S06E01,GEORGE,"I won fifty bucks! Boy, this is great. Too bad Elaine's not here."
S06E01,JERRY,"Yeah, all she had to do was buy Mr. Pitt a pair of socks!"
S06E01,PITT,"It's good, but..."
S06E01,ELAINE,But what??
S06E01,PITT,Ultimately I don't think they'll stay up.
S06E01,ELAINE (pulling up Pitt's socks),"No, no! They'll stay up!"
S06E01,PITT,"For a while, yes, but not in the long run."
S06E01,ELAINE,But that's why I got you the tighter ones! (Holds them up.)
S06E01,PITT,"Oh, forget about those! (Takes the socks from Elaine and throws them on the floor.) Why do you keep mentioning those?"
S06E01,ELAINE,What do you want!?
S06E01,PITT,"I want a decent sock that's comfortable, that will stay on my foot!!"
S06E01,JERRY,What the hell is that?
S06E01,GEORGE,"I don't know, it sounds like pigeons or something!"
S06E01,JERRY (getting out of bed),"Well, I can't sleep with that noise."
S06E01,GEORGE,Me either. Is there anything you can do to shut them up?
S06E01,JERRY,"Wait a second. (Grabs the icebucket off the counter.) This'll scare 'em off. (Dumps the bucket of water over the balcony. We hear a loud squawking noise and the flapping of wings, then the noise is gone. Jerry gets back into bed.) Well, good night, Ollie."
S06E01,GEORGE,"Good night, Stan."
S06E01,KRAMER,What is it?
S06E01,KAREN,My doves! They're dead! I trained those birds for eight years! How am I supposed to do my magic act now?
S06E01,KRAMER,How did this happen?
S06E01,KAREN,"They like it outside, so I kept them in a cage on the terrace...then I found them dead in a pool of water!"
S06E01,"KRAMER (goes out on the terrace to look, and slips in the water)","Well, how did this happen?"
S06E01,KAREN,It must have been an accident.
S06E01,KRAMER,Accident? This was no accident. These doves were murdered.
S06E01,KRAMER,"Well, that's it! She's out of the pageant!"
S06E01,JERRY,What? Why? What happened?
S06E01,KRAMER,Her birds are dead.
S06E01,JERRY,Birds?
S06E01,KRAMER,"Yeah, birds. She's got these trained doves, she does this magic act, that was her talent for the pageant. You know what I think, Jerry? I think somebody murdered those doves. Somebody wanted her out of that contest bad. Somebody who was just eaten up with jealousy. Somebody who just couldn't stand to have the spotlight taken off of them! (Kramer turns around and notices the empty icebucket on the edge of Jerry's balcony.)"
S06E01,JERRY,"What are you looking at? (Kramer goes out onto the terrace and looks down.) Oh, that! We had to leave that outside, last night, because the water was making the room too cold."
S06E01,KRAMER (comes back inside with his finger pointed at Jerry),"You killed them, didn't you?"
S06E01,JERRY,"No, you don't understand - it's not what you think! It was an accident!"
S06E01,KRAMER,"Well, don't think you've won, because you haven't! This kid is a fighter! And if you think I'm gonna let a couple of dead birds get in our way, you're crazy!"
S06E01,JERRY,"Kramer, you gotta explain to her what happened...! (Kramer exits.)"
S06E01,GEORGE (comes out of the bathroom brushing his teeth),What was that all about?
S06E01,JERRY,"Oh, it was just Kramer...apparently I killed Miss Rhode Island's doves with a bucket of water last night."
S06E01,GEORGE,Oh. (Goes back into the bathroom.)
S06E01,KAREN,"O.K., this is it!"
S06E01,KRAMER,How ya feelin'?
S06E01,KAREN,I'm a little nervous!
S06E01,KRAMER,There's nothing to be nervous about.
S06E01,KAREN,But I've never sung before in my life!
S06E01,PHILBIN,"And now, let's welcome Karen Ann Hanson, Miss Rhode Island!"
S06E01,JERRY,I heard those doves were really incredible.
S06E01,GEORGE,That's a shame. (Karen is shown singing off-key on the television.)
S06E01,JERRY,It's like watching an animal get tortured.
S06E01,GEORGE,"Hey, hey! Yankee game! (Changes the channel.)"
S06E01,JERRY,"Oh, great! Alright. (We hear the announcers calling the game.)"
S06E01,ANNOUNCER #1,And the Yankees take the field!
S06E01,ANNOUNCER #2,"What is with the Yankees? They look like they're having trouble running, they can't move!"
S06E01,ANNOUNCER #1,"It's their uniforms, they're too tight, they've shrunk! They're running like penguins! Forget this game!"
S06E01,ANNOUNCER #2,"Oh my God, Mattingly just split his pants!"
S06E01,JERRY,That's a shame.
S06E01,KRAMER,Poise. Poise!
S06E02,STATIONER,May I help you?
S06E02,ELAINE,"Yeah, uh, I'm looking for a Rollamech 1000 mechanical pencil."
S06E02,STATIONER,"Oh, I know the Rollamech 1000."
S06E02,ELAINE,"No, I'm sure you do."
S06E02,STATIONER,They're pretty expensive.
S06E02,ELAINE,"Well, it's for my boss."
S06E02,STATIONER,What do you do?
S06E02,Ex,Whatever.
S06E02,STATIONER,"Well, we don't have any in stock right now but I would be happy to order it for you. Just give me your phone number and when it comes in I'll give you a call. You're name is?"
S06E02,ELAINE,Elaine.
S06E02,STATIONER,"Elaine, . . . and your last name?"
S06E02,ELAINE,"It's just Elaine, like Cher. Ha ha ha"
S06E02,STATIONER,And your number?
S06E02,ELAINE,"Uh, aw, KL5-239O."
S06E02,STATIONER,Okay. Thanks a lot. You'll be hearing from me.
S06E02,ELAINE,"Okay, (to Jerry) Move along. . ."
S06E02,JERRY,Why did you give him MY number?
S06E02,ELAINE,I think he's got ideas.
S06E02,JERRY,I wonder if any woman ever said that about Einstein?
S06E02,JERRY,Call me when the pencil comes in Okay?
S06E02,ELAINE,"Just call me when the new pen comes in, okay?"
S06E02,JERRY,Why does Mr. Pitt prefer a pencil to a pen anyway? Hey. Look who's here.
S06E02,GEORGE,"Hey, hey."
S06E02,ELAINE,Hey hey
S06E02,JULIE,Hi Jerry.
S06E02,JERRY,Hi Julie.
S06E02,GEORGE,"Elaine, Julie."
S06E02,ELAINE,Hi.
S06E02,JULIE,Hi.
S06E02,JULIE,"Oh, hi. Elaine's my middle name."
S06E02,ELAINE,"Oh, mine's ""Ike""."
S06E02,GEORGE,"Hey, wanna get some lunch?"
S06E02,JERRY,Just had a big bowl of Kix.
S06E02,GEORGE,"Ah, well, that's very mature. What about you?"
S06E02,ELAINE,"Ah, no."
S06E02,JULIE,"Please come, Elaine."
S06E02,ELAINE,"No, no. How about if you bring me back something?"
S06E02,GEORGE,"Sure, all right, what do you want?"
S06E02,ELAINE,"Um, hum, I don't know.. . . A big salad?"
S06E02,GEORGE,What big salad? I'm going to the coffee shop.
S06E02,ELAINE,They have big salads.
S06E02,GEORGE,I've never seen a big salad.
S06E02,ELAINE,They have a big salad.
S06E02,GEORGE,Is that what I ask for? The BIG salad?
S06E02,ELAINE,"It's okay, you don't"
S06E02,GEORGE,"No, no, Hey I'll get it. What's in the BIG salad?"
S06E02,JERRY,"Big lettuce, big carrots, tomatoes like volleyballs."
S06E02,GEORGE,"(???), we'll see you in a little while."
S06E02,ELAINE,Maybe I should just get married.
S06E02,JERRY,Dating is really starting to get embarrassing isn't it?
S06E02,ELAINE,"I know. You know, whenever I'm on a date I feel people can tell."
S06E02,JERRY,People on dates shouldn't even be allowed out in public.
S06E02,ELAINE,You can say that again.
S06E02,JERRY,"It's embarrassing for them. It's painful for us to watch. I'm going out with someone later, I'm not even taking her out of the house."
S06E02,ELAINE,Good for you.
S06E02,JERRY,I don't need a bunch of people staring at us.
S06E02,ELAINE,Right on baby. (???)
S06E02,JERRY,What was that?
S06E02,KRAMER,"That Gendason, what a jerk. I'm never playing golf with him again."
S06E02,ELAINE,Who Gendason?
S06E02,KRAMER,Steve Gendason.
S06E02,ELAINE,Why is that name familiar?
S06E02,Hx,He used to be a baseball player.
S06E02,ELAINE,"Oh, how did you end up playing golf with him?"
S06E02,KRAMER,"Well, I met him on the course a couple of years ago. Yeah. Played with him a lot. But today was it! We're on the fifteenth hole, ya, he's beating me by a couple of strokes. Then, he's about to hit his second shot, when, he picks up the ball and CLEANS it."
S06E02,ELAINE,So what?
S06E02,KRAMER,"Umph, sorry! But the rules clearly state that you cannot clean the ball unless it's on the green. The rules are very clear about that."
S06E02,JERRY,Certainly are.
S06E02,KRAMER,"Ya, so I penalized him a stroke."
S06E02,KRAMER,He LOST IT! We almost came to blows. We were face to face like a manager and an umpire like this . . kara a pukka ba ya ka ba . . .
S06E02,JERRY,All right. You're in MY face.
S06E02,ELAINE,I still don't see what the big deal is.
S06E02,KRAMER,A rule is a rule. And let's face it. Without rules there's chaos.
S06E02,JULIE,I like Anna Quindlen's column and Safire. Don't you like Safire?
S06E02,GEORGE,"Oh, Safire. Uh ha"
S06E02,JULIE,Although at times can be rather pedantic.
S06E02,GEORGE,He can be pedantic. He can be pedantic.
S06E02,JULIE,And Bob Herbert's great. He's the Daily News.
S06E02,GEORGE,"Yes. Yes. You know what's interesting. The quarterback for the Atlanta Falcons is Bobby Hebert. No ""r"" which I find fascinating. You know it's Herbert h-e-r-b-e-r-t, Hebert h-e-b-e-r-t. ""Hebert"" it's a fun name to pronounce. Try and say it Hebert. Take a shot. All right. (check arrives) All right. I"
S06E02,JULIE,"No, no. I'd like to take you out."
S06E02,GEORGE,"No, Julie, Julie, don't insult me. You know, what difference does it make who pays for lunch. It's totally meaningless."
S06E02,JULIE,"Okay, thanks, George."
S06E02,Wx,Here's your big salad to go.
S06E02,JULIE,"Oh, thank you."
S06E02,JERRY,"(on phone) Hello. No she's not here. Okay, fine, whatever. I'll tell her. Okay. Goodbye. The stationery store guy called to say he ORDERED your pencil."
S06E02,ELAINE,I told ya'. He has ideas.
S06E02,JERRY,He doesn't even care if a man answers.
S06E02,ELAINE,Or you.
S06E02,GEORGE,"Hey, hey."
S06E02,ELAINE,Hey.
S06E02,JULIE,Sorry e're late.
S06E02,ELAINE,No problem.
S06E02,JULIE,Here's your big salad.
S06E02,ELAINE,"Thank you, Julie."
S06E02,JULIE,"Oh, you're very welcome. So, I guess I better get going. Gotta meet mother a t the Guggenheim. Sure you don't want to go?"
S06E02,GEORGE,"No, you go Guggenheim. I'm not much of a Guggenheim."
S06E02,JULIE,"Sure, George."
S06E02,GEORGE,"Ya, you go."
S06E02,JULIE,"Okay, I'll see you later. Goodbye."
S06E02,JERRY,Bye bye
S06E02,GEORGE,Did you see what just happened?
S06E02,JERRY,"Well, that all depends. . ."
S06E02,GEORGE,Did you happen to notice that Julie handed the big salad to Elaine?
S06E02,JERRY,"Yeah, so?"
S06E02,GEORGE,"Well, she didn't BUY the big salad. I bought the big salad."
S06E02,JERRY,Is that a fact?
S06E02,GEORGE,Yes it is. She just took credit for my salad. That's not right.
S06E02,JERRY,No it isn't.
S06E02,GEORGE,I mean I'm the one who bought it.
S06E02,JERRY,Yes you did.
S06E02,GEORGE,You think she should have said something?
S06E02,JERRY,She could have.
S06E02,GEORGE,"Oh, I know."
S06E02,JERRY,"Imagine, her taking credit for your big salad."
S06E02,GEORGE,You know you buy a big salad for somebody it would be nice if they knew it.
S06E02,JERRY,Obviously.
S06E02,KRAMER,Turn on the TV.
S06E02,JERRY,What?
S06E02,KRAMER,I'm puttin it on
S06E02,TV,". . . the district attorney's office and the police department have not answered any questions as yet. To repeat in case you're just joining us. Former baseball start Steve Genderson, has been taken to Police headquarters for questioning the murder of Bobby Pinkus the owner of Royal Dry Cleaners at 2759 Amsterdam Avenue. According to Pinkus' wife, Gendeson had been involved in a dispute with the cleaner about a stain on a pair of gray Sans-A-Belt slacks. We also have a report that earlier in the day a groundskeeper at Vancourtland's Golf Course saw an irate Gendeson leaving the clubhouse in a huff. Whether there is a possible connection between the two is something we'll just have to wait."
S06E02,KRAMER,Jerry . . .
S06E02,JERRY,"Well, it has nothing to do with you."
S06E02,KRAMER,"Yeah, but maybe he was so mad from the penalty stroke that he murdered the dry cleaner."
S06E02,JERRY,"Well, generally speaking you don't need any extra incentive to murder a dry cleaner. I wouldn't worry about that."
S06E02,ELAINE,I like Julie. She's very personable.
S06E02,GEORGE,"Yeah, she's very lovely."
S06E02,ELAINE,That's great George.
S06E02,GEORGE,So did you enjoy your lunch?
S06E02,ELAINE,"Yeah, A big salad. Very good. Actually it was too big. Ha ha ha Wht?"
S06E02,GEORGE,"oh, . . .because she handed you the bag. I could have handed you the bag. She happened to pick it up at the restaurant even though, . . ."
S06E02,ELAINE,Even though what?
S06E02,GEORGE,". . . naw, it's just you thanked HER, and and oh, . . . what's the difference?"
S06E02,ELAINE,"What? What are you trying to say, George?"
S06E02,GEORGE,It's just that I was the one who actually paid for the big salad. She just happened to hand it to you. But it's no big deal.
S06E02,ELAINE,"You want the money for the big salad, George?"
S06E02,GEORGE,"No, no,"
S06E02,ELAINE,What is the problem?
S06E02,GEORGE,There is no problem. . . just a small miscommunication. Whereby you thanked her instead of the person actually responsible for purchasing the big salad.
S06E02,JERRY,And Kramer thinks a penalty stroke may have driven him to it.
S06E02,MARGARET,"Well, they haven't even arrested him yet. Come on, let's go out."
S06E02,JERRY,"Ah, no , I don't think so."
S06E02,MARGARET,Why not?
S06E02,JERRY,We don't need a bunch of people staring at us.
S06E02,MARGARET,Who is staring?
S06E02,JERRY,"Oh, they're staring. They know we're on a date. They're making fun. Come on. It's embarrassing."
S06E02,JERRY,"Hello. No she's not here. Yes I will tell her. No I don't know what time she might be coming back. Look I gotta' go. Goodbye. . . . That, that's a long story."
S06E02,JERRY,Hello Newman.
S06E02,MARGARET,"Hello Jerry, I was wondering if you knew where Kramer was."
S06E02,JERRY,"No, no I don't. Why?"
S06E02,MARGARET,"You know, Genderson. This is something big."
S06E02,JERRY,I suppose.
S06E02,MARGARET,What did Kramer say?
S06E02,JERRY,I don't know. Nothing.?
S06E02,MARGARET,"Come on Jerry. You know something TELL ME! TELL ME!, Oh, chocolates . . . Margaret?"
S06E02,MARGARET,Hello.
S06E02,JERRY,You two know each other?
S06E02,NEWMAN,You might say that.
S06E02,MARGARET,We used to go out.
S06E02,NEWMAN,"Well, tootle loo. And nice seeing you again Margaret, goodbye Jerry. Have fun. Hehe"
S06E02,JERRY,. . . YOU went out with . . . Newman?
S06E02,MARGARET,Just a few times.
S06E02,JERRY,Why?
S06E02,MARGARET,I liked him.
S06E02,JERRY,"You liked, Newman?"
S06E02,MARGARET,Look I'm a little uncomfortable talking about this okay?
S06E02,JERRY,"No, I'm sorry. I'm just a little curious. I mean why did you stop seeing him."
S06E02,MARGARET,He ended it.
S06E02,JERRY,. . . HE ended it?
S06E02,MARGARET,YES!! Yes! It was a couple of years ago. Why does it matter?
S06E02,JERRY,"No, no of course not."
S06E02,KRAMER,"Jerry, Jerry they found a tee."
S06E02,JERRY,What tee?
S06E02,KRAMER,A golf tee. In the dry cleaner.
S06E02,JERRY,Newman! She went out with Newman!
S06E02,ELAINE,It must be a mistake.
S06E02,JERRY,"No. It isn't and the most distressing part of it is, not that she went out with him but that HE stopped seeing her. Do you understand? He, Newman; Newman stopped seeing her. Newman never stopped seeing anybody. Newman will see whoever is willing to see him. Not so much why she did see him as disturbing as that is. But why, did HE, Newman, stop seeing her?"
S06E02,ELAINE,Perhaps there's more to him than meets the eye.
S06E02,JERRY,"No, there's less."
S06E02,ELAINE,It's possible.
S06E02,JERRY,No it isn't. I've looked into his eyes. He's pure evil.
S06E02,ELAINE,"He's an enigma, a mystery wrapped in a riddle."
S06E02,JERRY,"Yeah, he's a mystery wrapped in a Twinkie."
S06E02,Wx,Would you like some more coffee?
S06E02,JERRY,"No,, but thank you."
S06E02,JERRY,"Oh, by the way, your stationery store guy called and he's got your pencil."
S06E02,ELAINE,Ugh! You are kidding me.
S06E02,JERRY,"No, he left the store early, made a special trip to the distributor and got it."
S06E02,ELAINE,I bought mine yesterday on 14th Street.
S06E02,JERRY,"Well, what did you do that for? You ordered it."
S06E02,ELAINE,To please Mr. Pitt.
S06E02,JERRY,"Well, you better go down there and tell this guy. He's very excited."
S06E02,ELAINE,"Uh, great!"
S06E02,JERRY,Hi Julie.
S06E02,JERRY,Hi.
S06E02,ELAINE,Hi Julie.
S06E02,JERRY,"Hi, how are you, Elaine? I'm meeting George here."
S06E02,ELAINE,"Oh, well then I better get going otherwise George will make me buy him lunch to make up for that big salad he bought me yesterday."
S06E02,JERRY,How do you know THAT?
S06E02,NEWMAN,Who is it.
S06E02,JERRY,It's Jerry.
S06E02,NEWMAN,You've come at a bad time now. Could you come back later?
S06E02,JERRY,Come on Newman. OPEN THE DOOR!
S06E02,NEWMAN,Hellooo Jerry. What a rare treat. What brings you down to the east wing?
S06E02,JERRY,"Okay, pudgy, lets stop playing games. What happened with margaret?"
S06E02,NEWMAN,There's no need to get excited. Can't we discuss this like gentlemen?
S06E02,JERRY,"No, we can't. My skin is crawling just being inside your little rat's nest. Now, what happened?"
S06E02,NEWMAN,Do you really want to know what happened? I'll tell you what Happened. She wasn't my type.
S06E02,JERRY,Noit your type?
S06E02,NEWMAN,Not really.
S06E02,JERRY,"Well, how come?"
S06E02,NEWMAN,"Ah, she just didn't do it for me."
S06E02,JERRY,"What, what is wrong with her?"
S06E02,NEWMAN,"Well, h ha ha- if you're happy with her, that's all that matters."
S06E02,JERRY,You don't think she's attractive?
S06E02,NEWMAN,"No. I need a really pretty face. But, Hey, that's me."
S06E02,JERRY,"Okay, Newman, thanks a lot."
S06E02,NEWMAN,Care for some lemonade?
S06E02,JERRY,"No, thank you."
S06E02,NEWMAN,"Drop bye anytime, jerry. Hah, ha ha"
S06E02,KRAMER,"Listen to this, ""If a player cleans his ball during the play of a hole accept on the putting green he shall incur a penalty of one stroke. "" That's a rule, Jerry."
S06E02,JERRY,But it's just a friendly game. Why do you have to be such a stickler?
S06E02,KRAMER,"Because that's the way I weas raised. You know when I was growing up I had to be in bed every night by nine o'clock. And if I wasn't, well I don't have to tell you what happened."
S06E02,JERRY,What are you so worried about this for?
S06E02,KRAMER,You know he talked about Pinkus on the course?
S06E02,JERRY,He did?
S06E02,KRAMER,"Oh yeah, he said he brought a pair of pants into Pinkus' and they came back stained with some kind of dry cleaning fluid. And Pinkus denied responsibility. You see he was very upset with Pinkus."
S06E02,JERRY,So it had nothing to do with you.
S06E02,KRAMER,"Yeah, but maybe I pushed him over the edge."
S06E02,JERRY,"No, I don't think so."
S06E02,KRAMER,"Poor Pinkus, poor little Pinkus."
S06E02,JERRY,"Hey, let me ask you a question. You met margaret. Doo you think Margaret's good looking? Um, she's a natural beauty. Oh, no makeup. I like that."
S06E02,JERRY,"Yeah, and the curls. You like the curls?"
S06E02,KRAMER,"Oh, I love curls."
S06E02,JERRY,"Yeah,, me too."
S06E02,KRAMER,"All right, I'll see you later."
S06E02,JERRY,Where you going?
S06E02,KRAMER,Genderson's.
S06E02,JERRY,You're going to see Genderson?
S06E02,KRAMER,It's weighing on my conscience.
S06E02,GEORGE,"You know, I think I could have played with dolls if their were dolls in the house. It seems like fun to me. It doesn't seem like a gender thing. I think I would like to play with dolls. What's so terrible?"
S06E02,JULIE,"Ha. So, George, I was talking to Elaine before."
S06E02,GEORGE,A ha! We're just friends.
S06E02,JULIE,"Yes, well anyway, she said something that was kind of intriguing."
S06E02,GEORGE,"Oh, share."
S06E02,JULIE,"Well, when I came over to the table she mentioned something about how she better hurry up and leave or you'd make her buy lunch to make up for the one you bought yesterday."
S06E02,GEORGE,"Ha, ha ha uh, I'm not following that."
S06E02,JULIE,"Well, my question is, How could Elaine be under the impression that you bought the big salad, when I was the one who handed it to her?"
S06E02,GEORGE,"Well, she probably just assumed."
S06E02,JULIE,"Um, did she?"
S06E02,GEORGE,". . .uh, . . . wait a second. Are you suggesting that I went out of my way to tell Elaine that even though you handed her the big salad, that it came from me?"
S06E02,JULIE,That's what I'm suggesting.
S06E02,GEORGE,". . . WELL IT WAS A BIG SALAD. AND WHAT I WOULD LIKE TO KNOW IS, HOW DOES A PERSON WHO HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH THE BIG SALAD CLAIM RESPONSIBILITY FOR THAT SALAD AND ACCEPT THE THANK YOU UNDER FALSE PRETENSES - AH - AH?"
S06E02,JULIE,"George, all I did was hand someone a bag."
S06E02,ELAINE,It's just that my boss is very demanding and he needed the pencil right away.
S06E02,STATIONER,"Well,, why did you tell me to order it if you knew you were going to get one someplace else?"
S06E02,ELAINE,"No, no no I didn't know. I, I'm sorry."
S06E02,STATIONER,I went all the way down to the warehouse. It took me three hours. I had a big fight with the foreman.
S06E02,ELAINE,Really? A fight with the foreman?
S06E02,STATIONER,Yes.
S06E02,ELAINE,"Well, again, I'm just awfully sorry."
S06E02,STATIONER,"Yeah? Well, then how about going out with me tonight?"
S06E02,ELAINE,Okay.
S06E02,MARGARET,I mean they found a tee and he played golf that day. Nobody walks into a dry cleaner's with a tee. The circumstantial evidence is overwhelming.
S06E02,JERRY,You had how many dates with him? Three?
S06E02,MARGARET,Around three. I don't know.
S06E02,JERRY,And . .
S06E02,MARGARET,I told you. He stopped calling me. I moved on. I'm not hung up on him. What are you looking at?
S06E02,JERRY,What? I'm not looking. Nothing.
S06E02,JERRY,Why are you looking at my face?
S06E02,JERRY,Where am I going to look?
S06E02,MARGARET,Kiss me.
S06E02,JERRY,. . . I can't.
S06E02,JERRY,Newman!
S06E02,JERRY,All I could think of was when I was looking at her face was; Newman found this unacceptable.
S06E02,ELAINE,"Well, ,I'm going out with the stationery store guy."
S06E02,JERRY,You're going out with the stationery store guy?
S06E02,ELAINE,I felt so guilty about the pencil I couldn't say no.
S06E02,ELAINE,"Well, well, well, I'm not treating you to lunch ANYMORE! You had to tell Julie that I made a special point of telling you that I bought you the big salad. Didn't ya'."
S06E02,ELAINE,"Uh, uh."
S06E02,GEORGE,"You know, if it was a regular salad I wouldn't have said anything. But you had to have the BIG SALAD."
S06E02,JERRY,"Hello, what? You're kidding. I'm turning it on. Oh, my god. Get out of here. (hangs up) Hey listen to this. They issued a warrant for Genderson's arrest. He escaped and the police spotted him on the New Jersey Turnpike."
S06E02,TV,"As you can see white Bronco. The police have cleared the highway traffic in front of him but they are keeping their distance and don't want the situation to escalate. And we have gotten an identification on the driver of the vehicle. His name is; Kramer, one of Genderson's golfing buddies."
S06E02,POLICE,9-1-1 What are you reporting
S06E02,KRAMER,"Yeah, this is Kramer. I got Genderson in the car. He wants to see his fish. I'm taking him to see his fish. So tell the police to back off."
S06E02,POLICE,"Okay, sir, and what's your name?"
S06E02,KRAMER,My name is Kramer. You know who I am dammit!
S06E02,Genderson,I told you not to take the turnpike.
S06E02,KRAMER,I thought we would blend in.
S06E02,Genderson,If we took the palisades this never have happened.
S06E02,KRAMER,we would have had all that bridge traffic.
S06E02,Genderson,"Ah, just drive."
S06E03,ELAINE,She was hitting on you? My friend Noreen?
S06E03,JERRY,"Your friend, Noreen."
S06E03,ELAINE,Are you sure you're not just flattering yourself?
S06E03,JERRY,"If I was flattering myself, I think I'd come up with someone a little less annoying than Noreen."
S06E03,ELAINE,I cannot believe that she was hitting on you.
S06E03,JERRY,"If you don't believe me, ask her."
S06E03,ELAINE,"I will. Besides, she's got a boyfriend, Jerry, you know him. Dan. Remember, we went to that party at his house?"
S06E03,JERRY,"Oh, right. The guy who talks with a really high voice."
S06E03,ELAINE,Yeah.
S06E03,KRAMER,"Jerry, did you get my Fortune magazine in your mail?"
S06E03,JERRY,Check the pile.
S06E03,KRAMER,"(leafing through Jerry's mail) Oh, who sent you a card?"
S06E03,JERRY,I don't know.
S06E03,KRAMER,"Open it, it's from Hallmark."
S06E03,JERRY,Oh.
S06E03,ELAINE,"Hello, darling."
S06E03,JERRY,"Isn't that cute, a 'thank you' card from Kristin."
S06E03,KRAMER,Let me see.
S06E03,ELAINE,Who's Kristin?
S06E03,JERRY,"She works for PBS, I met her when I agreed to do that pledge drive."
S06E03,KRAMER,Did you ask her about me?
S06E03,JERRY,"Yeah, in fact she said that you could be one of those people that sits in the back and answers the phone."
S06E03,KRAMER,"Giddy-up! Alright! So now, how does that work? Now, what, I get a percentage of every pledge I bring in, right?"
S06E03,JERRY,"No, it's not aluminum siding, it's volunteer work. All the money goes to the station."
S06E03,KRAMER,"Okay, yeah, alright, that sounds good, but I still get a tote bag though, right?"
S06E03,JERRY,"Yeah, and one of those foam beer can holders."
S06E03,ELAINE,(dialing the phone) You know what I'm doing? I'm calling Noreen.
S06E03,JERRY,"Oh, go ahead."
S06E03,ELAINE,You sure you don't mind?
S06E03,JERRY,Like she's really going to admit she was flirting with me.
S06E03,HIGH PITCHED VOICE,Hello?
S06E03,ELAINE,"Hi, it's Elaine. Listen, I was just talking to Jerry."
S06E03,HIGH PITCHED VOICE,Jerry?
S06E03,ELAINE,Jerry Seinfeld.
S06E03,HIGH PITCHED VOICE,"Oh, I like Jerry a lot."
S06E03,ELAINE,You mean like like?
S06E03,HIGH PITCHED VOICE,What are you talking about?
S06E03,ELAINE,"Noreen, were you hitting on him?"
S06E03,HIGH PITCHED VOICE,"Noreen's not here, this is Dan."
S06E03,ELAINE,Ooh.
S06E03,DAN,You say that Noreen was hitting on Jerry Seinfeld?
S06E03,ELAINE,Uh oh.
S06E03,JERRY,"So was I right? She likes me, right?"
S06E03,ELAINE,"Oh, I'm sorry Mr. Pitt. Hello?"
S06E03,HIGH PITCHED VOICE,Elaine? What is going on? Why did you tell Dan I was hitting on Jerry Seinfeld?
S06E03,ELAINE,Is this Noreen?
S06E03,HIGH PITCHED VOICE,(Noreen) What would ever possess you to make up a story like that.
S06E03,ELAINE,"Well, listen, Jerry mentioned it, and, I don't know--"
S06E03,ELAINE,"Noreen, are you crying?"
S06E03,DAN,"No, this is Dan!"
S06E03,ELAINE,"Oh, hi Dan."
S06E03,MR. PITT,Elaine? Work?
S06E03,ELAINE,Tell Noreen I'll just call her back later.
S06E03,MR. PITT,Who was crying?
S06E03,ELAINE,"No one. I'm sorry Mr. Pitt, that won't happen again."
S06E03,MR. PITT,"(unwrapping a candy bar, placing it on a plate and cutting it with knife and fork) I'm sure it won't, but someone was crying and I want to know who it was."
S06E03,ELAINE,"Well, it's a long story, okay? But my stupid friend Jerry told my other friend Noreen that she was-- (noticing Mr. Pitt eating the candy bar with knife and fork and becoming distracted) You know, hitting on him and so I called her to see what was, uh, going on and I accidentally got her boyfriend, who is this, you know--"
S06E03,JERRY,"I'm Jerry Seinfeld, I tell jokes for a living, but there's no joking about the financial crisis at PBS. Show us you care. Call in your pledge now."
S06E03,KRISTIN,"Jerry, I am so grateful that you're doing this."
S06E03,JERRY,"Oh, I know you are."
S06E03,KRISTIN,You got the card I sent?
S06E03,JERRY,I did.
S06E03,KRISTIN,So where is it?
S06E03,JERRY,What?
S06E03,KRISTIN,The card. Is this it in the trash?
S06E03,JERRY,No?
S06E03,KRISTIN,"This is my card, you threw it away."
S06E03,JERRY,Well--
S06E03,KRISTIN,I put a lot of thought into this card.
S06E03,JERRY,"You signed your name and you addressed the envelope, it's not like you painted the picture and wrote the poem."
S06E03,KRISTIN,Fine. I gotta get back to the office.
S06E03,JERRY,"Why, because I threw the card out? How long was I supposed to save it?"
S06E03,KRISTIN,You have no sentimentality.
S06E03,JERRY,"I have sentimentality, really, I'm sentimental. Here, look. Here's some cards I've saved, these are birthday cards from my grandmother, see, I'm not a bad guy."
S06E03,KRISTIN,"Oh, so you save her cards but not mine! Oh great!"
S06E03,JERRY,"(as Kristin is storming out) Well, but, you see, I saved something! See? I can save. I'll see you at the pledge drive, ok?"
S06E03,KRAMER,"New cards, huh?"
S06E03,JERRY,"No, they're old cards from my grandmother."
S06E03,KRAMER,"Oh. Well, I'll tell you, a nice greeting card can really lift a person's spirits."
S06E03,JERRY,Yeah.
S06E03,KRAMER,"(opening a card) Oh, a check."
S06E03,JERRY,"Yeah, she puts ten dollars in every card for my birthday, that's why I save them."
S06E03,KRAMER,There's a check in all these? Why don't you cash them?
S06E03,JERRY,"I don't know, it's ten dollars."
S06E03,KRAMER,But you got a whole pile here. 1987?
S06E03,JERRY,Oh so what.
S06E03,KRAMER,"Jerry, your grandmother gave you this gift. She wants you to spend the money, to have the fun that she can't have. Oh, this is tantamount to a slap in the face."
S06E03,JERRY,"Oh, get out of here."
S06E03,KRAMER,"Jerry, a gift not enjoyed is like a flower that doesn't blossom."
S06E03,JERRY,"Alright, alright, I'll cash the checks."
S06E03,KRAMER,Yeah.
S06E03,JERRY,"It was a 'thank you' card from Kristin because I'm doing the PBS drive. I mean, how long am I supposed to keep it?"
S06E03,GEORGE,The rule is a minimum of two days.
S06E03,JERRY,You making that up or do you know what you're talking about?
S06E03,GEORGE,I'm making it up.
S06E03,JERRY,"I mean really, what's the point of saving it? I could see if I had a mantel."
S06E03,GEORGE,"Oh, well, a mantel's a whole different story."
S06E03,JERRY,Absolutely.
S06E03,GEORGE,"If my parents had a mantel, I might be a completely different person."
S06E03,JERRY,"So anyway, she's kind of upset about it so I need you to do me a favor."
S06E03,GEORGE,Let's have it.
S06E03,JERRY,"Well, I'm doing the PBS show, so during the show they're gonna be running the Ken Burns baseball thing. So I thought if I could get a baseball player to come on the show with me..."
S06E03,GEORGE,You want me to ask one of the Yankees.
S06E03,JERRY,Could you?
S06E03,GEORGE,Alright. I'll run it by a few people.
S06E03,JERRY,"Alright, Do your thing, where you lie to everyone."
S06E03,ELAINE,(entering and sitting down) I should never have made that phone call.
S06E03,JERRY,"Hey, did you ever get to talk to Noreen?"
S06E03,ELAINE,"Yes, she's very upset."
S06E03,JERRY,So was I right about the flirting? Was it true?
S06E03,ELAINE,"I don't know, I never asked. She was yelling--"
S06E03,GEORGE,Who was flirting with you?
S06E03,JERRY,"Remember when we were in the bookstore, that woman came up to us?"
S06E03,GEORGE,She wasn't flirting with you.
S06E03,JERRY,"Oh, sure she was; Asked me where the 'humor' section was? Humor? Come on."
S06E03,ELAINE,"Jerry, her brother just had a book of political cartoons published."
S06E03,JERRY,"Alright, so maybe she wasn't flirting with me. So what?"
S06E03,ELAINE,"So, yeah, that's funny. Hey, you wanna hear something weird? Mr. Pitt eats his Snickers bars with a knife and fork."
S06E03,GEORGE,Really?
S06E03,ELAINE,Yeah.
S06E03,JERRY,Why does he do that?
S06E03,GEORGE,He probably doesn't want to get chocolate on his fingers. That's the way these society types eat their candy bars.
S06E03,JERRY,"Oh, you know."
S06E03,GEORGE,"What, you think I eat all my meals with you? (To waitress) Excuse me, sweetheart? I think you may have overcharged us. What is this?"
S06E03,WAITRESS,That's the extra toast. Get it?
S06E03,GEORGE,Got it. (the waitress walks away) Did you just see what happened here?
S06E03,ELAINE,What?
S06E03,GEORGE,Did you see the way she pointed at the check? She gave me the finger.
S06E03,JERRY,That's how waitress types express derision. They don't want to get their mouths dirty.
S06E03,GEORGE,"So, what do you think?"
S06E03,MR. MORGAN,"A PBS fundraiser? I'm not gonna waste any of the players' time with that, besides the team already does so much promotion for channel eleven."
S06E03,GEORGE,"Channel eleven? Forgive me for trying to class up this place, for trying to have the Yankees reach another strata of society that might not watch channel eleven."
S06E03,MR. MORGAN,"Uh, what the hell are you doing?"
S06E03,GEORGE,"I am eating my dessert. How do you eat it, with your hands?"
S06E03,MR. MORGAN,"You know, maybe George has something here about PBS."
S06E03,JERRY,"Okay, sixty bucks from Nana."
S06E03,KRAMER,Huh? Yeah.
S06E03,NANA,Hello?
S06E03,VOICE,"Hello, this is Chemical Bank. Just wanted you to know that your checking account is overdrawn."
S06E03,NANA,Chemical Bank? I haven't used that account in months.
S06E03,VOICE,"Well, someone's been cashing the checks and you're overdrawn."
S06E03,NANA,Oh dear. I'll be down there first thing in the morning.
S06E03,VOICE,"(unheard by Nana as she hangs up the phone) Wait, we can do this over the phone."
S06E03,"(Fade to the next morning, the alarm clock goes off, it's 5","30, Nana turns off the alarm, fully dressed, gathers her coat and purse, sighs, and heads for the door.)"
S06E03,JERRY,You got Danny Tartabull?!
S06E03,GEORGE,"You wanted a Yankee, I got you a Yankee."
S06E03,JERRY,"Boy, you really came through. Kristin's gonna be thrilled."
S06E03,GEORGE,"Hey, the Bull owes me one, I helped him with his swing."
S06E03,KRAMER,So you're bringing Danny Tartabull to the fundraiser tonight.
S06E03,GEORGE,Absolutely. Pending approval of the script.
S06E03,JERRY,Excuse me?
S06E03,GEORGE,"Jerry, I'm Yankee management."
S06E03,KRAMER,"Yeah, I'd like to see the script too."
S06E03,JERRY,You're just answering phones!
S06E03,KRAMER,It would put me at ease.
S06E03,GEORGE,"Hey, when you order from the waitress, get her to point to the menu. I want to see what finger she uses."
S06E03,JERRY,"Uh, say, I wanted a side order of fruit but I didn't see it on the men"
S06E03,WAITRESS,"Oh, you're getting it (pointing to menu with index finger), it comes with your breakfast special."
S06E03,JERRY,Right you are.
S06E03,GEORGE,"I didn't get the special, but I'd also like the fresh fruit too."
S06E03,WAITRESS,(scratching cheek with middle finger) I'll check.
S06E03,GEORGE,"(after waitress walks away) I don't believe it, she did it again!"
S06E03,JERRY,"Oh, she had an itch."
S06E03,GEORGE,She had an itch. She could have used any one of those fingers. That finger was meant for me.
S06E03,JERRY,"By the way, lunch is on me. I just cashed my Nana's birthday checks."
S06E03,STREET TOUGH,"Looking for something, lady?"
S06E03,NANA,Isn't the Chemical Bank on this block?
S06E03,STREET TOUGH,The bank? It burned. It's gone!
S06E03,NANA,Oh dear.
S06E03,JERRY,(answering) Hello?
S06E03,UNCLE LEO,Jerry? Hello.
S06E03,JERRY,Uncle Leo!
S06E03,UNCLE LEO,"Listen, I don't want to alarm you, but your nana is missing."
S06E03,JERRY,Nana's missing?
S06E03,UNCLE LEO,"I came to pick her up for a doctor's appointment, she wasn't here. I called the doctor, nobody knows where she is. She hasn't left the apartment in twenty-five years!"
S06E03,JERRY,"I've been thinking about her, I just cashed some of her checks."
S06E03,KRAMER,"Yeah, that's right. You did."
S06E03,UNCLE LEO,What kind of checks?
S06E03,JERRY,I think Chemical Bank.
S06E03,KRAMER,"Oh, they were Chemical."
S06E03,UNCLE LEO,Chemical?! She hasn't used that account since her branch closed. What are you doing cashing her checks anyway?
S06E03,JERRY,"Well, Kramer thought it would make her happy. (To Kramer) I never should have cashed those checks!"
S06E03,KRAMER,"Hey, I didn't twist your arm."
S06E03,UNCLE LEO,"Your grandmother's on a very fixed income. What, are you broke?"
S06E03,JERRY,"Just call me if you hear anything. (hangs up and faces Kramer) Well? I cashed the checks, the checks bounced and now my Nana's missing!"
S06E03,KRAMER,"Well, don't look at me."
S06E03,JERRY,It's your fault!
S06E03,KRAMER,My fault? Your Nana is missing because she's been passing those bum checks all over town and she finally pissed off the wrong people.
S06E03,NOREEN,"So anyway, it's caused a lot of problems. Dan thinks I'm interested in Jerry, he won't let up."
S06E03,ELAINE,"I'm really sorry, but you can see why I'd make a mistake like that."
S06E03,NOREEN,"No, why?"
S06E03,ELAINE,"Well, you know, because he's a high talker."
S06E03,NOREEN,"He does raise his voice occasionally, but that's normal."
S06E03,ELAINE,"No. No, no, no, not a loud talker, a high talker."
S06E03,NOREEN,Really?
S06E03,ELAINE,You don't think his voice sounds a lot like yours?
S06E03,NOREEN,I never noticed that.
S06E03,ELAINE,"Well, it's no big deal, you know, it's just that he can sound like a woman, you know?"
S06E03,NOREEN,Great. I'm going out with a man who sounds like a woman.
S06E03,ELAINE,"Well, he looks like a man."
S06E03,NOREEN,Yeah.
S06E03,ELAINE,He's bald. I know that's a guy thing.
S06E03,NOREEN,I guess.
S06E03,ELAINE,I know he belches a lot.
S06E03,NOREEN,"Well, that's something. So, Jerry thought I was flirting with him."
S06E03,ELAINE,Yeah.
S06E03,NOREEN,"(cutting into a cookie with a knife and fork) Hm. He's kind of a baritone, isn't he?"
S06E03,ELAINE,What are you doing?
S06E03,NOREEN,I'm eating this cookie.
S06E03,ELAINE,"No, no, no, but why are you using a knife and a fork? Did you just"
S06E03,NOREEN,"No, I've seen people do it. I like it."
S06E03,DANNY TARTABULL,"This isn't gonna take long, is it?"
S06E03,GEORGE,"Oh no, in and out, I made sure of that. And you'll be happy to know I perused the script and it's met with my approval."
S06E03,DANNY TARTABULL,I'm sure it's fine.
S06E03,GEORGE,(swerving) Hey! Watch it! Did you see that guy? He just gave me the finger!
S06E03,DANNY TARTABULL,You sure?
S06E03,GEORGE,"Oh yeah! Middle finger, straight up, at me! At us!"
S06E03,DANNY TARTABULL,What are you doing?
S06E03,GEORGE,I'm following him.
S06E03,Banker,"I'm sorry, the account had insufficient funds. We had to return the"
S06E03,Nana,"Oh dear, that's my grandson. May I call him now and explain?"
S06E03,Banker,"Oh, certainly."
S06E03,ELAINE,And now I think she might really be interested in you. And Dan is
S06E03,JERRY,Would you?
S06E03,Elaine (answering),Hello?
S06E03,Nana,"Hello, I need to speak to Jerry."
S06E03,Elaine (thinking it's Dan),"Oh, it's you. We were just talking about you."
S06E03,Elaine (hanging up),Heh?
S06E03,KRAMER,Any word from Nana?
S06E03,JERRY,No.
S06E03,ELAINE,Nana?
S06E03,JERRY,"Yeah, my grandma's missing."
S06E03,ELAINE,Missing?
S06E03,JERRY,Yeah. I think it might have something to do with those checks.
S06E03,ELAINE,"Um, what does Nana sound like?"
S06E03,JERRY,"Like a grandmother, why?"
S06E03,ELAINE,Well...
S06E03,JERRY,"Oh, you hung up on my Nana?!"
S06E03,ELAINE,"I don't know, maybe."
S06E03,JERRY,You told Nana to drop dead?!
S06E03,ELAINE,It's possible.
S06E03,JERRY,"Yes, it is!"
S06E03,KRAMER,"Alright, alright. Look, Jerry, we gotta get down to PBS, PDQ."
S06E03,JERRY,Alright.
S06E03,GEORGE,No one gives us the finger! We're Yankees!
S06E03,DANNY TARTABULL,Want this last donut?
S06E03,GEORGE,"No, you can have it."
S06E03,KRAMER,"Jerry, where are all the tote bags?"
S06E03,JERRY,I don't know.
S06E03,KRAMER,"Well, I'm not leaving the premises without tote bags. I was promised tote bags and tote bags I shall have."
S06E03,KRISTIN,"Jerry, this man wants to see you."
S06E03,JERRY,Leo?
S06E03,UNCLE LEO,Hello.
S06E03,JERRY,Uncle Leo! What are you doing here?
S06E03,UNCLE LEO,I wanted to tell you that your grandmother is fine.
S06E03,JERRY,Oh.
S06E03,UNCLE LEO,She's had quite a day but she's gonna watch you tonight on the TV.
S06E03,KRISTIN,"Jerry, I'm dying to meet Danny Tartabull. Where is he?"
S06E03,JERRY,He'll be here any second.
S06E03,KRISTIN,You know you guys are both on in five minutes.
S06E03,JERRY,"Yeah, yeah."
S06E03,KRISTIN,(leaving) Okay.
S06E03,UNCLE LEO,"Why didn't you tell me you were a little short? Here. If anybody asks you where you got it, you don't know."
S06E03,JERRY,"No, that's ok, I really don't need any money."
S06E03,UNCLE LEO,What are you talking about?
S06E03,JERRY,Please-
S06E03,UNCLE LEO,I want-
S06E03,JERRY,It's not necessary.
S06E03,UNCLE LEO,"Jerry, would you please take it."
S06E03,JERRY,"I can't, I can't take it."
S06E03,UNCLE LEO,I want you to have it!
S06E03,JERRY,"Uncle Leo, I don't want to have it!"
S06E03,UNCLE LEO,"Jerry, take the money!"
S06E03,JERRY,I don't want it!!
S06E03,HIGH PITCHED VOICE,"Jerry, open up. We need to talk."
S06E03,KRAMER,Who's that?
S06E03,JERRY,You know what? It sounds like the friend of Elaine's that was hitting on me in the book store.
S06E03,KRAMER,"Jerry, I'll take care of it."
S06E03,DAN,Is Jerry in there?
S06E03,KRAMER,"Well, he can't be disturbed now."
S06E03,DAN,Well this situation is driving me crazy. He's all I think about. I can't get him out of my mind.
S06E03,KRAMER,"I'm sorry. I mean, I know what it's like to be in love. Ties you up in knots. And Jerry is a very sexy man."
S06E03,DAN,What?
S06E03,KRAMER,"Look, I'm not judging you. In fact, we here at PBS, we have many programs celebrating your lifestyle. Armistead Maupin's Tales of the City, Gender Bending and Swinging in San Francisco. Before Stonewall about those dark ages when you couldn't come out of the closet, lest you be persecuted because of your, you know."
S06E03,DAN,"No, I don't."
S06E03,KRISTIN,(running up) Are you Danny Tartabull?
S06E03,DAN,"No, I'm not."
S06E03,GEORGE,"I'll take care of this, Danny."
S06E03,GEORGE,Excuse me.
S06E03,MAN,What's the problem?
S06E03,GEORGE,"I believe you cut me off, and then made an obscene gesture."
S06E03,MAN,I did? Where?
S06E03,GEORGE,"Outside of Manhattan, about an hour ago."
S06E03,MAN,Wow! Is that Danny Tartabull?
S06E03,GEORGE,"That's right, of the New York Yankees."
S06E03,MAN,I'd like to shake his hand but I can't.
S06E03,JERRY,"I'm Jerry Seinfeld, I tell jokes for a living, but there's no joking about the financial crisis here at PBS. Our lines are open, so please call the number you see on your screen."
S06E03,JERRY,This is the only time this year we'll be asking for donations. You've been enjoying Ken Burns' Baseball-
S06E03,KRAMER,(answering) PBS pledge drive.
S06E03,NANA,"Hello, I'd like to speak with Jerry."
S06E03,KRAMER,"Oh, you again. Buddy, look, forget about Jerry. It's not gonna happen."
S06E03,NANA,This is his grandmother.
S06E03,KRAMER,"Oh, uh, Nana. Hello."
S06E03,NANA,"Tell Jerry I'm sorry, I'm going to have to write him some new checks."
S06E03,KRAMER,"As long as you've got your checkbook out, how about forking a little over to PBS? You watch the station, don't you? You don't want to be a freeloader."
S06E03,JERRY,"-programs like Ken Burns' Baseball. And if Danny Tartabull were here, I'm sure he'd say, 'That's correct, Jerry.'"
S06E03,KRAMER,Jerry? I have an announcement. Your grandmother is on the line.
S06E03,JERRY,My Nana?
S06E03,KRAMER,"And as we speak, she's generously writing PBS a check for fifteen hundred dollars!"
S06E03,UNCLE LEO,"She can't do that, she's on a very fixed income! Stop the show!!"
S06E03,JERRY,I got another card from Kristin. Not quite as chipper as the first one.
S06E03,ELAINE,Wow. Isn't this little bunny giving you the-
S06E03,JERRY,"Yes, he is."
S06E03,ELAINE,You should show this to Georgie.
S06E03,JERRY,Yeah.
S06E03,WAITRESS,(at the next table) Here's your knife and fork.
S06E03,JERRY,"Look, she's cutting up an Almond Joy."
S06E03,ELAINE,I just don't get it.
S06E03,JERRY,"You know, I saw someone on the street eating M&Ms with a spoon."
S06E03,ELAINE,What is wrong with everybody?
S06E03,JERRY,"(surveying the restaurant) Look, they're doing it. They're all doing it!"
S06E03,ELAINE,(standing up) What is wrong with all you people?! Have you all gone mad?!!
S06E04,"I think the thing I admire most about the Chinese is that they're hanging in there with the chopsticks. Because, if you think about it, you know, they've seen the fork... by now. I'm sure they've seen the spoon, they're going, ""Yeah, yeah, they're OK... We're going to stay with the sticks."" I mean, I don't know how they've missed it","thousands of years ago, Chinese farmer gets up, has his breakfast with the chopsticks, goes out and works all day in the field with a shovel... Hello?... Shovel! Not going out there ploughing 40 acres with a couple of pool cues."
S06E04,JERRY,(feeling face) Good shave today...
S06E04,ELAINE,"(sarcastic) Don't worry, Jerry, I can manage these bags; really I'm fine."
S06E04,JERRY,I'm thinkin' of lettin' my sideburns grow in a little...
S06E04,ELAINE,Can we rest here a second.
S06E04,JERRY,"(pause) Yeah, I guess."
S06E04,JERRY,...So how's Noreen?
S06E04,ELAINE,Mmm! She's got a new boyfriend Paul.
S06E04,JERRY,Already? That was fast... I assume he's not a High Talker...
S06E04,ELAINE,"No, but... he has... The Worst Habit. Whenever he answers the phone, he won't put Noreen right on. Ya have'ta go through, like, ten minutes of chit-chat."
S06E04,JERRY,A Long Talker.
S06E04,ELAINE,"Yeah! And he is so boring! But now, whenever he answers the phone I just hang up."
S06E04,JERRY,(pause) All right; let's move it out.
S06E04,JERRY,"Hey, isn't that George's father?"
S06E04,ELAINE,"Oh, yeah, it is! Shall we say hello?"
S06E04,JERRY,I've never seen him in Manhattan before; it's weird. So out of context.
S06E04,ELAINE,That man he's with is he wearing a cape?
S06E04,JERRY,I believe he is wearing a cape.
S06E04,ELAINE,Why is Mr. Costanza with a man in a cape?
S06E04,JERRY,"Well, it is good cape weather. Cool. Breezy."
S06E04,ELAINE,"Yeah, why a cape? Who wears a cape? Where do you even get a cape?"
S06E04,JERRY,"You're right; it is strange. In fact, let's cross to the other side of the street. Cover me."
S06E04,JERRY,"Just, uh, plop it on the counter there."
S06E04,JERRY,Oh! I got a message. (presses button on answer machine)
S06E04,GEORGE,"(on tape, lifeless) Hey, it's George. I got nothin' to say... (beep)"
S06E04,ELAINE,That sounds urgent...
S06E04,JERRY,"Let me call him back... Hello? Who is this? Donna Chang? Oh, I'm sorry, I must o' dialed the wrong number."
S06E04,ELAINE,Donna Chang?
S06E04,JERRY,(is redialing) I should've talked to her; I love Chinese women.
S06E04,ELAINE,Isn't that a little racist?
S06E04,JERRY,"If I like their race, how can that be racist?... Hellooo??... Oh, is this Donna Chang again?!... Yyy-yes, I am calling George... Oh, the lines are crossed! You're getting his calls. Well, what do you know?!"
S06E04,JERRY,So listen...
S06E04,KRAMER,"Hi. I'm goin' through this stuff like water... (to Jerry) Who you talkin' to? (Jerry waves him away and moves towards the bedroom, still on the phone)"
S06E04,ELAINE,He's on with a Chinese woman.
S06E04,KRAMER,"Oooo, ooooo. You know, I dig Asian women."
S06E04,ELAINE,You got a comfort problem there?
S06E04,KRAMER,"No, I think these Jockeys shrunk."
S06E04,ELAINE,I thought you wore silk underwear.
S06E04,KRAMER,"No, no, n--Well, you know, I wore 'em for about a month but I couldn't stick with it. No, I need the secure packaging of Jockeys. (he's serious. Then he makes a hand gesture of grabbing up) My boys need a house!"
S06E04,ELAINE,"(not charmed) That's nice. Listen, Kramer, you know, if you ever want to have kids you shouldn't wear briefs. Boxers are much better for your sperm count."
S06E04,KRAMER,Sperm count? Well how many ssssperm should I have?
S06E04,ELAINE,A lot!
S06E04,JERRY,I got a date!
S06E04,ELAINE,With the Chinese woman?!
S06E04,JERRY,She knew who I was! She saw me in a club one time! My first date ever with the Pacific Rim. I'm very excited.
S06E04,KRAMER,Jerry. Did ya ever have your sperm count checked?
S06E04,JERRY,"No, why should I? I wear boxers."
S06E04,KRAMER,You ever get a woman pregnant?
S06E04,JERRY,"I'm sorry, Kramer. Those records are permanently sealed..."
S06E04,KRAMER,What would you say if I told you I never impregnated a woman?
S06E04,JERRY,"Really? You never slipped one past the goalie in all these years??... Boy, I'm surprised. You've slept with a lot of women!"
S06E04,KRAMER,"A LOT of 'em! (wild gesture, freaked out) Do you think maybe I'm... Depleted??!!"
S06E04,JERRY,"Well, I'm sure you're not... Totally Depleted."
S06E04,KRAMER,Yeah but what if I am? I'm the last... male Kramer! We're facing extinction!
S06E04,JERRY,So go to a fertility clinic. Have your sperm count checked.
S06E04,KRAMER,"Yeah, but then I'd have to... (glances at Elaine) well, you know... into a cup in the middle of the day??"
S06E04,ELAINE,"What, does that conflict with your regular schedule?"
S06E04,ELAINE,(going to the phone) All right. I'm gonna try Noreen again.
S06E04,JERRY,I am very excited about this date! We're goin' to Hunan Balcony!
S06E04,ELAINE,She's Chinese so you suggest Chinese food?
S06E04,JERRY,She suggested it!
S06E04,ELAINE,I thought Chinese don't eat Chinese...
S06E04,JERRY,She's very assimilated.
S06E04,JERRY,Paul again?
S06E04,ELAINE,(matter of fact) You can't get one ring past him.
S06E04,GEORGE,"Hey, hey, hey! You don't call me back?!"
S06E04,JERRY,I tried! Your line's crossed with a Chinese woman!
S06E04,GEORGE,...Huh?
S06E04,ELAINE,"Hey, George, we saw your father on the street before."
S06E04,GEORGE,"Hmm, what's he doin' in the city today?"
S06E04,GEORGE,You didn't ask him?
S06E04,GEORGE,(suspicious) You didn't say hello?
S06E04,ELAINE,"Well, he was with someone. A man... In a cape."
S06E04,GEORGE,Why was he wearing a cape?
S06E04,GEORGE,Was my father wearing a cape?
S06E04,JERRY,No. Jacket and tie no cape.
S06E04,GEORGE,"Huh... Cape... (turns, distracted, heads slowly towards door) What was a man with a cape doin' with my father?... What was my father doing with a man in a cape?... (opens door) Why a cape? Hmm! (exits)"
S06E04,DOCTOR,The results of your sperm test are in.
S06E04,KRAMER,Oh?
S06E04,DOCTOR,Ummm... Are you planning to start a family?
S06E04,KRAMER,"Yes! I would like to very much!... Well, I'm low, aren't I? I ca--I can feel it!..."
S06E04,DOCTOR,"Yes, I'm afraid you're a little low."
S06E04,KRAMER,"Ohhh, maaan!! It's over! The Kramer name is finished! I'm never goin' to procreate--"
S06E04,DOCTOR,Ah--that's not necessarily true.
S06E04,KRAMER,What
S06E04,DOCTOR,There are measures you can take to improve your fertility.
S06E04,KRAMER,"All right, all right. What. What. You tell me; I'll do anything. Come on, Doc, tell me."
S06E04,DOCTOR,First thing you should wear boxer shorts.
S06E04,KRAMER,All the time?
S06E04,DOCTOR,All the time. Ya have to get off Jockeys right away.
S06E04,KRAMER,"Yeah, but I've always worn Jockeys."
S06E04,ELAINE,"Hi Paul! It's Elaine calling! Yeah, I'm calling from a car phone so I don't really have time to talk. Is, is, uh, Noreen there?!... Oh. She's not?! (hurries to put phone down) Okay, great. Well you can just tell her I called, then, an'-- Well, yes. It has been unseasonably cool lately... Oh, okay, well, look I'm pulling up to the building now. So, I'm gonna... (a little later, Elaine is sitting and looking very bored) Yeah, I took 20% too... Um. Look it uh... (turns hair dryer on and off) Paul. The... car seems to be running out of gas so... I'm gonna... have to get off the phone. (hangs up)"
S06E04,HOSTESS,"Please let me know when the rest of your party has arrived, sir."
S06E04,JERRY,"Yes, I will."
S06E04,GUY,(indicating a cigarette) Do you mind?
S06E04,JERRY,"No, go ahead, I second-hand smoke two packs a day."
S06E04,DONNA,Jerry.
S06E04,JERRY,(pause. Stops tapping his leg) 'scuse me?
S06E04,DONNA,Hi. Sorry I'm late.
S06E04,JERRY,Who are you?
S06E04,DONNA,I'm Donna Chang...
S06E04,JERRY,"(stands, puzzled, it's not sinking in) W-what do you mean?"
S06E04,DONNA,I mean I'm Donna Chang.
S06E04,JERRY,(pause) You're Donna Chang?
S06E04,DONNA,Did you think I was Chinese?...
S06E04,JERRY,"Oh. No. What, you mean because of the ""Chang""?"
S06E04,DONNA,"Actually, the family name wasn't originally Chang."
S06E04,JERRY,I didn't think so.
S06E04,DONNA,"Used to be ""Changstein."""
S06E04,ELAINE,She's not Chinese?
S06E04,JERRY,No. Not Chinese. Not even Asian.
S06E04,ELAINE,So. What is she?
S06E04,JERRY,"Well, she's... like you."
S06E04,ELAINE,"(pause, annoyed) Oh, how disappointed you must have been. (walks to couch, with her cereal)"
S06E04,JERRY,"Well, it's false advertising, see? And the thing is, I think she likes people thinkin' she's Chinese. She suggests Chinese food. She always introduces herself as ""Donna Chang""..."
S06E04,ELAINE,So then why are you seeing her again...
S06E04,JERRY,"Well, she is a woman."
S06E04,ELAINE,"Listen, I spoke to Paul an' Noreen. They might be breakin' up."
S06E04,JERRY,Really? (sits on couch)
S06E04,ELAINE,"Well, maybe."
S06E04,JERRY,"Hey, wouldn't it be funny if Paul an' Noreen broke up because o' you kept hangin' up on him?"
S06E04,ELAINE,(pause) What do you mean?
S06E04,JERRY,"Well, you know if Paul thought it was some guy... hangin' up because he was having an affair with Noreen?"
S06E04,KRAMER,"Here, take my Jockey shorts."
S06E04,ELAINE,Whoa! Whoa!
S06E04,JERRY,"Here, what is that?!!"
S06E04,KRAMER,"Look, you gotta help me. I have to get off Jockey shorts."
S06E04,JERRY,Wha--you have a low sperm count?
S06E04,KRAMER,"Very low! Come on, Jerry. Take 'em."
S06E04,JERRY,Nnnoo--I don't want 'em. (starts backing away as Kramer follows him around the room carrying the underwear)
S06E04,KRAMER,"Jerry, look! You gotta help me! I can't have 'em near me! If I have one pair in my house, I'm gonna wear them!"
S06E04,JERRY,Look! I don't want 'em!
S06E04,KRAMER,"All it takes is one pair! Now, come on! J--"
S06E04,JERRY,I'm not gonna be able to sleep if those are in the house!
S06E04,KRAMER,"Boxers! How do you wear these things!! Look at that--they're baggin' up, they're rising in! An' there's nothing holding me in place! I'm flippin'! I'm floppin'!"
S06E04,KRAMER,What am I gonna do!? Jerry! I'm goin' CRAZY in these things! (leaves)
S06E04,JERRY,"(re the underwear pile) Well, I'm gonna have to move now."
S06E04,FRANK,Ya know what I like about Manhattan? There's no mosquitoes.
S06E04,GEORGE,Plenty of mosquitoes.
S06E04,FRANK,Queens is full of mosquitoes.
S06E04,GEORGE,"So, Dad..."
S06E04,FRANK,"Gnats, too. If I'm not mistaken."
S06E04,GEORGE,(pause) Dad! I heard you were in the city the other day!
S06E04,FRANK,(angry) Your mother has to tell you every move I make?!
S06E04,GEORGE,Jerry and Elaine saw you.
S06E04,FRANK,They didn't say hello?
S06E04,GEORGE,"Well, they were in a rush."
S06E04,FRANK,"They couldn't just say hello?!... Oh, to hell with them."
S06E04,GEORGE,"They, uh... said you were with some guy who was wearing a cape?..."
S06E04,FRANK,"Elaine, I can see, not sayin' hello. She's very--what's the word--uh, supercilious."
S06E04,GEORGE,"So Dad,--"
S06E04,FRANK,(shouting and clapping hands in anger) How could Jerry not say Hello?!!
S06E04,JERRY,Did they uncross the lines yet?
S06E04,DONNA,"No, they can't find the problem. It's really getting ridicurous."
S06E04,JERRY,"(long pause -- did he hear ""ridicurous"" -- should he say something -- can't decide if he should. Finally...) Did you say, ""ridicurous""?"
S06E04,DONNA,Ridiculous.
S06E04,JERRY,"(pause) I thought you said... ""ridicurous."" (Donna looks puzzled)"
S06E04,GEORGE,Hey-- (spots Donna)
S06E04,JERRY,"Oh, what are you doing here?"
S06E04,GEORGE,"Oh, I wanted to talk to you--I'm sorry, I--didn't know you... (re Donna) had company. (Jerry indicates he should stay) Hiya, I'm George."
S06E04,DONNA,Oh! Hi! (they shake hands) I'm Donna Chang. (George to himself registers that as weird. He and Jerry exchange sideways glances) I just spoke to your mother before.
S06E04,GEORGE,You spoke to my mother?
S06E04,DONNA,"She was trying to call you, but--"
S06E04,JERRY,The rines are crossed?
S06E04,GEORGE,"Did you say, ""The rines are crossed?"""
S06E04,JERRY,Did I?
S06E04,DONNA,"(pause) George, she's so sweet. We talked for an hour!"
S06E04,GEORGE,(smile) Yeah.
S06E04,DONNA,"Anyway, I'm really sorry."
S06E04,GEORGE,Sorry? Why sorry? What you got to be sorry about?
S06E04,DONNA,"Well, she told me she and your father are getting divorced."
S06E04,ELAINE,"Ay, divorced. That's really too bad..."
S06E04,JERRY,"Yeah, you know it's a shame his parents didn't get divorced thirty years ago. He could have been normal."
S06E04,GEORGE,Oh my God! (coming out of bathroom) You know what I just realized?! If they get divorced an' live in two separate places? That's twice as many visits!
S06E04,JERRY,"Gee, I never thought of that."
S06E04,GEORGE,Imagine if I had to see them both on the same day? (mirthless) Haha! It's like runnin' a double marathon!
S06E04,ELAINE,"Hey Georgie, did you have any idea that anything was wrong?"
S06E04,JERRY,Have you ever spent any time with these people...?
S06E04,GEORGE,You know what this has to do with?
S06E04,ELAINE,What?
S06E04,GEORGE,The man in the cape--I bet you he is mixed up in this! I don't trust men in capes.
S06E04,JERRY,And you can't cast aspersions on someone just because they're wearin' a cape... Superman wore a cape... An' I'll be damned if I'm gonna stand here an' let you say something bad about him.
S06E04,GEORGE,All right Superman's the exception.
S06E04,KRAMER,"Oh, hey! Elaine, I just heard that Noreen and Paul are breaking up. I want you to put in a good word for me. (to Jerry) I've always had a thing for Noreen."
S06E04,ELAINE,"No, Kramer. You don't understand. This could be my fault."
S06E04,KRAMER,"Well, if she's available now, I'm not gonna let her slip through my fingers this time. Nooope. (does a little dance)"
S06E04,JERRY,Well it looks like you've adjusted to the boxers...
S06E04,KRAMER,"Wellll, I wouldn't go as far as that."
S06E04,JERRY,You went back to the Jockeys?
S06E04,KRAMER,Wrong again.
S06E04,JERRY,"(pause as he realizes) Oh, no."
S06E04,ELAINE,What? What?...
S06E04,JERRY,"Don't you see what's goin' on here???... No boxers, no Jockeys..."
S06E04,ELAINE,(backing away from Kramer) Eeaawww...
S06E04,JERRY,"The only thing between him and us is a thin layer of gabardine... Kramer, say it isn't so."
S06E04,KRAMER,"Oh, it be so. I'm out there, Jerry, an' I'm lllovin' every minute of it!!!"
S06E04,JERRY,Don't you need a little... help?
S06E04,KRAMER,"Surprisingly, no. I'm freee, I'm unfettered... (opens door to leave, still very happy, then) Feel like a naked innocent boy rrroamin' the countryside!! (exits)"
S06E04,ELAINE,So you guys are tryin' to work it out! That's great!...
S06E04,NOREEN,"Yeah, well... We're trying... But he just went insane there for a while..."
S06E04,ELAINE,"Oh, he went insane?..."
S06E04,NOREEN,"Believe it or not, Paul was convinced I was having an affair because somebody kept calling and hanging up whenever he answered! What kind of a sick person calls and hangs up over and over?"
S06E04,ELAINE,"(awkward, increasingly avoiding eye contact) Well. Uh. I don't know about sick. I mean, maybe it was somebody who, didn't wanna talk to whoever was answering because whoever was answering was always making boring chit-chat, an' was completely oblivious to the fact that the person who was calling, didn't want to speak to them, ah!"
S06E04,NOREEN,(has been growing increasingly slackjawed in amazement) I can't believe that was you...
S06E04,ELAINE,"(looks at Noreen) I'm really sorry, Noreen..."
S06E04,NOREEN,(reconsidering Paul's worth) ...So you thought he was boring?
S06E04,ELAINE,"Hey, Noreen, don't go by me! Ha ha."
S06E04,JERRY,What are you doin' to this woman?! This is the second relationship you've ruined for her in a few weeks!!
S06E04,ELAINE,(head in arms) I know--
S06E04,JERRY,First you ruin her relationship with the High Talker.
S06E04,ELAINE,"Well... I got confused, they sound exactly the same."
S06E04,JERRY,"So she breaks up with him. Somehow picks up the pieces of her life. Miraculously meets... A New Guy! Ya bust that up! An' then, just as they're reconciling, you announce to the world He's Boring."
S06E04,ELAINE,(apologetically) I didn't know she'd take it so seriously.
S06E04,JERRY,"Well, apparently you have a tremendous influence over this woman anything you say she does!"
S06E04,JERRY,Yeah.
S06E04,DONNA,It's Donna Chang.
S06E04,JERRY,(hits button) Come on up. (opens door a little)
S06E04,ELAINE,"Well, I guess I just didn't realize it..."
S06E04,JERRY,"Well, let's look back at your history with this woman. Okay?"
S06E04,ELAINE,(like a little girl) Okay...
S06E04,JERRY,"First, you encouraged her to join the army... She did."
S06E04,ELAINE,She was lost...
S06E04,JERRY,"Then, you suggest she goes... AWOL! She did!"
S06E04,ELAINE,"Well, she didn't seem to be havin' so much fun..."
S06E04,JERRY,You know... You better make sure and never tell this woman to jump off the Brooklyn Bridge...
S06E04,ELAINE,"If I have this much influence over her, why don't I just call her an' tell her to get back together with him--that's aalll!"
S06E04,DONNA,Hi.
S06E04,JERRY,"Oh, Miss Changstein! This is Elaine..."
S06E04,(At the same time--DONNA,Helllo...--ELAINE Hi! How are you?)
S06E04,DONNA,"(to Jerry) Guess what? Mrs. Costanza called me, they're not getting divorced."
S06E04,ELAINE,(happy gasp) Oh.
S06E04,JERRY,Why? What happened?
S06E04,DONNA,"Well, she was trying to call George last night, she got me, we spoke for an hour and she changed her mind!!!"
S06E04,JERRY,Wow! That's amazing!
S06E04,DONNA,"Anyway, she wants to meet me! She invited me over for dinner!"
S06E04,ELAINE,(off camera) Huh.
S06E04,DONNA,She said you should come too.
S06E04,JERRY,Tonight?
S06E04,DONNA,"Yeah--I just remembered, I'm gonna have to cancel my acupuncture class. (goes to phone)"
S06E04,GEORGE,"All right. (tearing his jacket off) Let me just say one thing there is no way that this is gonna happen. You hear me? No Way! Because if you think I'm going' to two Thanksgivings, you're out of your mind!!!"
S06E04,ESTELLE,(calmly) We're not getting divorced.
S06E04,FRANK,Your mother changed her mind... (tries to catch a fly with his hand)
S06E04,GEORGE,"(gleeful, to Estelle) You did?! That's Goood! That's very good! I'm very glad to hear that."
S06E04,FRANK,"Yeah, we worked it out."
S06E04,GEORGE,All right. So let me ask you a question. Who was the man in the cape?
S06E04,FRANK,He was my lawyer.
S06E04,GEORGE,Your lawyer wears a cape...?
S06E04,FRANK,Yeah. So what?
S06E04,GEORGE,Who wears a cape?
S06E04,FRANK,He's very independent; he doesn't follow the trends.
S06E04,ESTELLE,He looks ridiculous in that thing...
S06E04,FRANK,(shouting) You have no eye for fashion!!!
S06E04,ESTELLE,(shouting) I have no eye for fashion?!?!?!
S06E04,GEORGE,All right! Come on! Let's not fight.
S06E04,Frank and ESTELLE,All right! All right!
S06E04,ESTELLE,Georgie's right. (pats him on the cheek)
S06E04,GEORGE,(quietly) ehh. (pausing to look at both of them) So what made you change your mind?
S06E04,ESTELLE,It was that Chinese woman.
S06E04,JERRY,So I'm curious. What'd you tell Mrs. Costanza that changed her mind?
S06E04,DONNA,I mentioned a few bits of wisdom from Confucius.
S06E04,JERRY,"Confucius, huh?"
S06E04,DONNA,Yeah.
S06E04,JERRY,"(pause) You know, you're not Chinese..."
S06E04,JERRY,Hey! I heard the good news!
S06E04,FRANK,"Jerry, how come you didn't say hello to me the other day, huh?!"
S06E04,JERRY,Elaine was... in a rush.
S06E04,FRANK,"(to George, pointing) I knew it was Elaine!!"
S06E04,DONNA,You must be Estelle.
S06E04,ESTELLE,(giggles) Yes. Who are you...?
S06E04,DONNA,I'm Donna Chang!
S06E04,ESTELLE,"(steps back, appalled) You're not Chinese!"
S06E04,KRAMER,Y'ello?
S06E04,ELAINE,Paul?
S06E04,KRAMER,Elaine!
S06E04,ELAINE,Kramer?
S06E04,KRAMER,(pause) YEAHH!
S06E04,ELAINE,What are you doin' there?
S06E04,KRAMER,"Wellll, isn't it obvious?"
S06E04,ELAINE,"(scoffs) Uh, is Noreen there?"
S06E04,KRAMER,Yes she is...
S06E04,ELAINE,(pause) Well... Can I talk to her?
S06E04,KRAMER,"Oh, what? Am I... tooo boring for you?"
S06E04,ELAINE,(losing patience) Alright--would you just put her on?
S06E04,KRAMER,"Well, I feel that it would be best that you didn't talk to Noreen for a while..."
S06E04,ELAINE,YOU feel?
S06E04,KRAMER,"That's right! She an' I have had a very long talk. An' I was appalled to learn of the destructive influence you've had over her life, lo these many years..."
S06E04,ELAINE,"What, are you insane?!"
S06E04,KRAMER,"From now on, I'll be calling the shots around here..."
S06E04,ELAINE,Uh! Ho-ho. An' what are YOU gonna tell her?
S06E04,KRAMER,Well. I've encouraged her to go back into the Army...(Noreen sighs a little) There she'll get the structure an' the discipline she needs right now... And she'll have qualified officers telling her what to do...
S06E04,ELAINE,(sighs) Kramer! You have GOT to let me talk to her!
S06E04,KRAMER,"Can't help ya, kid."
S06E04,ELAINE,Get the-- (Kramer puts phone down)
S06E04,ESTELLE,You're not Chinese!?!?
S06E04,DONNA,...No.
S06E04,ESTELLE,I thought you were Chinese!!
S06E04,DONNA,I'm from Long Island.
S06E04,ESTELLE,Long Island?!?! I thought I was gettin' advice from a Chinese woman!!
S06E04,DONNA,I'm sorry...?
S06E04,ESTELLE,Well... then... that changes everything!
S06E04,GEORGE,What?!
S06E04,ESTELLE,She's not Chinese; I was duped!!
S06E04,GEORGE,So what?! She still gave you advice; what's the difference if she's not Chinese?!?!
S06E04,ESTELLE,I'm not taking advice from some girl from Long Island!! (goes into another room)
S06E04,GEORGE,(chases after her) Wait a minute! You're--now you're getting a divorce because she's from Long Island?!?!
S06E04,FRANK,(shouts after them) You want a divorce?!!? You got one!!!
S06E04,JERRY,"(pause, to Donna) You know, you might wanna think about changin' your name..."
S06E04,ELAINE,"So, ever since she started dating Kramer, she won't even talk to me!"
S06E04,JERRY,Well--Noreen listened to you like George's mother listened to the Chinese. (buys a newspaper out of a machine)
S06E04,ELAINE,"(pause) You know, everybody listens to the Chinese. I mean, look at the fortune cookie. You couldn't get away with that in any other restaurant."
S06E04,ELAINE,"(quietly) hu_uh, (pause) You know, everybody listens to the Chinese. I mean, look at the fortune cookie. You couldn't get away with that in any other restaurant."
S06E04,JERRY,"Yeah, no one's reading any rolled-up messages in a knish..."
S06E04,GEORGE,"Oh, it had to happen!!"
S06E04,JERRY,Hey.
S06E04,GEORGE,"I knew it!! (shuts cab door) I predicted it! (hits cab roof twice, it drives off) Saw both of them today! What a disaster! I'm runnin' all over Queens. First I saw my mother. We had lunch together. Never had... LUNCH with my mother before--it's like a date! Then we drive down to Kew Gardens! Tons of traffic! I see my father. We played ""Clue""! All day with this! [Kew Gardens (see links at end of script)]"
S06E04,KRAMER,"(triumphant) Hey, Jerry! Guess what! The Kramer name might live on! Noreen's late! She's laaate!! (give two thumbs up)"
S06E04,NOREEN,(surprised) Who are you?!
S06E04,MAN,I'm Frank Costanza's lawyer. (He starts pulling her to safety)
S06E05,JERRY,"So, she got you to join a book club?"
S06E05,GEORGE,I got a feeling I'm gonna be much smarter than you pretty soon.
S06E05,JERRY,"Well, I think that statement alone reflects your burgeoning intelligence. (Sits on a couch.) Hey, what about this one?"
S06E05,GEORGE,"Nah, I don't like that one."
S06E05,JERRY,"So, what's your first book?"
S06E05,GEORGE,"""Breakfast At Tiffany's."" 90 pages. (Waves a hand like it's nothing.)"
S06E05,JERRY,"It's kinda old, isn't it?"
S06E05,GEORGE,They wanted to read a Truman Capote book.
S06E05,JERRY (standing),"Oh, sure...Truman Capote."
S06E05,GEORGE,He's a great writer.
S06E05,JERRY,"Oh, yeah."
S06E05,GEORGE,Did you ever read anything by him?
S06E05,JERRY,No. You?
S06E05,GEORGE,Nah.
S06E05,JERRY (sees a white couch by the wall),"Oh, what about this one? Look at this, this is it! This is what I'm looking for. (Sits on the couch.) Oh, yeah!"
S06E05,ELAINE,"Hey, what's going on?"
S06E05,JERRY,"New couch, baby!"
S06E05,ELAINE,New couch? Why?
S06E05,JERRY,"I love this couch. You know what the best part about it is? It doesn't fold out, so no one can sleep over."
S06E05,"ELAINE (to Carl, flirtatiously)",Hello.
S06E05,CARL,Hello.
S06E05,ELAINE,"Oh, let me get the door for you. (They carry the couch out the door.) Ooh, be careful!"
S06E05,JERRY,"Wait till you see it, it's perfect. The guy told me it's one of a kind, they stopped making it."
S06E05,ELAINE,What are you doing with your old couch?
S06E05,JERRY,"Nothing, the moving guys are taking it. Why, you want it?"
S06E05,ELAINE,"Yeah, I'll take it."
S06E05,JERRY,"Well, I'm sure that they can deliver it to your apartment."
S06E05,ELAINE,"Yes, they can. (Kramer enters.)"
S06E05,KRAMER,Hey! Couch is comin.'
S06E05,JERRY,It's here!
S06E05,KRAMER,"Alright! Yeah. You know, I'm excited about this, Jerry. In a way, I feel like I'm getting a new couch."
S06E05,JERRY (nonplussed),Yeah. So do I.
S06E05,KRAMER,Ooh! Remember Poppie?
S06E05,JERRY,"Oh, you mean from Poppie's Restaurant?"
S06E05,KRAMER,"Yeah, yeah. Anyway, uh...we're going into business together. Remember that idea I had a few years ago about the pizza place where you make your own pizza?"
S06E05,JERRY,Yeah.
S06E05,ELAINE,What was that again?
S06E05,KRAMER,"It's a pizza place where you make your own pie! We give you the dough, the sauce, the cheese...you pound it, slap it, you flip it up into the air...you put your toppings on and you slide it into the oven! Sounds good, huh?"
S06E05,ELAINE (in a southern accent),"Ooh, I can't wait to get me a fella and make mah own pie!"
S06E05,JERRY,What made you resurrect that old idea?
S06E05,KRAMER,"Well, I happened to be eating at Poppie's when I told him the ""old"" idea, and his eyes - waaaaaah! - just lit up. You know, he wants to back it."
S06E05,ELAINE,"I heard Poppie's was good, let's go."
S06E05,JERRY,I'm not goin' there. Didn't he get busted by the Board of Health?
S06E05,KRAMER,"That was in the past, Jerry. As it happens, New York Magazine just judged his kitchen to be one of the cleanest in the city. They got a duck there, you think you died and went to heaven."
S06E05,ELAINE,"Ooh! I love duck. C'mon, c'mon!"
S06E05,KRAMER,"Yeah, but you gotta order it two days in advance. (To Jerry) You know, I'm gonna call him, I'm gonna order the duck for you."
S06E05,JERRY,"Oh, Kramer, I -"
S06E05,JERRY,"Right there, guys. That's perfect. Ah? Whatta ya think, Lainie?"
S06E05,ELAINE,"Well, I don't know. I'll have to sit on it."
S06E05,JERRY,"Oh no, I don't want anyone sitting on it."
S06E05,CARL (hands Jerry an invoice),Sign here.
S06E05,ELAINE (to Carl),"Excuse me, I was wondering if would it be possible if you could deliver the old couch to my apartment? It's not very far."
S06E05,CARL,Sure.
S06E05,ELAINE,"'Kay. You, uh...you got room in the truck for me?"
S06E05,CARL,"Yeah, I think we can squeeze you in."
S06E05,ELAINE,"Oh, goody. Okay, well uh...(to Jerry and Kramer)...I'll see you chumps later. (Elaine and Carl exit.)"
S06E05,KRAMER,Did you offer those guys a drink?
S06E05,JERRY,"Uh, no. Should I have?"
S06E05,KRAMER,What kind of a person are you?
S06E05,JERRY,I don't know.
S06E05,GEORGE,"Okay. ""Breakfast At Tiffany's."" (Begins to read, but gradually his attention is drawn to the TV Guide on the end table. George realizes there's a show on he wants to see by looking at his watch, and doesn't start the book.)"
S06E05,ELAINE,"So, he puts the couch down, and just as he's about to leave he says, ""Do you date moving men?"""
S06E05,JERRY,Ah ha...
S06E05,ELAINE,You wanna know what I said?
S06E05,JERRY,I can't wait.
S06E05,ELAINE,"""I do now."""
S06E05,JERRY,Clever.
S06E05,ELAINE,Is that something?
S06E05,JERRY,Yes.
S06E05,ELAINE,Is that something?
S06E05,JERRY,"You're something. So anyway, when they were in my house before, I didn't offer them anything to drink."
S06E05,ELAINE,"Well, they're real men, Jerry. They get sweaty."
S06E05,JERRY,"So, anyone sweaty comes into your house has to be offered a drink?"
S06E05,ELAINE,Yes.
S06E05,JERRY,"Well, would you apologize for me? (Elaine nods. Poppie comes out of the kitchen.)"
S06E05,POPPIE,"Hello! Jerry, so good to see you again! (Puts his hand out.)"
S06E05,JERRY (clearly creeped out by having to shake Poppie's hand),"Hello, Poppie. This is Elaine."
S06E05,ELAINE,"Nice to meet you, Poppie."
S06E05,POPPIE,Let me show you to your table. (Leads Jerry and Elaine to the table.) Your duck is cooking as we speak. It is so succulent...so succulent!
S06E05,JERRY,"Well, Kramer told us all about your business venture together."
S06E05,POPPIE,"Your friend and I are going to make a lot of money. Of course, I already have a lot of money. Poppie does very well...very well."
S06E05,ELAINE,"Well, your mother must be very proud of you."
S06E05,POPPIE,"My mother...was taken from my house by the Communists in the middle of the night when I was ten years old. She was sent to a slave labor camp, where she labored for twelve years. Finally, they released her and she was on a boat to America to re-unite with us...but she was served some bad fish, and she died...on the high seas."
S06E05,JERRY,"So, what's good tonight?"
S06E05,ELAINE,"Boy, I'm really looking forward to this duck. I've never had food ordered in advance before."
S06E05,JERRY,"Ah, I could've stayed home and ordered a pizza from Paccino's."
S06E05,ELAINE,Paccino's? Oh no. You should never order pizza from Paccino's.
S06E05,JERRY,Why not?
S06E05,ELAINE,"Because, the owner contributes a lot of money to those fanatical, anti-abortion groups."
S06E05,JERRY,"So, you won't eat the pizza?"
S06E05,ELAINE,No way.
S06E05,JERRY,Really.
S06E05,ELAINE,Yeah.
S06E05,JERRY,"Well, what if Poppie felt the same way?"
S06E05,ELAINE,"Well, I guess I wouldn't eat here, then."
S06E05,JERRY,Really!
S06E05,ELAINE,Yeah. That's right.
S06E05,JERRY,"Well, perhaps we should inquire. Poppie! Oh, Poppie. Could I have a word? (Poppie comes over.)"
S06E05,POPPIE,"Yes, Jerry. I just checked your duck...it is more succulent than even I had hoped."
S06E05,JERRY,"Poppie, I was just curious...where do you stand on the abortion issue?"
S06E05,POPPIE,"When my mother was abducted by the Communists, she was with child..."
S06E05,JERRY,"Oh, boy."
S06E05,POPPIE,"...but the Communists, they put an end to that! So, on this issue there is no debate! And no intelligent person can think differently."
S06E05,ELAINE (offended),Well...Poppie. I think differently.
S06E05,POPPIE,And what gives you the right to do that?
S06E05,ELAINE (standing up),"The Supreme Court gives me the right to do that! Let's go Jerry, c'mon."
S06E05,WOMAN AT NEXT TABLE (to her date),"I heard that. Let's go, Henry."
S06E05,HENRY,But we just got here...
S06E05,WOMAN AT ANOTHER TABLE,"I'm with you, Poppie!"
S06E05,WOMAN AT YET ANOTHER TABLE (to her date),Let's go!
S06E05,ELAINE (to Poppie),And I am not coming back!
S06E05,POPPIE,You're not welcome!
S06E05,JERRY,"Well, I'm certainly glad I brought it up. (Gets up and leaves.)"
S06E05,JERRY,"Well, you should have seen it. It was quite a scene over there."
S06E05,GEORGE,I'm sorry I missed it.
S06E05,JERRY,"Oh, you really missed something. And I have to say...it was pretty much all my fault. (Jerry smiles. George laughs.) So, how's the book coming? (George's laughs taper off...) I say, how's the book comin'?"
S06E05,GEORGE,Oh...pretty good.
S06E05,JERRY,"So, what's it about?"
S06E05,GEORGE,"Well, it's about Holly Go-Lightly."
S06E05,JERRY,Holly Go-Lightly.
S06E05,GEORGE,"Yeah, she's quite a character."
S06E05,JERRY,"Yes, you haven't read a page, have you?"
S06E05,GEORGE,No.
S06E05,JERRY,Big surprise.
S06E05,GEORGE,"I couldn't. You know, if it's not about sports, I find it very hard to concentrate."
S06E05,JERRY,"You're not very bright, are you?"
S06E05,GEORGE,"No, I'm not. I would like to be, but I'm not. What am I gonna do? The book club meets in a few days."
S06E05,JERRY,Why don't you rent the movie?
S06E05,GEORGE,"'Why don't I rent the movie.' See, this is when I like you. Alright, now I'm relieved. (Kramer enters and comes over to the booth.)"
S06E05,KRAMER (scanning a menu),So...how was the dinner last night?
S06E05,JERRY,Oh...well...
S06E05,KRAMER,"Did you enjoy the duck? (Elaine comes back from the bathroom.) Oh, Elaine! I was just asking how dinner went last night."
S06E05,ELAINE (sitting down),Oh...well...
S06E05,KRAMER,"Alright, what did you do to Poppie?"
S06E05,ELAINE,Nothing.
S06E05,KRAMER,"Well, he's in the hospital. And the cook says you put him there."
S06E05,ELAINE,What's wrong with him?
S06E05,KRAMER,"I don't know! I'm gonna go and visit him later. (angrily) It would be nice if you got him something. (Punches the the table to accentuate this, and leaves.)"
S06E05,JERRY,We should get him something.
S06E05,ELAINE,Yeah. You're right.
S06E05,ELAINE,"Do you know that I have been using the same bottle of shampoo for a year? And I shampoo every day. (Carl smiles.) So, what do you think of my conversation?"
S06E05,CARL,"Not much! (They both laugh.) I, uh, would have invited you up, but I don't have any furniture."
S06E05,ELAINE,You don't have any furniture?
S06E05,CARL,"No, I hate furniture. I can't look at it. (They laugh again.)"
S06E05,ELAINE,"Well, I can understand that. Pretty good date, huh?"
S06E05,CARL,"Yeah! No heavy lifting. (Elaine and Carl look into each others eyes, then kiss.)"
S06E05,KRAMER,"Anyway, Jerry and Elaine felt very badly about what happened to you, and they wanted you to have this."
S06E05,POPPIE (opening the gift basket),What's this? A bottle of wine and a five-alarm chili? They're trying to kill Poppie?!
S06E05,KRAMER,"Why, what...?"
S06E05,POPPIE,"Don't they know I have a gastro-intestinal disorder? If I would have any of this, I would die. Then Poppie's no good to anyone! This is a sick, sick joke on Poppie. How could you be friends with those two?"
S06E05,KRAMER,"Well, we're not very close."
S06E05,POPPIE,They owe me for those ducks. They were flown in from Newfoundland.
S06E05,KRAMER,"Oh, they got good ducks there, huh?"
S06E05,POPPIE,"Oh, very good ducks."
S06E05,ELAINE,I'm in looove!
S06E05,JERRY,Whoa!
S06E05,ELAINE,"This is it, Jerry! This is it! He is such an incredible person! He's real, he's honest, he's unpretentious...oh, I'm really lucky!"
S06E05,JERRY,Did you tell him I was sorry I didn't offer him the drink?
S06E05,ELAINE,"No, I forgot. And, the best part is, he doesn't play games. You know? There are no games! (Sits down on the couch.)"
S06E05,JERRY,No games? What is the point of dating without games? How do you know if you're winning or losing?
S06E05,ELAINE (putting on lipstick),"Well, all I know is, he doesn't like games and he doesn't play games, you know? He has too much character and integrity."
S06E05,JERRY,Ah ha. And what is his stand on abortion?
S06E05,ELAINE (looks at Jerry and smears lipstick across her face),What?
S06E05,JERRY,What is his stand...on abortion?
S06E05,ELAINE,"Well, I'm sure he's pro-choice."
S06E05,JERRY,How do you know?
S06E05,ELAINE,"Because he, well...he's just so good-looking."
S06E05,JERRY,"Well, you should probably ask, because if he's gonna be coming over with those Paccino's pizzas...could be trouble."
S06E05,GEORGE,I'd like to rent Breakfast At Tiffany's.
S06E05,CLERK (checking the computer),"Uh, this is out. Someone has it."
S06E05,GEORGE,"Out? Oh no, I've been to four other places, you're the only ones that have had it."
S06E05,CLERK,"Well, I could put it on reserve for you, if you'd like."
S06E05,GEORGE,Maybe we could call them and ask them to return it.
S06E05,CLERK,"Oh, sorry. We can't do that."
S06E05,GEORGE,"Well, maybe they're done with it. I could go pick it up."
S06E05,CLERK,I don't think so. It doesn't work that way.
S06E05,VOICE ON INTERCOM,Yes?
S06E05,GEORGE,"Uh, excuse me, are you Joe Temple?"
S06E05,INTERCOM,Yes.
S06E05,GEORGE,"Uh, yes, uh...you don't know me, my name is George Costanza...did you happen to rent Breakfast At Tiffany's?"
S06E05,KRAMER,Hey.
S06E05,JERRY,"Hey, what's happenin.'"
S06E05,KRAMER,"Well, you know, Poppie's over at my place. Tonight's the big night. I'm gonna make the first test pizza at the restaurant."
S06E05,JERRY,You got a regular 'Manhattan Project' going on over there.
S06E05,KRAMER,"Yeah. Anyway, he's about to leave, he wants the duck money. (Poppie enters.)"
S06E05,JERRY,"Okay. Hi, Poppie."
S06E05,POPPIE,Hello.
S06E05,JERRY,"I'm sorry about the gift, I didn't know about your condition."
S06E05,POPPIE,"That's fine. If you just give me my duck money, I'll be on my way."
S06E05,JERRY,Okay. I'll get it. (Goes into the bedroom.)
S06E05,KRAMER,"Why don't you sit down, Poppie? You're still recuperating. (Poppie moves to the sofa and sits down, and exhales a loud sigh of relief.) What, are you tired, Poppie?"
S06E05,POPPIE,No.
S06E05,KRAMER,"Hey, Poppie...you really think people wanna make their own pizza?"
S06E05,POPPIE,"Kramer, did I ever tell you about my mother? My mother -"
S06E05,JERRY (comes out of the bedroom with Poppie's money),"Here you go. (Poppie stands up and takes the money.) Anyway, I'm sorry again about the...(notices a large, wet stain on his couch)...the...the..."
S06E05,POPPIE,"The what? (Looks at Kramer, and exits.)"
S06E05,JERRY,...the...the...
S06E05,KRAMER (to Poppie),So long. I'll see you tonight.
S06E05,JERRY (frantic),"Kramer, Kramer, what is this?!"
S06E05,KRAMER,What is what?
S06E05,JERRY,This puddle on my sofa!
S06E05,KRAMER,What puddle?
S06E05,JERRY (points),That puddle! (Kramer sees the puddle and does a double-take.)
S06E05,KRAMER,I don't know.
S06E05,JERRY (looking at the puddle with Kramer),Is it...? Could it...? Could he have...? IT IS! (Grabs Kramer.) Poppie peed on my sofa!!
S06E05,KRAMER,Are you sure?
S06E05,JERRY,"Well, what is it then?! My new sofa! Poppie peed on my new sofa!"
S06E05,KRAMER,I'm sure it'll come out.
S06E05,JERRY,"I don't care if it comes out, I can't sit on that anymore!"
S06E05,KRAMER,"Ah, you're making too much of it."
S06E05,JERRY (sarcastic),"Yeah, you're right. It's just a natural human function...happens to be on my sofa, instead of in the toilet, where it would normally be."
S06E05,KRAMER,Right!
S06E05,GEORGE,"Well, anyway, the book club meets tomorrow, Mr. Temple."
S06E05,JOE,"Well, I was going to watch it with my daughter. She likes Audrey Hepburn very much."
S06E05,GEORGE,She was a delicate flower.
S06E05,JOE,Why didn't you just read the book?
S06E05,GEORGE,"Well, as I say, the pink-eye made my vision...quite blurry... (Joe's daughter comes to the door.)"
S06E05,JOE,"Remy, this is George. Would you mind if he watched Breakfast At Tiffany's with us? (George smiles at Remy. Remy looks at Joe doubtfully.)"
S06E05,CARL,Hi.
S06E05,ELAINE,Hi. (They kiss.)
S06E05,CARL,I missed you.
S06E05,ELAINE,"Oh, I missed you!"
S06E05,CARL,I don't remember the last time I felt this way.
S06E05,ELAINE,"Me, either!"
S06E05,CARL,I think about you all the time.
S06E05,ELAINE,You do?
S06E05,CARL,Do you think about me?
S06E05,ELAINE,"Oh yeah, all the time, all the time...although, recently I've been thinking about this friend of mine."
S06E05,CARL,What friend?
S06E05,ELAINE,"Oh, just this woman...she got impregnated by her troglodytic half-brother, and decided to have an abortion. (Waits in suspense for what Carl's response will be.)"
S06E05,CARL,"You know, someday...we're going to get enough people in the Supreme Court to change that law."
S06E05,GEORGE,"So, anything to uh, nosh?"
S06E05,JOE,What did you want?
S06E05,GEORGE,Popcorn?
S06E05,REMY,Popcorn? Where do you think you are?
S06E05,GEORGE,"Well, a lot of people keep popcorn in the house."
S06E05,REMY,"Well, we don't."
S06E05,GEORGE,"You might want to try it...makes the movie more enjoyable, that's all."
S06E05,JOE (passes George a bowl),Here's some nuts.
S06E05,GEORGE,Oh! Nuts! Excellent! You know what I love? How there's two nuts named after people. Hazel...and filbert.
S06E05,REMY (to Joe),"Can we watch the movie now, Daddy? (Joe presses play on the remote.)"
S06E05,GEORGE,"Hey, let's turn off the lights, get some real 'movie atmosphere.'"
S06E05,JOE,"The lights are fine. (George shrugs, and the movie begins.)"
S06E05,KRAMER (in a chef's hat and apron),"See, anybody can do this. (Tosses pizza dough into the air.)"
S06E05,POPPIE,Use your wrist! It's all in the wrist. (Kramer tosses the dough way up there.) Not too high!
S06E05,KRAMER (puts the dough on the counter),"Alright, put a little sauce on here... (speaks some unintelligible words in an Italian accent while spreading the sauce around.) Some cheese..."
S06E05,POPPIE,Not too much!
S06E05,KRAMER,And...cucumbers! (Grabs a large handful and puts them on the pizza.)
S06E05,POPPIE,Wait a second...what is that?
S06E05,KRAMER,It's cucumbers.
S06E05,POPPIE,"No, no. You can't put cucumbers on a pizza."
S06E05,KRAMER,"Well, why not? I like cucumbers."
S06E05,POPPIE,That's not a pizza. It'll taste terrible.
S06E05,KRAMER,"But that's the idea, you make your own pie."
S06E05,POPPIE,"Yes, but we cannot give the people the right to choose any topping they want! Now on this issue there can be no debate!"
S06E05,KRAMER,What gives you the right to tell me how I would make my pie?
S06E05,POPPIE,Because it's a pizza!
S06E05,KRAMER,It's not a pizza until it comes out of the oven!
S06E05,POPPIE,It's a pizza the moment you put your fists in the dough!
S06E05,KRAMER,"No, it isn't!"
S06E05,POPPIE,"Yes, it is!"
S06E05,JOE'S WIFE,I'm home.
S06E05,JOE,"Hey, honey."
S06E05,REMY,"Hi, Mom."
S06E05,JOE'S WIFE,"Hi, baby. (To George.) Hello. Breakfast At Tiffany's?"
S06E05,JOE,Yeah.
S06E05,JOE'S WIFE,"Well, I just came back from Angela's, it's not looking very good for Duncan."
S06E05,JOE,"Aw, that's too bad."
S06E05,JOE'S WIFE,"Yeah, the doctor thinks it's just a matter of time -"
S06E05,"GEORGE (clears his throat, annoyed that the movie's being interrupted)",Joe...could you...
S06E05,JOE'S WIFE,"Poor guy, I hate to see him suffer like this..."
S06E05,GEORGE,"You know, I'm sorry, I...I hate to be one of those people, but we're right in the middle of this thing...I can't hear."
S06E05,JOE'S WIFE,Who are you?
S06E05,JOE,This is George Costanza.
S06E05,GEORGE (irritated),This is very hard to follow with all the talking.
S06E05,JOE,"I'll pause it, okay? (Pauses the tape with the remote.)"
S06E05,GEORGE,Any more grape juice? (Gets up and goes to the kitchen. Remy moves to the end of the couch where George was sitting.)
S06E05,JOE'S WIFE,Who is this guy?
S06E05,REMY,He's in some book club.
S06E05,JOE'S WIFE,And what's he doing here?
S06E05,REMY,Cheating on his test. (George returns from the kitchen with a glass of grape juice.)
S06E05,GEORGE,"So, we watching the movie, or are we still talking? (Joe's wife shakes her head and goes into the other room. George gestures to Remy to move.) Okay, c'mon. Let's go."
S06E05,REMY,What?
S06E05,GEORGE,"C'mon, you took my seat."
S06E05,REMY,It's not your seat.
S06E05,GEORGE,"I was sitting there, c'mon."
S06E05,REMY,You didn't save it.
S06E05,GEORGE,I had the arm! Joe...
S06E05,JOE,What's the difference?
S06E05,GEORGE,"Well, I was very comfortable! I've got my nuts here..."
S06E05,REMY,It's my couch.
S06E05,GEORGE,"Alright, c'mon, scooch over. (Tries to squeeze into the corner seat of the couch and struggles with Remy. He spills his glass of grape juice all over the couch in the process.)"
S06E05,REMY,"Look! Look what you did! You got grape juice all over our couch, you've ruined our couch! (Joe slowly walks toward George with his hands on his hips.)"
S06E05,GEORGE,Joe...
S06E05,ELAINE,Oh my god.
S06E05,JERRY,You see?!
S06E05,ELAINE,"So, you're gonna get a new couch?"
S06E05,JERRY,"Well, I guess I have no choice."
S06E05,ELAINE,Do you want your old couch back?
S06E05,JERRY,"I was hoping you'd offer. (The intercom buzzes, Jerry answers it.) Yeah?"
S06E05,INTERCOM,It's the movers.
S06E05,JERRY,'Kay. (Buzzes them in.)
S06E05,ELAINE,Who's that?
S06E05,JERRY,"Your boyfriend, he's taking it out."
S06E05,ELAINE,"No, no, he's not my boyfriend."
S06E05,JERRY,Why?
S06E05,ELAINE,Take a guess.
S06E05,JERRY,"Oh, really. (Carl and another moving guy come in and pick up the couch.)"
S06E05,ELAINE,Hi.
S06E05,CARL,Hi.
S06E05,JERRY,"Hey Carl, I also need you to go to Elaine's and bring my old couch back."
S06E05,CARL,Today?
S06E05,JERRY,Could you?
S06E05,CARL,Sure.
S06E05,ELAINE (to Jerry),What are you doing with this couch?
S06E05,JERRY,George is taking it.
S06E05,ELAINE,Did you tell him it was peed on?
S06E05,JERRY,"He said he doesn't care, he'll just turn the cushion over."
S06E05,CARL,"I'm sorry you feel that way, Elaine."
S06E05,ELAINE,"Yeah, me too."
S06E05,CARL,It's just too bad.
S06E05,ELAINE,Yeah. It is.
S06E05,CARL,"Well, I better get this couch back to Jerry's."
S06E05,ELAINE,Can I offer you anything to drink?
S06E05,CARL (off-camera),"Yeah, sure."
S06E05,ELAINE (looking in the fridge),All I've got is grape juice.
S06E05,CARL,Throw it!
S06E05,CARL,The couch!
S06E05,"MARIE (describing Holly Go-Lightly in ""Breakfast At Tiffany's"")","She didn't want the constraints of any relationship, that's why she got rid of the cat. The most important thing in Holly's life was her independence."
S06E05,GEORGE,"Well, not really. After all, she did get together with George Peppard. I mean, Fred."
S06E05,MARIE,George...Fred's gay.
S06E06,JERRY,"I've never been able to figure out why they make these bizarre toilet seats that they have. You know, like those clear Lucite ones, with all the, the coins in it? It's a lovely tribute to our past president, by the way. It's not bad enough Lincoln got shot in the head, we gotta pull down our pants and sit on him, too. It's just incomprehensible that you would buy a thing like this, you install it on your toilet seat, and this says what about you? ""Well, I can't afford to just throw money down the toilet, but look how close I am!"""
S06E06,JERRY,"I cannot believe Lindsay's still seeing you after that ""Breakfast at Tiffany's"" thing."
S06E06,GEORGE,I think she finds my stupidity charming.
S06E06,JERRY,As we all do.
S06E06,GEORGE,"Yeah, anyway, she's uh, having some kind of a family lunch, I'll swing by after."
S06E06,JERRY,"Oh, so you're gonna meet the mother?"
S06E06,GEORGE,"Yeah, I'll zip in, ""How do you do?"", zip out. She'll love me."
S06E06,JERRY,You're good with the mothers.
S06E06,GEORGE,"Y'know, I'm better with the mothers than I am with the daughters."
S06E06,JERRY,Maybe you should date the mothers.
S06E06,GEORGE,"Well, if I could talk to the mothers and have sex with the daughters, then I'd really have something goin'."
S06E06,JERRY,"Oh, you got something goin'."
S06E06,GEORGE,Yeah.
S06E06,KRAMER,(enters apartment) Hey.
S06E06,GEORGE,Hey! (heads toward bathroom)
S06E06,KRAMER,"Hey, you got a hammer?"
S06E06,JERRY,What do you need a hammer for?
S06E06,KRAMER,"Well, I got this new poster. 3-D art? Computers generate 'em."
S06E06,JERRY,"Oh, yeah! I wanna see that. Bring it over."
S06E06,KRAMER,"No, no, I don't have it now. I gotta pick it up at Mr. Pitt's. Elaine was framing a bunch of stuff for him, so she did me a favor. What, you wanna take a ride?"
S06E06,JERRY,"Nah, I don't think so."
S06E06,KRAMER,"(shouting to the bathroom door) George, you wanna go for a ride?"
S06E06,GEORGE,(inside bathroom) Nah.
S06E06,KRAMER,"Oh, COME ON!"
S06E06,JERRY,"Hey, could you wait until the man finishes?"
S06E06,KRAMER,"All right, I've had it with you two. (opens apartment door to leave)"
S06E06,JERRY,"Hey, guess what? Remember that woman you saw me with the other day? You know, she used to be an Olympic gymnast?"
S06E06,KRAMER,A gymnast!
S06E06,JERRY,"Yeah, she's Romanian, she won a silver at the '84 Olympics."
S06E06,KRAMER,"A gymnast, Jerry. Think of the flexibility. Mmm, that sex'll melt your face."
S06E06,JERRY,"Yeah, well, I think I'm bailing."
S06E06,KRAMER,"(shuts door) ""Bailing""?"
S06E06,JERRY,"Yeah, you know, Kramer, there's always a price to pay for just a sexual dalliance."
S06E06,KRAMER,"Jerry, you should pay that price."
S06E06,JERRY,"She's Romanian. What am I gonna talk to her about, Ceausescu?"
S06E06,KRAMER,Ch- oo-... what?
S06E06,GEORGE,"(emerging from bathroom, buttoning his shirt) A gymnast! I can't believe it, you didn't tell me she was a gymnast."
S06E06,JERRY,(watching George buttoning his shirt) What is this?
S06E06,GEORGE,"What, I'm puttin' my shirt back on."
S06E06,JERRY,"(stares at George, incredulous) ""Back on""? What was it doing off?"
S06E06,GEORGE,"I take it off when I go to the, uh, y'know, to the ""office""."
S06E06,JERRY,(laughing) What for?
S06E06,GEORGE,"Well, it frees me up. No encumbrances."
S06E06,JERRY,"Unbuttoned, or all the way off?"
S06E06,GEORGE,"ALL the way, baby!"
S06E06,JERRY,Of course.
S06E06,KRAMER,(convulses in pain) Yeow! Whoa.
S06E06,JERRY,"What, again? Kramer, if you keep getting these attacks, you should see the doctor and have it checked out."
S06E06,KRAMER,"(exiting apartment) Yeah, yeah, yeah..."
S06E06,JERRY,"(picks up newspaper, turns to George) You always take the shirt off?"
S06E06,GEORGE,Always.
S06E06,JERRY,"Boy, I tell ya', knowing you is like going out in the jungle. I never know what I'm going to find next, and I'm real scared."
S06E06,MR. PITT,"Elaine, I need you to proofread this report for my meeting with the Poland Creek Bottled Water people."
S06E06,ELAINE,What meeting?
S06E06,MR. PITT,"I told you. I sit on the Board of Trustees for Morgan Springs, and we're trying to acquire Poland Creek."
S06E06,ELAINE,Oh! (tries to take paper)
S06E06,MR. PITT,(pulls away) Are you using a fountain pen?
S06E06,ELAINE,Yes?
S06E06,MR. PITT,They smear! Under no circumstances is ink to be used in this office.
S06E06,ELAINE,"All right! I'll use a pencil, Mr. Pitt."
S06E06,KRAMER,Elaine?
S06E06,ELAINE,"Come in, come in!"
S06E06,KRAMER,"Yeah. (enters, points at package) Yah, huh?"
S06E06,ELAINE,"Ah, right there, yeah."
S06E06,KRAMER,"(rips open package) Yeah, that's..."
S06E06,ELAINE,"Kramer, it's..."
S06E06,KRAMER,(holds up framed picture) There she blows! (throws paper around)
S06E06,ELAINE,"Kramer, Kramer, can you do this at home? I've got, I've got work to do, okay?"
S06E06,KRAMER,"Oh, these are nice corners, huh?"
S06E06,MR. PITT,"Elaine, did I hear... (sees Kramer) Oh, this is very odd."
S06E06,KRAMER,"(looking at picture) Yeah, it's 3-D art. Computers generate 'em. BIG computers."
S06E06,MR. PITT,"Yes, I've heard about these. How do they work?"
S06E06,KRAMER,"Well, you blur your eyes like you're starin' straight through the picture. And you keep your eyes unfocused. And then... (Kramer and Pitt stare at picture) Oh, oh, oh, YEAH!"
S06E06,MR. PITT,I don't see it.
S06E06,KRAMER,"Yeah, it's a spaceship, surrounded by planets, asteroids..."
S06E06,MR. PITT,I still don't see it.
S06E06,ELAINE,"Okay, Kramer, that's enough. Mr. Pitt has got work to do."
S06E06,KRAMER,Ya' ever dream in 3-D? It's like the boogeyman is comin' right at you.
S06E06,MR. PITT,"A spaceship, where?"
S06E06,KRAMER,"(pointing) Right in here. Just keep your eyes unfocused. (convulses in pain) Waahh! Oh, mama!"
S06E06,ELAINE,"Kramer, what's wrong?"
S06E06,KRAMER,Mama!
S06E06,ELAINE,"Kramer, Kramer, are you okay?"
S06E06,KRAMER,"I think I gotta go to the doctor! (exits) Oh, mama!"
S06E06,MR. PITT,(still staring at picture) How long does it usually take?
S06E06,MRS. ENRIGHT,"Oh, George, it is so nice to finally meet you. And I'm sorry we've kept Lindsay so long."
S06E06,LINDSAY,Mother...
S06E06,GEORGE,"Oh, no, no, not at all. No, I have always felt that the most important thing in the world is spending time with family."
S06E06,MRS. ENRIGHT,Oh? Are you and your family close?
S06E06,GEORGE,"(hesitates) Very close, yes. Almost painfully close."
S06E06,LINDSAY,"Mother, I'm going to walk Nana and Aunt Phyllis to the elevator. George, do you mind waiting just one more minute?"
S06E06,GEORGE,"Mind? Why would I mind? I would love to wait! (shakes hands with Nana) Nana, nice to see you. Ni-ni-ni-ni-NANA! (embraces another guest, kisses her) Aunt Phyllis, always a pleasure. What a pleasure! Hey, let's do this again real soon. I had fun, huh?"
S06E06,MRS. ENRIGHT,Can I offer you anything to eat?
S06E06,GEORGE,"Oh, no no no, I'm fine. Let me help you with these dishes, huh?"
S06E06,MRS. ENRIGHT,"Oh no, George, you don't have to..."
S06E06,GEORGE,"No, I know I don't have to, I want to."
S06E06,MRS. ENRIGHT,"George, you are such a gentleman."
S06E06,GEORGE,"I'd argue if I could, Mrs. Enright. (exits) Here we go, all right."
S06E06,MRS. ENRIGHT,(wide-eyed) Oh...
S06E06,GEORGE,(spits out mouthful of food) Mrs. Enright! Mrs. Enright!
S06E06,ELAINE,"(pointing at 3-D picture) Look, there's a spaceship! That is so cool!"
S06E06,MR. PITT,Where is it?
S06E06,ELAINE,(pointing) Right here.
S06E06,MR. PITT,I'm looking there!
S06E06,ELAINE,"No, no, unfocus."
S06E06,MR. PITT,I am unfocused!
S06E06,ELAINE,"(answering phone) Hello? Oh, yeah, okay fine. Uh, he'll be right down. (to Pitt) Car's here to pick you up and take you to the meeting."
S06E06,MR. PITT,(still staring at picture) Meeting?
S06E06,ELAINE,"Yeah, the Poland Creek merger?"
S06E06,MR. PITT,Why don't you go for me?
S06E06,ELAINE,How can I go?
S06E06,MR. PITT,"Oh, all they're gonna do is read the report."
S06E06,ELAINE,"Mr. Pitt, I do not think that is such a good idea."
S06E06,MR. PITT,"Oh, DAMN this thing!"
S06E06,JERRY,"(trying desperately to make conversation) So, Ceausescu. He must've been some dictator."
S06E06,KATYA,Oh yes. He was not shy about dictating.
S06E06,JERRY,"He, uh, he must've been dictating first thing in the morning. ""I want a cup of coffee and a muffin!"""
S06E06,KATYA,And you could not refuse.
S06E06,JERRY,"No, you'd have to be crazy."
S06E06,KATYA,He was a very bad dictator.
S06E06,JERRY,"Yes. Very bad. Very, very bad."
S06E06,JERRY,"So lemme get this straight you find yourself in the kitchen. You see an clair, in the receptacle. And you think to yourself, ""What the hell, I'll just eat some trash."""
S06E06,GEORGE,"No, no. No, no, no. It was not trash!"
S06E06,JERRY,Was it in the trash?
S06E06,GEORGE,Yes.
S06E06,JERRY,Then it was trash.
S06E06,GEORGE,"It wasn't down in, it was sort of on top."
S06E06,JERRY,But it was in the cylinder!
S06E06,GEORGE,Above the rim.
S06E06,JERRY,"Adjacent to refuse, is refuse."
S06E06,GEORGE,It was on a magazine! And it still had the doily on.
S06E06,JERRY,Was it eaten?
S06E06,GEORGE,One little bite.
S06E06,JERRY,"Well, that's garbage."
S06E06,GEORGE,But I know who took the bite. It was her aunt!
S06E06,JERRY,"Well, you, my friend, have crossed the line that divides Man and Bum. You are now a Bum."
S06E06,JERRY,Hey!
S06E06,KRAMER,Hey.
S06E06,JERRY,What's with you?
S06E06,KRAMER,I got a stone.
S06E06,JERRY,What stone?
S06E06,KRAMER,A kidney stone.
S06E06,JERRY,"What is that, anyway?"
S06E06,KRAMER,"It's a, it's a stony mineral concretion, formed abnormally in the kidney. And this jagged shard of calcium pushes its way through the ureter into the bladder. It's forced out through the urine!"
S06E06,JERRY,"Oh, that's gotta hurt."
S06E06,ARONSON,"Our shareholders have given basic approval for the merger, including the stock swap."
S06E06,ELAINE,"Ah. The ""stock swap"". Let's swap some stock. (giggles)"
S06E06,BECK,"And if you'll just give this to Mr. Pitt, and tell him we expect to be in full-scale production by the spring."
S06E06,ELAINE,"All right. (standing up) Hey, you guys--what's the name of the new company gonna be?"
S06E06,BECK,Moland Spring.
S06E06,ELAINE,"(making a face) ""Moland""?"
S06E06,ARONSON,"Yes, we combined Morgan and Poland."
S06E06,ELAINE,"Yeah, I know, but... ""Moland""? I wouldn't drink anything called ""Moland""."
S06E06,ARONSON,But it was Mr. Pitt's idea.
S06E06,ELAINE,"Oh! Well, ah, what's in a name? I mean, water's water. Right?"
S06E06,ARONSON,(to Beck) We've got to do something about that name.
S06E06,GEORGE,"(on phone, as Jerry gestures beside him) No, Lindsay, it was not IN the garbage. It was above the garbage. Hovering. Like an angel. Of course I know your aunt bit it. I kissed her goodbye. Listen, can I tell you something else? In my family, we used to eat out of the garbage all the time. (Jerry makes a face) It was no big thing. That's right. Oh, okay. Buh-bye. (hangs up phone) I'm back in, she gave me a second chance."
S06E06,JERRY,Good for you.
S06E06,GEORGE,"Yes, good for me!"
S06E06,JERRY,"Y'know what you should do now? Get her some flowers, smooth it out."
S06E06,GEORGE,"Yes, flowers. I will get her flowers, I will go to the florist!"
S06E06,KRAMER,"(enters apartment, holding up videotape) Behold! The Games of the '84 Olympiad! Katya's silver medal performance! (inserts tape into VCR, sets up TV)"
S06E06,JERRY,"Kramer, are you still on this? I've seen gymnasts. I know what they do. It's not going to make any difference."
S06E06,KRAMER,"Jerry, what is your problem?"
S06E06,JERRY,"Kramer, y'know, guys like you, with no conscience, don't know what it's like for guys like me. I'm in the unfortunate position of having to consider people's feelings."
S06E06,KRAMER,"All right, Jerry--are you familiar with the Kama Sutra?"
S06E06,JERRY,No.
S06E06,KRAMER,Tantric yoga?
S06E06,JERRY,No.
S06E06,KRAMER,"Jerry, you stand on the threshold to the magical world of sensual delights that most men dare not dream of!"
S06E06,JERRY,"Boy, you can really talk some trash. (to George) I guess that's better than eating it."
S06E06,KRAMER,"All right, all right, why don't we just watch the tape? (starts playback)"
S06E06,JERRY,All right.
S06E06,GEORGE,Did you pass your stone yet?
S06E06,KRAMER,Not yet. But the suspense is killing me.
S06E06,JERRY,"(pointing at TV) Hey, that's her!"
S06E06,KRAMER,"Oh yeah. Oh yeah, that's her. (feminine grunts and sighs can be heard as they watch the tape) Look at the height, Jerry, the extension! Now watch the tuck. Handstand, half-turn, giant into a straddle, back into another handstand. Nice kip. Reverse hecht. Oh, nice leg extension, good form! Now, here comes the big dismount. Look at the rotation, full in, double back, and she sticks the landing! (gets up to leave as George and Jerry continue to watch, mouths agape) Perhaps you'd like to keep the tape? (silence) Well, I'll take that as a yes."
S06E06,JERRY,"(smiling and excited) Well, here we are."
S06E06,KATYA,Yes. We are here.
S06E06,JERRY,"How did you stay on that beam like that? (holds up hand) I mean, it's only this wide!"
S06E06,KATYA,I can balance myself in any position.
S06E06,KATYA,"It is amazing after years of training how one can contort one's body. Of course, it is only useful in gymnastics."
S06E06,JERRY,Oh boy...
S06E06,JERRY,"I couldn't believe it. Uh, I mean I thought I was entering a ""magical world"" of sensual delights, but it was just so ordinary. I mean, there was nothing gymnastic about it."
S06E06,ELAINE,"Well, what did you think she was gonna do?"
S06E06,JERRY,"Well, you know. I mean... I dunno."
S06E06,ELAINE,"No, what?"
S06E06,JERRY,"Well, obviously I prefer not to mention any, you know..."
S06E06,ELAINE,"What did you think, she was going to take some of that chalk and..."
S06E06,JERRY,"You see, now I really don't want to get into this, any kind of specifics..."
S06E06,ELAINE,"Oh, come on. One thing? One thing! What?"
S06E06,JERRY,"Well... Frankly, I thought, you know, I was gonna kinda' be like the apparatus."
S06E06,KRAMER,You mean like the uneven parallel bars?
S06E06,JERRY,"See, again, I really don't feel that..."
S06E06,ELAINE,The balance beam?
S06E06,JERRY,Could we stop?
S06E06,ELAINE,(gasps in mock surprise) Not the pommel horse?
S06E06,JERRY,All right. Let's just drop it.
S06E06,JERRY,"So lemme ask you this how long would you say I have to put in now because of, you know, last night."
S06E06,ELAINE,"I dunno, at least three weeks."
S06E06,JERRY,"(sarcastic) Oh, great."
S06E06,ELAINE,"Jerry, that is such small potatoes. I think that I may have single-handedly put the kibosh on the big water merger."
S06E06,JERRY,Between Poland and Morgan?
S06E06,ELAINE,Yeah. Started a big name controversy.
S06E06,JERRY,Kramer! The stone!
S06E06,JERRY,"What happened, did you pass the stone?"
S06E06,KRAMER,"(Off-screen) No, I tried to do a reverse hecht off my couch and I didn't make it."
S06E06,GEORGE,"(singing as he exits florist with bouquet and a cup of coffee) ""...tootsie, good-bye. Too-too, tootsie..."" (takes a drink, makes a face, shouts back at shop) You call this coffee? (dumps out coffee behind him, accidentally hitting a parked car's windshield)"
S06E06,MAN IN CAR,Hey! What the hell was that?!
S06E06,GEORGE,I'm sorry! I'm terribly sorry! I- I-
S06E06,MAN IN CAR,Clean that up!
S06E06,GEORGE,"Oh, sure. Of course. (looks for place to set down flowers) Um, uh, could you hold these? For just a second, just a second. (grabs newspapers from trash bin, begins wiping windshield) Here you go, now don't worry about a thing. It's gonna be fine. Here we go. Look at this shine."
S06E06,MRS. ENRIGHT,"(sees George cleaning car windshield, looks appalled)"
S06E06,GEORGE,"Look at this sparkle. (looks up, sees Lindsay's mother) Mrs. Enright! (runs after her) Mrs. Enright! Mrs. Enright!"
S06E06,GEORGE,"(on phone, as Jerry gestures beside him) No, Lindsay, I had accidentally spilled coffee on the gentleman's windshield. Why would I do that? I have a job! Well, did she see a squeegee? Well, you're not going to make a dime without a squeegee. That's right, that's right, just tell your mother it was all a big misunderstanding. You won't regret it. Okay, I'll see you later. Buh-bye. (hangs up)"
S06E06,JERRY,Strike two!
S06E06,GEORGE,You think I'm going down?
S06E06,JERRY,You're behind in the count.
S06E06,GEORGE,I know.
S06E06,KRAMER,"(enters apartment, points at Jerry) Hey, what are you doing later?"
S06E06,JERRY,"I'm going out with Katya, thanks to you."
S06E06,KRAMER,"Well, maybe you should try again. You know what happens the first time people are a little shy, a little reticent."
S06E06,JERRY,"If I do it again, that extends my payment book another two weeks."
S06E06,KRAMER,"All right, where you going?"
S06E06,JERRY,We're going to the circus. One of her old Olympic teammates is an acrobat. I don't even feel like going out.
S06E06,KRAMER,"Well, Jerry, it's your obligation. C'mon."
S06E06,JERRY,"Yeah, well, y'know what? If I gotta go, and spend time with this girl, then you're coming with me, Dr. Cyclops!"
S06E06,KRAMER,"No, no, no, I don't wanna go to the circus, Jerry."
S06E06,JERRY,"Yeah, well you're going."
S06E06,KRAMER,"Yeah, but I'm afraid of clowns!"
S06E06,MR. PITT,"(in polo outfit, complete with jacket and high boots) I didn't send you over there to complain about the name."
S06E06,ELAINE,"Well, I couldn't help it. ""Moland Spring""?"
S06E06,MR. PITT,"I like the name ""Moland"". I picked it out. After all those months of negotiating!"
S06E06,ELAINE,"Well, I'm so sorry! I-"
S06E06,MR. PITT,"Well, I'm going riding. I haven't been on Jenny for three days, all because of this blasted painting. (phone rings) Elaine?"
S06E06,ELAINE,"Oh, sorry. (picks up phone) Hello?"
S06E06,MR. PITT,"(walks by 3-D poster, stops) Wait a minute! Wait a minute. Ah!"
S06E06,KATYA,"So, Jerry, you're enjoying the circus?"
S06E06,JERRY,"""Greatest Show on Earth""!"
S06E06,KATYA,"My father used to take me to the circus. When the elephants came by, he would scream curses at them, blaming them for all the ills of society."
S06E06,JERRY,"Well, they certainly take up a lot of space."
S06E06,KATYA,"Ah, Misha!"
S06E06,MISHA,Katya!
S06E06,KATYA,"Misha, this is Jerry."
S06E06,MISHA,"Ah, yes. The ""co-me-dian"", eh? (speaks in Romanian to Katya)"
S06E06,KATYA,"(laughs, replies in Romanian while pointing at Jerry)"
S06E06,ELAINE,"(on phone) Oh, yes, yes I'll tell him. Yes, thank you. Um, um hold on. (to Pitt) Mr. Pitt!"
S06E06,MR. PITT,(staring at 3-D poster) I think I'm on to something!
S06E06,ELAINE,Mr. Pitt! The board of directors is on the phone. They've called an emergency meeting. They want you to be there to discuss the merger!
S06E06,MR. PITT,"You said keep your eyes out of focus, which is misleading. You want DEEP focus!"
S06E06,ELAINE,"(on phone) Yes, hi. Okay, fine, yeah, hold on just a second. Lemme just... (reaches into purse) Yeah, I've got it... (pulls out both hands completely covered in black ink) Oh! Oh! Yeah, yeah, he'll be there. (drops phone, rushes to Pitt) Mr. Pitt, you have GOT to stop staring at that poster!"
S06E06,MR. PITT,I see something that could be a spaceship. Is it round? Is it pointy?
S06E06,ELAINE,"(grabs poster, smashes it) No, you don't see it, and you're never going to see it! (grabs Pitt by the lapels, getting ink all over his jacket) Mr. Pitt, you have to meet with the shareholders, you have to leave now. Do you hear me? Do you hear me?!"
S06E06,MR. PITT,"Hmm, what's happened to me? (straightens lapels) When's the meeting?"
S06E06,ELAINE,In about twenty minutes.
S06E06,MR. PITT,"Oh! (puts finger to face, smearing ink on his upper lip which now resembles an ""Adolph Hitler""-style moustache) Do I have time to change?"
S06E06,ELAINE,"Um, no."
S06E06,MR. PITT,"Well, excuse me, I'd better get straight over there."
S06E06,ELAINE,"Uh, Mr. Pitt..."
S06E06,MR. PITT,Yes?
S06E06,ELAINE,"Um, there's a just... (points at her own upper lip)"
S06E06,MR. PITT,(sees Elaine's hands covered in ink) Is that ink?
S06E06,ELAINE,No?
S06E06,GEORGE,"Well, here we are."
S06E06,LINDSAY,Do you want to come in? My mother's having a little party.
S06E06,GEORGE,Maybe I could just use the bathroom.
S06E06,LINDSAY,Sure.
S06E06,ANNOUNCER,"(voiceover) Ladies and gentlemen, could I direct your attention to the center ring, where the incomparable Misha will balance ten stories above the circus floor on a wire no wider than a human thumb."
S06E06,MISHA,It is time.
S06E06,JERRY,"Well, break a leg."
S06E06,JERRY,"Eh, show biz..."
S06E06,ANNOUNCER,"Ladies and gentlemen, the incomparable Misha!"
S06E06,JERRY,"Boy, those capes are really coming back."
S06E06,PARTY GUEST,"(exits bathroom, finds George waiting) Oh, sorry I took so long. They've got one of those 3-D art posters in there. (wipes eyes) It's mesmerizing."
S06E06,JERRY,What is that sound?
S06E06,KATYA,(covering ears) It is horrible!
S06E06,GEORGE,"Whew! Anybody see that poster in there? That is weird, wild stuff, huh? Whew!"
S06E06,MR. PITT,"I have been accused of wrong-doing. But these false accusations will not deter us. We WILL annex Poland by the Spring, at any cost! AND... our stock will rise HIGH! (raises hand)"
S06E06,KATYA,He'll be all right. I must go and be with Misha now. I don't want you to come with me.
S06E06,JERRY,"Oh, why not?"
S06E06,KATYA,It has been three days since our night together. Misha said that was all the time I needed to put in.
S06E06,JERRY,Really?
S06E06,KATYA,"In my country, they speak of a man so virile, so potent, that to spend a night with such a man is to enter a world of such sensual delights most women dare not dream of. This man is known as the ""Comedian"". You may tell jokes, Mr. Jerry Seinfeld, but you are no Comedian. (walks off)"
S06E07,WAITRESS,"O.K. Cowboys, (taps pencil on her pad) What'll you have?"
S06E07,JERRY,"Ill have the, ah, turkey club without the bacon."
S06E07,GEORGE,"And ah, Ill have the bacon club without the turkey. (raises eyebrows)"
S06E07,WAITRESS,"George, don't make me get tough with you."
S06E07,GEORGE,"Why, you think you can, beat me up?"
S06E07,WAITRESS,You wouldn't want me to mess up the beautiful face of yours.
S06E07,GEORGE,"Huh, nggh [snort] Stop. (flirting with her he playfully hits her arm with the menu, then flicks it into the air)"
S06E07,WAITRESS,You don't want bacon Ill surprise you. (she turns and walks away)
S06E07,GEORGE,"Wow, is she not terrific?"
S06E07,JERRY,She does have a way.
S06E07,GEORGE,"You think she thinks I have a beautiful face, or is she just saying that?"
S06E07,JERRY,Well they do work on tips.
S06E07,GEORGE,"George, don't make me get tough with you. Whu, hu, hu, hu huuuu (raises arms) Who says that? She is really cool. What do you think? You think she likes me?"
S06E07,JERRY,"Ah, I should have got the egg white omelet."
S06E07,GEORGE,"Why should she like me? Who am I? Huh, there's a million people to like."
S06E07,JERRY,The omelet. Damn.
S06E07,GEORGE,Maybe she could like me? Is it that far fetched? Maybe she sees something? Is it possible?
S06E07,JERRY,No.
S06E07,GEORGE,No.
S06E07,JERRY,Not possible.
S06E07,GEORGE,Not possible.
S06E07,ELAINE,"Heyyyyyy (leaning in, very friendly and happy)"
S06E07,GEORGE,Hey Elaine.
S06E07,JERRY,"Lannie, how was the trip?"
S06E07,GEORGE,What trip? You were gone?
S06E07,ELAINE,"I went to England ... with Mr. Pitt, for 5 days."
S06E07,GEORGE,"Hunh, pph (raises hands slightly, in amazement) How was it?"
S06E07,ELAINE,"Actually it was great. I met an Englishman, and we really, hit it off."
S06E07,JERRY,"Yeah, well that relationships really got a lot of potential."
S06E07,GEORGE,he he (laughs)
S06E07,ELAINE,"Yeah well Jerome, I, happen to be flying him in on my frequent flyer miles."
S06E07,GEORGE,Flying him in? How longs he staying for?
S06E07,ELAINE,It's an open ended ticket. He can return any time he wants.
S06E07,GEORGE,All this in 5 days. Hmm.
S06E07,JERRY,"Oh no, it's Kenny Bania."
S06E07,GEORGE,Who's he?
S06E07,JERRY,"(quietly) Oh, he's this awful comedian."
S06E07,BANIA,Hey Jerry.
S06E07,JERRY,"Hey Kenny. (with some fake enthusiasm, just to be polite)"
S06E07,JERRY,"Elaine, George (introducing them to Bania with less enthusiasm)"
S06E07,ELAINE,Hi. (she flips her hair)
S06E07,GEORGE,Hi (raises his left hand in a slight gesture to say hi)
S06E07,BANIA,Hi. (to Elaine)
S06E07,JERRY,How's it going?
S06E07,BANIA,"Great. I've been working out. Went from a size 40, to a 42."
S06E07,JERRY,No kidding.
S06E07,BANIA,"Yeah, Im huge (ducks his head into his right shoulder with false modesty) Well, Ill leave you guys alone. (raps his knuckle twice on the table, turns and walks away)"
S06E07,JERRY,All right.
S06E07,ELAINE,O.K. Thanks.
S06E07,BANIA,"Oh. Jerry, You know what just hit me? I was thinking -- What size suit are you?"
S06E07,JERRY,"Ahh, Im a 40. Why?"
S06E07,BANIA,I just got a brand new Armani suit -- doesn't fit me anymore. You want it?
S06E07,JERRY,Well I don't know if I ...
S06E07,BANIA,Oh come on. Why should it just sit in the closet?
S06E07,ELAINE,An Armani suit?
S06E07,GEORGE,Take the suit.
S06E07,JERRY,"Well ... ok, I guess (voice trailing off)"
S06E07,BANIA,You gonna be home later?
S06E07,JERRY,Yeah.
S06E07,BANIA,"Ill drop it off. (raps his knuckle twice on the table again, turns and walks away)"
S06E07,GEORGE,"Heh heh heh hey, new suit (raises coffee cup as a salute / toast)"
S06E07,JERRY,"Yeah, yeah, lucky me. (sips coffee)"
S06E07,WAITRESS,(to George) Here I personally made you a cold chicken sandwich. It's not even on the menu.
S06E07,GEORGE,"(takes a large bite - with his mouth still full, his speech is muffled) Oh, this is fabulous."
S06E07,GEORGE,"Boy, she is nice. I like her, I like her Jerry. She's got substance. She oozes substance."
S06E07,JERRY,"Well, go in there and talk to her. She's not going to put em on the glass."
S06E07,GEORGE,"You mean a walk back in? That's the toughest move in the business. You're sending me out into no-mans-land, and if I get shot down I have to crawl all the way back. Well I can't do it! I can't do it, I tell ya!"
S06E07,JERRY,Pull yourself together. Your going in there soldier! That's an order!
S06E07,JERRY,Get in there. (he pushes George in the direction of the restaurant)
S06E07,KRAMER,"Hey. (walking over to Jerry, who sits at the table reading the newspaper)"
S06E07,JERRY,Hey.
S06E07,KRAMER,"Listen, I need you to do me a favor."
S06E07,JERRY,What?
S06E07,KRAMER,"Well, I need you to help me move my refrigerator."
S06E07,JERRY,Why?
S06E07,KRAMER,Cause Im getting rid of it.
S06E07,JERRY,YEAH? (speaking loudly so the visitor can hear him through the intercom)
S06E07,BANIA,"[It's K.B., I have the suit]"
S06E07,JERRY,"ALL RIGHT, COME ON UP (Jerry puts his head down - he's not looking forward to Kenny Bania)"
S06E07,KRAMER,(claps hands) So ...
S06E07,JERRY,"Well, well, why are you getting rid of your refrigerator? (he gets up from the table and carries a dish into the kitchen)"
S06E07,KRAMER,Well after that Kidney Stone I only want fresh food. It's gotta be fresh. Im not eating any more stored food. Plus you know I want the space.
S06E07,JERRY,What for?
S06E07,KRAMER,"Well I could put a, dresser in there. I could get dressed while Im making breakfast."
S06E07,BANIA,Hey (holds the Armani suit up) Here you go. (walks into the apt.)
S06E07,JERRY,Yeah.
S06E07,BANIA,"You didnt think I was really going to give you a suit, did you?"
S06E07,KRAMER,"What, you're giving him this suit?"
S06E07,BANIA,"That's right, and it's an Armani."
S06E07,KRAMER,"Armani? Hey, Armani Jerry. (Kramer takes the suit and looks it over)"
S06E07,JERRY,"Yes, yes, I heard."
S06E07,KRAMER,"Come on, try it on."
S06E07,JERRY,"No, it's ok."
S06E07,KRAMER,"Come on, I want to see how it fits."
S06E07,JERRY,"All right, all right. (trying on the suit jacket)"
S06E07,KRAMER,There you go.
S06E07,JERRY,"Ok, Yeah all right."
S06E07,KRAMER,"Oh boy, that looks great. I can't believe you're giving him this."
S06E07,BANIA,I don't even want anything for it.
S06E07,KRAMER,"He's very generous, isn't he?"
S06E07,JERRY,"Yes, yes, he is."
S06E07,BANIA,Ill tell you what -- you can take me out to dinner sometime.
S06E07,JERRY,Dinner?
S06E07,BANIA,Yeah. You buy me a meal -- you can't get a better deal than that (pats Jerry on the shoulder)
S06E07,KRAMER,"No, you'll never get a better deal than that."
S06E07,BANIA,All right. Ill leave you alone. (turns and walks out the door)
S06E07,JERRY,"Yeah, Ill see you."
S06E07,KRAMER,"All right, ooh look at that Armani, huh, yeah."
S06E07,JERRY,"Yeah, that's a deal. That's a terrible deal. I don't want to go out to dinner with him. Id rather make my own suit."
S06E07,GEORGE,I did it! It's all done!
S06E07,JERRY,Hey. (raises hands into fists of encouragement)
S06E07,GEORGE,"I did it. Hunh, we're going out as soon as she gets off of work and it'll still be daytime. You know I, Im much better in the daytime then I am at night. it's less pressure."
S06E07,JERRY,"I love the day date. No wine, No shower."
S06E07,GEORGE,There ya go.
S06E07,ELAINE,So the trip was good?
S06E07,SIMON,"Yes (nice English accent) Apart from that, dreadful airline food. It tends to reek havoc with my stomach."
S06E07,ELAINE,"You know I, I have to say, I've never admitted this to anyone, but um, I kind of like airline food. (leans in and laughs, flirting with him)"
S06E07,SIMON,That's probably because of ... [muttering]
S06E07,ELAINE,What?
S06E07,SIMON,What?
S06E07,ELAINE,"Yeah, what?"
S06E07,SIMON,[sighs]
S06E07,ELAINE,What?
S06E07,SIMON,"Where I come from, we don't say What? It's proper to say Pardon?"
S06E07,ELAINE,Huh. (muttering) This should be interesting.
S06E07,SIMON,Pardon?
S06E07,ELAINE,Nothing.
S06E07,KELLY,"So then about a year ago I started selling, these funky little hair clips. It's going pretty good. I make them in my apartment."
S06E07,KELLY,"Im just doing this waitress thing for a while, because I wanted to go to Europe this summer"
S06E07,GEORGE,(quietly) ahh.
S06E07,KELLY,and I could use a few extra ... Careful
S06E07,GEORGE,"Oh. It's just horse manure (huh huh - laughs, he points back at the horse that walked by) Horse manure's not that bad. I don't even mind the word manure. You know, it's, it's nure, which is good. and a ma in front of it. MA-NURE. I mean when you consider the other choices, manure is actually pretty refreshing."
S06E07,KELLY,That's a nice watch George.
S06E07,GEORGE,Yeah.
S06E07,KELLY,"You know, my boyfriend has the same one."
S06E07,GEORGE,Huh. Really?
S06E07,KELLY,"Yeah, he loves watches. He's a real watch freak."
S06E07,GEORGE,"Well, how about that?"
S06E07,KELLY,Ooh look out. (pointing at the ground - squishing sound) You stepped right in it.
S06E07,GEORGE,"Yes, I sure did."
S06E07,JERRY,So you just pretended it didnt bother you?
S06E07,GEORGE,"What is that, Boyfriend? I don't understand that. What, what does she think I asked her out for?"
S06E07,JERRY,"Boy, It's the way they just slip it in there too."
S06E07,GEORGE,"Yeah, yeah, like it's just part of the conversation. Oh my boyfriend really likes watches. He's a real watch freak. We-e-ell that's fabulous. (snaps fingers in the air a couple of times)"
S06E07,JERRY,Well let me ask you this. What exactly did you say when you asked her out?
S06E07,GEORGE,"I said, would you like to go for a walk or something."
S06E07,JERRY,"Oh, a walk, well --"
S06E07,GEORGE,"Or something. I said, Or Something!"
S06E07,JERRY,"Or something. Yeah, that's a date."
S06E07,GEORGE,(snaps fingers) There you go.
S06E07,JERRY,"Course you know there is always the possibility, that she called an audible."
S06E07,GEORGE,What do you mean?
S06E07,JERRY,"Well she got up to the line of scrimmage, didnt like the looks of the defense and changed the play."
S06E07,GEORGE,I think things were going ok. We were having a nice conversation.
S06E07,JERRY,Uh huh.
S06E07,GEORGE,I mentioned how I liked horse manure.
S06E07,JERRY,You did?
S06E07,GEORGE,Yeah.
S06E07,JERRY,Yeah. You said you liked horse manure.
S06E07,GEORGE,Yeah.
S06E07,JERRY,(quietly) Mm-hm.
S06E07,GEORGE,"You know, about how when you break it down, it's really a very positive thing. you know, you have a nure, with a ma in front of it. MA-NURE. Iz not bad."
S06E07,JERRY,And it was around this point that she mentioned the boyfriend?
S06E07,GEORGE,"Yeah. (Jerry nodding) ... Oh, you think because of what I said about the manure. I wa, wa, was just saying how it takes a negative thing, and puts it on a positive spin on it."
S06E07,JERRY,Im just saying there's a chance she may not have been enamored with your thoughts and feelings on manure.
S06E07,GEORGE,So you don't think she really has a boyfriend?
S06E07,JERRY,"My honest opinion, I think she made it up."
S06E07,GEORGE,"Well then she's just a Liar, Isn't she?"
S06E07,KRAMER,Hey.
S06E07,JERRY,"Aaa. Well ... you want something to eat, don't you?"
S06E07,KRAMER,"Ahh, no, no, no. You got me all wrong buddy. I am loving this no refrigerator. You know what I discovered? I really like depriving myself of things. It's fun. Very monastic."
S06E07,GEORGE,Well what do you eat?
S06E07,KRAMER,"It's all fresh. Fresh fish, fresh foul, fresh fruit. I buy it, I omniga nominga, I eat it."
S06E07,JERRY,Well Im glad it's working out.
S06E07,KRAMER,"Oh yeah, it's working out. And I got a date with that waitress who works at Reggies."
S06E07,JERRY,"Boy, if I could meet a hostess, we could open up our own place."
S06E07,KRAMER,"Ha ha ha ha. Yeah, well, Ill tell you, she's a full-figured gal."
S06E07,JERRY,Is she?
S06E07,KRAMER,"Oh you better believe it buddy. Hey George, we could double sometime."
S06E07,GEORGE,"Yeah, yeah, yeah we could. You know, ah, Kramer, the next time you talk to her, find out if she knows Kelly, from Monk's. I wanna know if she really has a boyfriend."
S06E07,KRAMER,All right it's done.
S06E07,JERRY,Hello?
S06E07,BANIA,"Hi, Jerry. It's Kenny."
S06E07,JERRY,"Oh, Hi."
S06E07,BANIA,"You know, I was thinking if you're not busy, maybe I can get my meal today?"
S06E07,JERRY,"Yeah, you wanna get that meal, don't you?"
S06E07,BANIA,"How about Mendys, ooh, ever been there?"
S06E07,JERRY,No I haven't?
S06E07,BANIA,Ah youre gonna love it. Ill meet you there around 700.
S06E07,JERRY,All right.
S06E07,BANIA,Ahh.
S06E07,JERRY,"(hangs up the phone) Yeah, I really needed that suit."
S06E07,BANIA,"I start off with curls. That's good for the bicep. (motions with 2 fingers along his right bicep) I do 10 reps, 2 sets."
S06E07,JERRY,Mm. That's fantastic. (he could care less)
S06E07,BANIA,You work out with weights?
S06E07,JERRY,No I don't.
S06E07,BANIA,You should.
S06E07,JERRY,Why?
S06E07,BANIA,You worn the suit yet?
S06E07,JERRY,"No, not yet."
S06E07,WAITER,have you decided?
S06E07,BANIA,"Oh, get the swordfish. Best swordfish in the city. The best, Jerry."
S06E07,JERRY,Ill have the salmon.
S06E07,WAITER,And you?
S06E07,BANIA,"Ahh, you know what I think. Im just going to have soup. Yeah, Ill save the meal for another time."
S06E07,JERRY,Another time? What other time?
S06E07,BANIA,I had a hot dog earlier. Im not that hungry.
S06E07,JERRY,"No, no, Bania, no. This is the dinner. The soup counts."
S06E07,BANIA,Soup's not a meal. You're supposed to buy me a meal.
S06E07,JERRY,Im not stopping you from eating. Go ahead and eat. Get anything you want.
S06E07,BANIA,But I don't want anything but soup.
S06E07,JERRY,Then that's the meal.
S06E07,BANIA,But I had the hot dog.
S06E07,JERRY,I didnt tell you to have a hot dog. Who told you to have a hot dog?
S06E07,BANIA,"Hey, I give you a brand-new Armani suit, and you won't even buy me a meal?"
S06E07,JERRY,"All right, fine. Get the soup!"
S06E07,JERRY,So he just gets soup. He wants to save the meal. So now I got to do it all over again.
S06E07,ELAINE,What kind of soup did he get?
S06E07,JERRY,I don't know? Consomm or something.
S06E07,ELAINE,"Consomm, hmm."
S06E07,JERRY,What?
S06E07,ELAINE,"Well, that's not really a meal Jerry. I mean, if he had gotten, Chicken Gumbo, or Matzah Ball, even Mushroom Barley. Then I would agree with you. Those are very hardy soups."
S06E07,JERRY,Elaine you're missing the whole point.
S06E07,ELAINE,What?
S06E07,JERRY,"The meal is the act of sitting down with him. It doesn't matter what you get, as long as he's sitting in that restaurant, its a meal."
S06E07,ELAINE,Was it a cup or a bowl?
S06E07,JERRY,"You see -- ah, uh ..."
S06E07,ELAINE,Im just curious.
S06E07,JERRY,"A bowl, ok?"
S06E07,ELAINE,Did he crumble any crackers in it?
S06E07,ELAINE,"(reiterating the question) Did he crumble, any crackers in it?"
S06E07,JERRY,"As a mater of fact, he did."
S06E07,ELAINE,"Oh, well. Crackers in a bowl. That -- That could be a meal."
S06E07,JERRY,It's like Im talking to my Aunt Sylvia here.
S06E07,ELAINE,"Oh, hi Simon. This is Jerry."
S06E07,SIMON,"Hello. (to Jerry, politely -- then quickly turns to Elaine) Elaine, do you have any cash on you?"
S06E07,ELAINE,"Um, yeah in my purse."
S06E07,SIMON,No. There was only six dollars.
S06E07,JERRY,"Well, I have some money. What do you need? (pulls out some bills)"
S06E07,SIMON,"Well, 20 should cover me. (snatches the cash) Thanks mate. (he walks down the stairs to the sidewalk)"
S06E07,ELAINE,Where you going?
S06E07,SIMON,(starts to turn back to Elaine) Just visiting.
S06E07,ELAINE,"Oh, OK, see you later."
S06E07,SIMON,I won't be back for dinner. (turns and walks off down the street)
S06E07,ELAINE,(English accent) Pardon?
S06E07,JERRY,So is she working? Is she here?
S06E07,GEORGE,"Yeah, yeah, she's here."
S06E07,JERRY,Have you said anything to her?
S06E07,GEORGE,"No, but Im very uncomfortable."
S06E07,JERRY,Are you going to say anything?
S06E07,GEORGE,There she is. (waiving his arms quickly above the table - to nix the conversation) No no no no no no.
S06E07,KELLY,Hello
S06E07,GEORGE,Hello.
S06E07,KELLY,"Well, what's it going to be?"
S06E07,GEORGE,What's it gonna be?
S06E07,KELLY,Yes. What'll you have? Are you eating? It's in that vein.
S06E07,GEORGE,"Ill eh, Ill just have a bowl of chili."
S06E07,JERRY,Ill have an egg white omelet.
S06E07,GEORGE,What's it gonna be? ... You hear that?
S06E07,JERRY,"Yeah, that was bad."
S06E07,GEORGE,Did you feel that tension? We use to have banter - (puts menu back with frustration) - there's no more banter.
S06E07,JERRY,"Oh, no, it's Kenny. Slide out so he can't sit down. (George & Jerry each slide to the end of their booth seats)"
S06E07,BANIA,Hey.
S06E07,JERRY,Hey.
S06E07,BANIA,You worn the suit yet?
S06E07,JERRY,"Actually, I did. I put it on last night and slept in it."
S06E07,BANIA,You did?
S06E07,JERRY,"... Oh, Im joking."
S06E07,BANIA,OH! Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha. Can I squeeze in? (to George)
S06E07,GEORGE,Sure you can.
S06E07,KELLY,Can I take your order?
S06E07,BANIA,What kind of soup do you have?
S06E07,JERRY,Why don't you get a sandwich?
S06E07,BANIA,"Ok, Ill have tomato soup and ah, tuna on toast."
S06E07,JERRY,OK ... (nodding his head up and down) This is it cha know
S06E07,JERRY,This is the meal ... so stock up buddy boy.
S06E07,BANIA,What are you talking about? this isn't a meal.
S06E07,JERRY,Yes it is. Soup and sandwich. That is a meal.
S06E07,BANIA,"You're supposed to buy me dinner in a nice restaurant, like Mendys."
S06E07,JERRY,I tried to do that.
S06E07,BANIA,This is lunch in a coffee shop
S06E07,JERRY,"Doesn't matter, This is it. This completes the transaction."
S06E07,BANIA,"Ah, soup and a sandwich for a brand-new Armani suit. Is that any kind of gesture? (turns to George)"
S06E07,BANIA,Im really not comfortable ...
S06E07,KRAMER,"(to George) Hey, I just spoke to ah, Hilde about your friend."
S06E07,GEORGE,Yeah.
S06E07,KRAMER,She doesn't have a boyfriend. She made it up.
S06E07,JERRY,Hi.
S06E07,ELAINE,Hi.
S06E07,JERRY,Where's Simon?
S06E07,ELAINE,"Oh, he'll be right up. He's just getting some beer. And Im not expecting ... any change. (leans forward as she brings her hands together in front of her, then sits on the couch)"
S06E07,JERRY,When's he leaving? (putting some items into the refrigerator)
S06E07,ELAINE,"About 2 days. Although he's hinting at how he'd like to stay. Fortunately he has no money, and no prospects. (she smiles)"
S06E07,SIMON,Hey mate. Fancy a beer?
S06E07,JERRY,"Ah, no thanks."
S06E07,JERRY,"(on the phone) Hello? No, Im sorry Bania ... Im not going over this again. Well who told you to order soup? ... No! There's no dinner. There's not going to be any dinner. You've had a sandwich and 2 bowls of soup and that's it. Good-bye."
S06E07,JERRY,"Hey, what size suit are you?"
S06E07,SIMON,40.
S06E07,JERRY,"40. Perfect. Brand-new Armani suit, you want it?"
S06E07,SIMON,Absolutely.
S06E07,JERRY,"Great, its yours. I can't stand the sight of it. Elaine, heres the car keys. (tosses her the keys)"
S06E07,ELAINE,Thanks
S06E07,JERRY,Yo?
S06E07,BANIA,"Listen Jerry, I've been doing some thinking. I want my suit back."
S06E07,JERRY,I don't have your suit. I gave it away.
S06E07,BANIA,Well it's my suit.
S06E07,JERRY,Well it's gone. Im sorry. Good-bye Bania.
S06E07,KRAMER,Hey.
S06E07,JERRY,Hey.
S06E07,KRAMER,"Um, yeah. (glances around the apt.) Oh, uh ... well, how's everything? (clap)"
S06E07,JERRY,Ok.
S06E07,KRAMER,"Good, ah, (clap) what's going on?"
S06E07,JERRY,Nothing.
S06E07,KRAMER,Really.
S06E07,JERRY,"You want food, don't cha? (nodding his head up and down)"
S06E07,KRAMER,"It's not for me. It's for Hilde -- the waitress I was telling you about. She's hungry, she wants food. If I go back in there without any food ... there's gonna be trouble. (his voice gets really high pitched on his last sentence)"
S06E07,JERRY,"All right, go ahead"
S06E07,KRAMER,Thanks buddy. (goes over to the fridge and pulls out a few things)
S06E07,HILDE,Did you find anything!
S06E07,KRAMER,"Uh, yeah, ah ..."
S06E07,KRAMER,"There's a few things in here, ah, peanut butter, cheese, yeah ..."
S06E07,HILDE,"Cheese is good. Yeah, what kind?"
S06E07,KRAMER,"Uh, Swiss."
S06E07,HILDE,"All right, it'll have to do. Come on."
S06E07,JERRY,What are we doing out here? Aren't we going to go in and eat?
S06E07,GEORGE,I can't go in there. Im too uncomfortable.
S06E07,JERRY,"Oh, w-what are you saying? So we're not going to go in there anymore?"
S06E07,ELAINE,"Hey, What are you doing out here?"
S06E07,JERRY,"We can't eat here anymore, because he took a waitress out for a walk."
S06E07,GEORGE,What's the difference? Let's go to Reggies.
S06E07,ELAINE,Reggies? I can't eat anything there.
S06E07,GEORGE,It's the same menu.
S06E07,ELAINE,There's no Big Salad.
S06E07,GEORGE,"They'll make you a Big Salad. What do you think, they're the only one's that make a Big Salad?"
S06E07,ELAINE,"All right. Let's go, to Reggies."
S06E07,JERRY,So what's going on with Simon? Did he leave?
S06E07,ELAINE,Ahh ... wait till you hear this.
S06E07,ELAINE,"So Simon picks this woman up, right in front of me."
S06E07,JERRY,"Look at this. They make a point of saying on the menu, No egg white omelets. Look at that."
S06E07,GEORGE,So what! Have a yoke! It won't kill you.
S06E07,HILDE,(walks up to the table) Hello.
S06E07,JERRY,"Oh, hi Hilde. Can I get an egg white omelet?"
S06E07,HILDE,Did you read the menu?
S06E07,JERRY,"All right, just give me a western. (unhappy)"
S06E07,ELAINE,How bout a Big Salad?
S06E07,HILDE,A big salad?
S06E07,ELAINE,(to George) Ya see?
S06E07,GEORGE,"Just tell her whatcha want, they'll make it for ya."
S06E07,ELAINE,"It's a salad, only bigger, with lots of stuff in it."
S06E07,HILDE,I can bring you 2 small salads.
S06E07,ELAINE,Could you put it in a big bowl?
S06E07,HILDE,We don't have big bowls.
S06E07,ELAINE,All right. Just give me a cup of decaf.
S06E07,HILDE,We have Sanka.
S06E07,GEORGE,"I mean, it's not fair. I've been going there for 7 years. She's been there 3 weeks."
S06E07,JERRY,Not fair.
S06E07,GEORGE,"If anyone should be forced to leave that place, it should be her!"
S06E07,JERRY,She's on your turf.
S06E07,GEORGE,If only she could get fired. Is there any way that could happen? I mean I know how to get myself fired.
S06E07,JERRY,You're the best.
S06E07,GEORGE,Well ...... but how do I get someone else fired?
S06E07,JERRY,"Well as I see it, you've got to apply the same principles that get you fired, but redirected, outwardly."
S06E07,KRAMER,H-Hey. She's hungry Jerry.
S06E07,JERRY,"Well, there's nothing left. There's no food."
S06E07,KRAMER,No food? Well you gotta have something -- (rummages through Jerry's cupboards and refrigerator) -- I can't go back in there with no food. She's expecting something Jerry. You don't know what she's like when that blood sugar drops.
S06E07,HILDE,(from Kramer's apartment) Food!
S06E07,KRAMER,"There, you see. She's already in a bad mood. She just got fired."
S06E07,JERRY,Why'd she get fired?
S06E07,KRAMER,"Oh, because I called over there a couple of times and the manager didnt like it."
S06E07,ELAINE,"So, Simon is definitely going back now. He's meeting me here to return my keys."
S06E07,JERRY,"Boy, he's a real bounder, isn't he?"
S06E07,ELAINE,Yes. He's one of those bounders.
S06E07,KELLY,Egg white omelet and Big Salad.
S06E07,ELAINE,AHhh. Thank you.
S06E07,KELLY,"I just wanted you guys know that Friday's my last day. Bloomingdales ordered a bunch of my clips, thank God, I don't have to do this any more. (turns and walks away)"
S06E07,ELAINE,Ah (hu ha - small laugh)
S06E07,BANIA,"Hey Jerry, where's my suit?"
S06E07,JERRY,I don't have it. You want half my omelet? (holds his omelet plate up to Bania)
S06E07,MONK'S MANAGER,"(on the phone, we assume it's George calling) I told you, she's busy. She can't come to the phone now! (hangs up)"
S06E07,MONK'S MANAGER,You better tell your boyfriend to stop calling here.
S06E07,KELLY,"Oh he's not my boyfriend. It's that bald guy with the glasses, who's always here with them. He's trying to get me in trouble."
S06E07,MONK'S MANAGER,"HEY! Yeah. I got a message for you. You tell your friend George, that the next time I see him around here, Im going to turn him into my Own, Personal, Hand-Puppet."
S06E07,SIMON,"Well, hello. Here you are as promised. You see, Im a man of my word. (drops keys into Elaine's extended palm)"
S06E07,ELAINE,When are you leaving?
S06E07,SIMON,"Elaine, are you trying to get rid of me? Aha ha ha ha ha ha ha. I was supposed to leave tomorrow, but all of a sudden, I've been set up with a job interview that might enable me to extend my visit indefinitely. And it is all due, to this suit. How do I look? Im a shoe-in aren't I. Thanks again love. (touches the table, turns and walks to the exit)"
S06E07,ELAINE,(turns towards the lunch counter) Hey Kenny. You still want to get that suit back?
S06E07,BANIA,(leans backwards from the counter) Yeah!
S06E07,ELAINE,There it goes. (pointing at Simon walking out the door)
S06E07,BANIA,Hey! Hey! (he runs out the door after Simon; from outside) Come Here You!
S06E07,SIMON,(from outside Monk's) What are you doing? Unhand me!
S06E07,BANIA,(from outside Monk's) Take It Off!
S06E08,CAR SALESMAN,"George, are you sure I can't show you any other cars?"
S06E08,GEORGE,"I don't think so, Vic. I've done my homework. '89 Volvo, that's the car for me, it's the one I want."
S06E08,SALESMAN,I got a LeBaron convertible right here.
S06E08,GEORGE (chuckles),N.I. Not interested.
S06E08,SALESMAN,"It's got a few more miles on it, but the previous owner was John Voight."
S06E08,GEORGE (suddenly interested),Jon Voight?
S06E08,JERRY,"Okay, Tim. You're welcome. (Hangs up.)"
S06E08,ELAINE,Was that Tim Whatley?
S06E08,JERRY,"Yes, it was. He wanted your address - you, my friend, are going to be invited to his night-before-Thanksgiving party. (Elaine raises her hands triumphantly, then gleefully struts her way to the kitchen.) You know, he's got that great apartment on 77th street, and they overlook where they inflate all those huge balloons for the Macy's Thankgiving Day Parade?"
S06E08,ELAINE,I have always had a big crush on Tim Whatley. Why can't he ask me out? (Punctuates this by shoving Jerry.)
S06E08,JERRY,"Oh, he's a dentist. You don't want to go out with a dentist."
S06E08,ELAINE,Why?
S06E08,JERRY,"He'll always be criticizing your brushing technique, it'll drive you crazy. (Mimics brushing his teeth) Away from the gums... (The door opens a little, George jangles the keys to his new car at Jerry and Elaine, then enters.)"
S06E08,JERRY,Uh - new car!
S06E08,ELAINE,Ohhh!
S06E08,JERRY,Hey! Did you get the Volvo?
S06E08,GEORGE,"No, I decided to go with an '89 LeBaron."
S06E08,ELAINE,A LeBaron?
S06E08,JERRY,I thought Consumer said Volvo was the car.
S06E08,GEORGE,What Consumer? I'm the consumer.
S06E08,JERRY,Alright. Seems like...a strange choice.
S06E08,GEORGE,"Well, maybe so...but it was good enough for Mr. Jon Voight."
S06E08,ELAINE,Jon Voight? The actor?
S06E08,GEORGE (boasting),That's right. He just happened to be the previous owner of the vehicle.
S06E08,JERRY,You bought a car because it belonged to Jon Voight?
S06E08,GEORGE (defensive),"No, no..."
S06E08,JERRY,"I think yes, yes. You like the idea of telling people you're driving Jon Voight's car."
S06E08,GEORGE,"Alright, maybe I do. So what."
S06E08,ELAINE,"I've never even seen him in a car. I mean, look at his movies. No cars. Deliverance - canoe. Midnight Cowboy - boots. Runaway Train...runaway train. (Kramer enters.)"
S06E08,KRAMER,Hey.
S06E08,JERRY,Hey.
S06E08,KRAMER,"Jerry, you know that shoe repair place at the end of the block? Well, if they don't get some business, they're gonna have to shut down and make way for one of those gourmet coffee or cookie stores."
S06E08,ELAINE,I like coffee.
S06E08,GEORGE,"I like (imitates Kramer) ""cookies."""
S06E08,KRAMER,"Yeah, of course you do. And do you know why? Because you're a bunch of yuppies. It's your go-go corporate takeover lifestyles that are driving out these Mom and Pop stores and destroying the fabric of this neighborhood."
S06E08,GEORGE,"Well, what's so great about a Mom and Pop store? Let me tell you something. If my Mom and Pop ran a store, I wouldn't shop there."
S06E08,KRAMER,"Hey, Bogambo - they've been in the neighborhood for 48 years. Now, come on, Jerry. You've gotta have a pair of shoes in need of a cobblin.'"
S06E08,JERRY,I really don't wear the kind of shoes that have to be cobbled.
S06E08,KRAMER,"Well, what about sneakers? You know, they'll clean 'em. They do complete detailing."
S06E08,JERRY,"Alright, take 'em."
S06E08,KRAMER (happily),Yeah-yah.
S06E08,POP,"Kramer, without you, we'd be out of business."
S06E08,KRAMER,"Well you know, these sneakers, they belong to my neighbor, Jerry Seinfeld? The comedian."
S06E08,MOM,So many sneakers!
S06E08,KRAMER,"Well, he's got a Peter Pan complex."
S06E08,POP,They'll be ready a week from Thursday.
S06E08,KRAMER,"Oh, well, no rush. (wipes his nose) Uh oh."
S06E08,MOM,What's the matter?
S06E08,KRAMER,"Oh, I keep getting these nosebleeds."
S06E08,MOM,"Oh, lie down, and put your head back."
S06E08,KRAMER,"Yeah. (Lies on the couch and cracks the back of his head against the armrest.) Hey, what's with your ceiling? (Mom and Pop look up.)"
S06E08,POP,What?
S06E08,KRAMER (stuffing tissue up his nose),"Well, you got wires sticking out every which way. That looks dangerous, you should call the electrician."
S06E08,POP,"You know, in the 48 years we've been here, I don't think we've ever called an electrician."
S06E08,KRAMER,"Yeah well, you should. This place could blow any minute."
S06E08,MR. PITT,Elaine?
S06E08,ELAINE,"Yes, Mr. Pitt?"
S06E08,MR. PITT,Have you gotten all the salt off those pretzels yet?
S06E08,ELAINE,"No, I'm still working on it."
S06E08,MR. PITT,What in blazes are you listening to?
S06E08,ELAINE,"Artie Shaw. ""Honeysuckle Jump."" (The song ends.)"
S06E08,DJ ON RADIO,"That was Artie Shaw, ""Honeysuckle Jump."""
S06E08,MR. PITT,Elaine! How did you know that?
S06E08,ELAINE,"Oh, my father used have a huge collection of big band records."
S06E08,DJ ON RADIO,"Congratulations to our listener Wayne Hopper for identifying it. And by doing so, he becomes our seventh person to land the WFBB-sponsored Woody Woodpecker balloon in the Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade. (Mr. Pitt hears this and is intrigued; mouths the words ""Woody Woodpecker."") There are only three spots left. We're going to take a little break now; when we come back, you'll have three more chances to win a spot holding a rope under Woody Woodpecker."
S06E08,"MR. PITT (to Elaine, excited)",Could you identify the next song? Could you? Could you?
S06E08,ELAINE,"Mr. Pitt, why would you want to hold onto the ropes on the Woody Woodpecker balloon?"
S06E08,MR. PITT,My father was a stern man. He forbad us to participate in any activities that he thought were associated with the common man. The Thanksgiving Day Parade was first on the list.
S06E08,ELAINE,"Oh. Alright, I'll do the best I can. (Turns up the radio.)"
S06E08,DJ ON RADIO,"Alright, here we go for the next spot under the balloon. If you know the name of this song, call 555-BAND. (The music starts. Elaine listens intently.)"
S06E08,MR. PITT (impatiently),"Well, Elaine? Do you know it? What song is it?"
S06E08,ELAINE,Will you shut up? I can't hear!
S06E08,MR. PITT,I'm sorry!
S06E08,ELAINE,"Oh! I've got it! It's ""Next Stop Pottersville""! (Grabs the phone to call it in.)"
S06E08,MR. PITT (overjoyed),"Goody! Yes! Yes! Yes! (Dances back and forth, elated) Next Stop Pottersville, Next Stop Pottersville! You are a genius!"
S06E08,GEORGE,You are gonna love this car. Even if you don't like Jon Voight.
S06E08,JERRY,"I like Jon Voight. Just seems like kind've a strange reason to buy a car, because he might have driven it."
S06E08,GEORGE,"What do you mean ""might""? You don't think he really owned this car?"
S06E08,JERRY,I don't know.
S06E08,GEORGE,"Well, why would the guy make up something like that? Of all the names he could pick, why settle on Jon Voight?"
S06E08,JERRY,"Don't you see, that's the genius of it. If he had said Liam Neeson, you'd know he's making it up."
S06E08,GEORGE,"Neeson? How are you comparing Liam Neeson with Jon Voight? Jerry, we're talking about Joe Buck. If you can play Joe Buck, Oskar Schindler's a cake walk. (Opens the car door for Jerry, Jerry's about to get in.)"
S06E08,JERRY,"Oh, look at this, I stepped in gum."
S06E08,GEORGE,"Whoa, whoa, you're not getting in my car with gummy shoes."
S06E08,JERRY (shuts the car door),"Alright, I'll change my shoes. (Heads back to his apartment. George follows.)"
S06E08,GEORGE (unimpressed),"Liam Neeson. You know, he's not American."
S06E08,JERRY,Let me get a clean pair. (Goes into his room. George strides over to the window.)
S06E08,GEORGE (singing),Everybody's talkin' at me...I can't hear a word they're sayin'...just drivin' around in Jon Voight's car...
S06E08,JERRY (yelling from his room),Kramer! (We hear Kramer's door slam open and shut. Kramer enters. Jerry comes out of his room.) Hey! Where's all my sneakers?
S06E08,KRAMER,You said take 'em.
S06E08,JERRY,Not all of 'em!
S06E08,KRAMER,"Well, obviously there was a miscommunication."
S06E08,JERRY,Obviously. So what am I supposed to wear?
S06E08,KRAMER,"Jerry, I left you a pair right here...(goes into Jerry's room and comes out with a pair of cowboy boots.) C'mon. There, put on those boots."
S06E08,JERRY,I can't wear these!
S06E08,KRAMER,"Well, why not?"
S06E08,JERRY,They're uncomfortable.
S06E08,KRAMER,"C'mon here, try 'em on. (Jerry sits down and puts the boots on.)"
S06E08,GEORGE,Where did you get those?
S06E08,JERRY,"I worked a club in Dallas one time and they couldn't afford to pay me so they gave me these. Oh, I can't wear these! (Stands up.) They look ridiculous!"
S06E08,KRAMER,"Ah, you look like a cowboy! Huh?"
S06E08,JERRY,But I don't wanna be a cowboy!
S06E08,KRAMER,"Oh, stop it. You know that friend of yours, Tim the dentist? I got an invitation to his Thanksgiving Eve party."
S06E08,GEORGE,"Yeah, I got one too."
S06E08,KRAMER,Yeah?
S06E08,JERRY,Oh yeah? Huh.
S06E08,GEORGE,What?
S06E08,JERRY,"No, nothing."
S06E08,GEORGE,"No, what is it?"
S06E08,JERRY,"No, it's just that I, uh...didn't get one."
S06E08,GEORGE,You didn't get one?
S06E08,JERRY,"Ah, but he called me up and he asked for yours and Elaine's addresses, I'm sure that means I'm invited."
S06E08,KRAMER,Not necessarily.
S06E08,JERRY,"Hey, why would you call someone up and ask them for two addresses if you're not invited to the party?"
S06E08,GEORGE (mocking Jerry),That's the genius of it.
S06E08,JERRY (picks up the phone),I'm callin' Elaine. See if she can find out anything from Tim Whatley.
S06E08,GEORGE (to Kramer),Hey. I got Jon Voight's LeBaron. (Jingles the keys.)
S06E08,KRAMER (impressed),Boss!
S06E08,POP,Four thousand dollars? We can't afford that!
S06E08,ELECTRICIAN,"Well I'm afraid you're gonna have to do something about it, because it's in violation of the building code. Otherwise, they're gonna close you up."
S06E08,POP,But what if we can't pay for it?
S06E08,ELECTRICIAN,"Then I have to report you. Otherwise, I lose my license. Sorry. (Exits.)"
S06E08,POP,"48 years, Mom! And now we have to close! All because of that idiot and his bloody nose! (Kramer enters.)"
S06E08,KRAMER,"Afternoon, Mom! Afternoon, Pop. You know you got a crack in the sidewalk out there? Now, you oughta get that fixed."
S06E08,GEORGE,So?
S06E08,JERRY,"C'mon, put the top up, it's November!"
S06E08,GEORGE,"I feel alive, Jerry."
S06E08,JERRY,"Let's check out the glove box. (Opens the glove compartment, takes out a pencil.) Ah. Pencil."
S06E08,GEORGE,"Hey...you don't think...sure, that's Jon Voight's pencil!"
S06E08,JERRY,With Jon Voight's teeth marks. (Looks at the owner's manual.) Owner's manual...you know what? This car was owned by Jon Voight.
S06E08,GEORGE,Ah! See? I told ya.
S06E08,JERRY,Except Jon is spelled with an H. J-O-H-N.
S06E08,GEORGE,So?
S06E08,JERRY,Doesn't Jon Voight spell his name J-O-N?
S06E08,GEORGE (pulls over),"So, what are you saying?"
S06E08,JERRY,"Nothing. I'm sure ""Jon"" probably mispelled his own name. I know sometimes I spell Jerry with a G...and an I! (Laughs uproariously.)"
S06E08,GEORGE (angrily),Get out of the car!
S06E08,JERRY,What?
S06E08,GEORGE,"That's right, you heard me. Get out! You are ruining this whole experience for me!"
S06E08,JERRY (sarcastically),"Oh, look! There's Gregory Peck's bicycle!"
S06E08,GEORGE,Get out!
S06E08,JERRY,And Barbara Mandrell's skateboard!
S06E08,GEORGE,Get out!! (Jerry gets out and George drives away. A couple of guys notice Jerry in his cowboy boots.)
S06E08,TOUGH GUY (threatingly),"Hey, cowboy. Where's your horse? (Jerry slips and slides in his cowboy boots and runs away.) Yeah, you better run!"
S06E08,GEORGE,Did they take anything?
S06E08,JERRY,"No, they didn't even touch me. I tripped because of these stupid cowboy boots."
S06E08,GEORGE,"Anyway, again, I'm sorry about throwing you out of the car."
S06E08,JERRY,You really seemed to enjoy it.
S06E08,GEORGE,"It was kinda fun. (Elaine gives Jerry a cold cloth for his jaw.) You know, maybe his name really is J-O-H-N, but he changed it to J-O-N for show business. Well, you know, J-O-N is a lot zippier."
S06E08,JERRY (sarcastic),"Yeah, that's possible."
S06E08,GEORGE,"How would you find out something like that...wait a minute, what am I thinking? I've got the entire Yankee organization at my disposal."
S06E08,JERRY (to Elaine),He'll dispose of it.
S06E08,GEORGE,"Heh, that's right. See ya later. (Exits.)"
S06E08,ELAINE,"So Jerome, I did a little snooping around for you."
S06E08,JERRY,"Ah! What'd you find out, Lois?"
S06E08,ELAINE,"Well, I talked to Tim Whatley..."
S06E08,JERRY,Yeah...
S06E08,ELAINE,"And I asked him, ""Should Jerry bring anything?"""
S06E08,JERRY,So...?
S06E08,ELAINE,"Mmmm...and he said, ""Why would Jerry bring anything?"""
S06E08,JERRY,"Alright, but let me ask you this question."
S06E08,ELAINE,What?
S06E08,JERRY,"Which word did he emphasize? Did he say, ""Why would Jerry bring anything?"" or, ""Why would Jerry bring anything?"" You emphasize ""Jerry"" or ""bring."""
S06E08,ELAINE,"I think he emphasized ""would."""
S06E08,JERRY,"You know what? The hell with this party, I don't even want to go to begin with. (Kramer enters.)"
S06E08,KRAMER,Hey.
S06E08,JERRY,"Hey, so where's my sneakers?"
S06E08,KRAMER,That's what I wanna know.
S06E08,JERRY,What do you mean?
S06E08,KRAMER,"Well, I saw Mom and Pop this morning, but when I went by the store on my way home? The place was empty. Everything is gone. Mom and Pop - vrooop - vanished."
S06E08,JERRY,So all my sneakers are gone?
S06E08,KRAMER,I'm afraid so. And that's just the tip of the iceberg. I've been asking around - they didn't even have any kids.
S06E08,JERRY,Mom and Pop aren't even a Mom and Pop?!
S06E08,KRAMER,"It was all an act, Jerry. They conned us, and they scored, big time."
S06E08,ELAINE (amused),"So. Mom and Pop's plan was to move into the neighborhood...establish trust...for 48 years. And then, run off with Jerry's sneakers."
S06E08,KRAMER,Apparently.
S06E08,ELAINE,"Alright, that's enough of this."
S06E08,JERRY,Where ya goin'?
S06E08,ELAINE,I gotta go to the Dixieland Deli to pick up Mr. Pitt's security pass for the parade.
S06E08,JERRY,Why does he want to hold a rope underneath Woody Woodpecker in the Thanksgiving Day Parade?
S06E08,ELAINE,"He finds his laugh ""intoxicating."" (Laughs like Woody Woodpecker, and exits.)"
S06E08,MR. MORGAN,"So George, what kind of promotional events are we talking about?"
S06E08,GEORGE,"Well, I think we need more special days at the stadium, you know? Like, uh...Joe Pepitone Day. Or, uh...Jon Voight Day."
S06E08,MR. MORGAN,"Jon Voight? The actor? (Rubs his eyes wearily.) Uh, I make a motion that we have no more of these meetings that have been initiated by George Costanza."
S06E08,GEORGE,"I suppose if I had suggested Liam Neeson Day, you'd all be patting me on the back."
S06E08,CONTEST WINNER (to Elaine),"I guessed Stan Herman's ""Boomtown Blues."" What'd you guess?"
S06E08,ELAINE,"Um, it was, uh...""Next Stop Pottersville."" (The group is unimpressed.) Uh, do you know when they're giving out the passes?"
S06E08,CONTEST WINNER,After the music. (The band starts playing directly behind Elaine. She is deafened by the loudness of the horns.)
S06E08,KRAMER,Oh. Oh man. (Takes out a Kleenex and puts his head back. Jon Voight comes out of a doorway and hails a cab.)
S06E08,VOIGHT,Taxi! (Walks right by Kramer.) Taxi.
S06E08,KRAMER,"Hey! Jon Voight! Jon Voight! (Voight waves at Kramer and hurriedly gets in the cab. Kramer runs over to the car.) Hey, listen, can I ask you something? Listen, listen...(Leans in the the open back window of the cab. Defensively, Voight grabs Kramer's arm and bites it. Kramer screams. The cab speeds off leaving Kramer in the street, stunned.)"
S06E08,JERRY,"No Jon Voight Day, huh?"
S06E08,GEORGE,"No. Now I'll always have this doubt about the car. What, your jaw still hurts?"
S06E08,JERRY,"Yeah, it's all swollen. I think I may have chipped a tooth when I fell yesterday."
S06E08,GEORGE,You should have somebody take a look at that.
S06E08,JERRY,"I'm calling dentists all day here, there's nobody working the day before Thanksgiving."
S06E08,GEORGE,You going to the party?
S06E08,JERRY,"No, I don't know if I'm invited."
S06E08,GEORGE,"Well, there's going to be a lot of dentists there."
S06E08,JERRY,"Yeah, you're right."
S06E08,GEORGE,You don't want to suffer with this all weekend.
S06E08,JERRY,"Yeah, I gotta see a dentist, this is killin' me. Well, I'll take a chance. We'll go together."
S06E08,GEORGE,Maybe I'll just meet you there.
S06E08,JERRY,You don't want to go with me?
S06E08,GEORGE,"Jerry, for all I know this guy went out of his way to not invite you. How am I gonna feel if I show up with an uninvited, unwelcome intruder?"
S06E08,JERRY,"The way I feel when I go places with you? (Kramer enters.) Hey, so'd you find my sneakers yet?"
S06E08,KRAMER,"No. (To George) But I did run into somebody you might be interested in, a Mr. Jon Voight, the actor?"
S06E08,GEORGE,Jon Voight! Are you kiddin' me? Did you talk to him?
S06E08,KRAMER,"Well, he was a little standoffish."
S06E08,GEORGE,"What, you didn't ask him about the car?"
S06E08,KRAMER,"No, I couldn't, his cab pulled away. But he did, however, make an impression on me. (Pulls up his sleeve and shows George his arm.) Look."
S06E08,JERRY,What?
S06E08,KRAMER,His tooth marks. He bit me.
S06E08,GEORGE,Jon Voight bit you?
S06E08,JERRY,"Well, what is he, a vampire?"
S06E08,KRAMER,"No, it's justifiable. He thought I was going for his wallet."
S06E08,GEORGE (looking at Kramer's arm),He left perfect imprints.
S06E08,KRAMER,"That he did. Now, you got that pencil with the bite marks on it? We get a trained eye to match 'em up, and we'll see whether or not you're driving Jon Voight's car!"
S06E08,JERRY,"Oh, please."
S06E08,GEORGE,"Wait a minute, wait, it's not that stupid."
S06E08,JERRY,"No, it's stupid."
S06E08,GEORGE,"Why? Why isn't it possible? I mean, they're both bite marks."
S06E08,JERRY,So you're gonna show up at that party with a chewed-up pencil and Kramer's gnarled arm.
S06E08,GEORGE,It's worth a shot. (Goes to the door.)
S06E08,JERRY,"So, Kramer, you wanna go to the party together?"
S06E08,KRAMER,"Jerry, look, come on, I'm an invited guest. I can't be aiding and abetting some...party-crasher."
S06E08,"JERRY (under his breath, to a man at the party)","Excuse me, uh...dentist? You a dentist? (The guy shakes his head. Jerry moves on to another guy.) Dentist? Are you a dentist?"
S06E08,GEORGE,"These are the balloons? Big deal, all I see is Woody Woodpecker."
S06E08,KRAMER,You got a problem with Woody Woodpecker?
S06E08,GEORGE,"Yeah, what is he? Some sort of an instigator?"
S06E08,KRAMER,That's right. He's a troublemaker.
S06E08,JERRY,"Hey, Elaine. Did you get my message?"
S06E08,ELAINE,What? I can't hear a word you're saying. I was stuck at the Dixieland Deli all day. My head is still ringing. Where's Tim?
S06E08,JERRY (pointing at the trophy),"What is that, the Empire State Building?"
S06E08,ELAINE,What? I can't hear you.
S06E08,JERRY,"Elaine, would you marry me?"
S06E08,ELAINE,"I told you, I can't hear a word."
S06E08,JERRY,Alright. Forget it.
S06E08,GEORGE,"Hey, Tim."
S06E08,TIM,"Hey, George. Kramer, how ya doin.' (They shake hands.)"
S06E08,GEORGE,"Watch the arm! Tim, listen, we don't want to bother you, we know you're busy here."
S06E08,TIM,"No, it's no problem, what is it?"
S06E08,GEORGE,"Let me show you something, take a look at this... (Another guy at the party interrupts.)"
S06E08,GUY,"Alright Tim, I'm gonna get goin.'"
S06E08,TIM,"Alright, let me take down your number. (Grabs George's pencil, then notices Jerry sitting on the couch.) Is that Jerry Seinfeld?"
S06E08,KRAMER,He didn't come with us. (Tim walks over to Jerry.)
S06E08,GEORGE,"Uh, Tim, the pencil..."
S06E08,TIM,Jerry.
S06E08,JERRY,"Hey, Tim."
S06E08,TIM,Jerry. I didn't think you'd show.
S06E08,JERRY,"Did you say, ""Jerry, I didn't think you'd show"" or, ""Jerry, I didn't think you'd show""? (Elaine comes over.)"
S06E08,TIM,Elaine! Hi!
S06E08,ELAINE,Tim.
S06E08,TIM,Well. I'm really glad you came.
S06E08,ELAINE,What?
S06E08,TIM,Really glad you came.
S06E08,ELAINE (deaf),Uh huh.
S06E08,TIM (picks up a bowl of nuts),"Listen, Elaine, I've been wanting to ask you...would you like to go out with me New Years Eve? (Elaine thinks Tim is offering her a nut, and shakes her head no. Tim, rejected, walks away.) Thanks."
S06E08,ELAINE (puzzled),What? What?
S06E08,GEORGE,Let me ask you something. Could you tell if teeth marks on someone's arm matched teeth marks on a pencil?
S06E08,DENTIST,It's possible.
S06E08,GEORGE (to Kramer),Roll up your sleeve.
S06E08,DENTIST,Somebody bit you?
S06E08,KRAMER,Not just someone. Jon Voight.
S06E08,DENTIST,"Jon Voight bit you? (George notices Tim across the room with the pencil in his mouth.) The pencil! Hey, hey! Get the pencil out of your mouth, you're destroying Jon Voight's teeth marks!"
S06E08,TIM,That's John Voight's pencil?
S06E08,GEORGE,That's right. I got his whole car downstairs.
S06E08,TIM,Are you the one who bought his LeBaron convertible?
S06E08,GEORGE (overjoyed to find out),"Yes! Yes, I'm the one! Hey! So, you know Jon Voight!"
S06E08,TIM,"Yes! Yes, I went to dental school with him."
S06E08,GEORGE,"Jon Voight, the actor?"
S06E08,TIM,No. The periodontist. (George snaps the pencil in two.)
S06E08,DENTIST,Can't this wait until Monday? Come by my office.
S06E08,JERRY,Just a quick peek. I'm in agony.
S06E08,DENTIST,Alright. Sit down.
S06E08,JERRY (sits down),"It's this one here in the back. (Tilts his head back, and knocks Elaine's trophy out the window. A loud hissing sound and commotion is heard from the street below. Everyone runs to the windows to look.)"
S06E08,KRAMER,Oh! You popped Woody Woodpecker!
S06E08,TIM (to Jerry),"Hey, who invited you, anyway? You're a troublemaker! (Jerry nervously laughs like Woody Woodpecker as the breeze from the popped balloon blows in the window.)"
S06E08,ANNOUNCER ON TV,"Hey, it looks like Woody Woodpecker is running out of air. In fact, he's collapsing."
S06E08,KRAMER,Those kids look pretty disappointed.
S06E08,JERRY,"Especially that big kid up in the front. (Mr. Pitt is shown on the television, trying to hold up the deflating Woody balloon.) How old is he? (The phone rings.) Hello?"
S06E08,GUY ON PHONE,"Hello, is this Jerry Seinfeld?"
S06E08,JERRY,Yes it is.
S06E08,GUY ON PHONE,"You don't know me, but a really strange thing happened. I was at a garage sale, and this old couple sold me a used pair of sneakers they claimed belonged to Jerry Seinfeld, the comedian."
S06E08,JERRY,"Can I have the address of that garage sale? Okay, thank you very much. (To Kramer) I found Mom and Pop, they're sellin' my sneakers!"
S06E08,KRAMER,Where are they?
S06E08,JERRY,"Parsippany, New Jersey."
S06E08,KRAMER,Let's go!
S06E08,JERRY,My car's in the shop.
S06E08,KRAMER,"Well, how are we getting to Parsippany?"
S06E08,KRAMER,Uh. Jerry. These nosebleeds are starting again.
S06E08,JERRY (wipes Kramer's brow),Maybe we should get you to a hospital.
S06E08,KRAMER (a la Ratso Rizzo in Midnight Cowboy),"Hey, I ain't goin' to no Bellevue! Look at me, I'm fallin' apart here."
S06E09,GEORGE,Well I am actually going to have a secretary and I get to do the interview.
S06E09,JERRY,That's incredible. Six months ago you were taking messages for your mother.
S06E09,GEORGE,"Yeah, and now someone's going to be taking messages for me."
S06E09,JERRY,From your mother.
S06E09,JERRY,"So this ah, woman you plan on hiring, is she going to be in the Spokes model category?"
S06E09,GEORGE,"Sure. I could go the tomato route. But eh, I've given this a lot of thought Jerry. All that frustration. Ill never get any work done. So Im doing a complete 360. Im going for total efficiency and ability."
S06E09,JERRY,"That's a 180, George."
S06E09,GEORGE,Whatever.
S06E09,JERRY,Hi Willie.
S06E09,WILLIE,Hey Jerry.
S06E09,JERRY,I got this stuff and ah my mother's fur coat for storage.
S06E09,WILLIE,What are you doing with it?
S06E09,JERRY,"Ah, she keeps it in my apartment for when she comes up from Florida."
S06E09,DONNA,Hi.
S06E09,JERRY,Hi.
S06E09,WILLIE,"Hey Jerry, you know my wife Donna."
S06E09,JERRY,"Yeah, that's why I said hi."
S06E09,WILLIE,"Hey, nice jacket. (looking over the jacket)"
S06E09,JERRY,Thanks. It's Hounds-Tooth.
S06E09,WILLIE,"Whoa, this is a beauty. Great cut. It's probably very flattering."
S06E09,JERRY,"Oh yes, it really accentuates my bust line."
S06E09,APPLICANT,"Well, I type about 90 words a minute. Im completely well-versed in all IBM and Macintosh programs."
S06E09,GEORGE,"(looking over her resume) Well Miss Coggins you're ah, obviously qualified for the job. You've all the necessary skills and experience. But you're extremely attractive. you're gorgeous. Im looking at you, I can't even remember my name. So ah, Im afraid this is not going to work out (he crumples her resume into a ball) Thanks for coming in."
S06E09,GEORGE,You're luscious. You're ravishing. I would give up red meat just to get a glimpse of you in a bra. Im terribly sorry. (both George and the attractive female applicant stand up as George reaches across the desk and shakes her hand for coming in)
S06E09,ADE,"As you can see my references are impeccable. I think Id be a real asset here. My only concern is, I do take care of my mother. So will there be any late nights?"
S06E09,GEORGE,I can't imagine.
S06E09,ELAINE,"Ok, So Barneys is having this huge sale. I try this dress on -- (holds the garment bag out towards Jerry) -- Stunning. Stunning. I couldn't take my eyes off myself."
S06E09,JERRY,Yeah.
S06E09,ELAINE,"OK, so then I put it on at home. It looks like Im carrying twins."
S06E09,JERRY,"So you're saying, Store -- Hotsy-Totsy, Home-- Hotsy-Notsy."
S06E09,ELAINE,Yeah exactly. Anyway I've got to go over there and return it.
S06E09,JERRY,I thought we were going to the movies?
S06E09,ELAINE,All right Ill try it on again. You tell me what you think. (she turns and goes into the bedroom to change clothes)
S06E09,GEORGE,Hey hey.
S06E09,ELAINE,Hey George
S06E09,GEORGE,"Hey Elaine. (George hangs up his raincoat next to the door) Im telling you Jerry, having a secretary is incredible. (George claps hands) I don't know why I didnt have one before."
S06E09,JERRY,Because you didnt have a job?
S06E09,GEORGE,"Perhaps. (hehe) I walk in, everything is organized -- messages, appointments. And I can't tell you how proud I am of myself for going with Ade."
S06E09,JERRY,A lesser man would have crumbled. They would have gone for the dish and the sure fire sexual-harassment suit.
S06E09,JERRY,It's a little ...
S06E09,ELAINE,All Right! (throws arms down) You answered it right there.
S06E09,JERRY,You got no waist in that thing.
S06E09,GEORGE,You arms look like something hanging in a kosher deli.
S06E09,ELAINE,"I said, All Right."
S06E09,GEORGE,Well whad you buy it for?
S06E09,ELAINE,"Why did I buy it, because in the mirror, at Barneys, I looked fabulous. This woman was just walking by said I looked like Demi (the ""i"" sounds like an ""e"") Moore in Indecent Proposal."
S06E09,JERRY,How fast was she walking?
S06E09,GEORGE,"Demi (the ""i"" sounds like an ""e"")? I thought it was Demi?"
S06E09,JERRY,"No. I think it's Demi. (the ""i"" sounds like an ""e"")"
S06E09,GEORGE,"Really? I never heard of a semi (the ""i"" sounds like an ""e"") tractor-trailer. (Jerry nods in agreement)"
S06E09,ELAINE,"Wait a minute (claps hands) Wait a minute. I know what's going on here. Skinny Mirrors! (she pushes George and Jerry in their respective chests, with her arms extended -- one arm for each of them -- they recoil with surprise)"
S06E09,JERRY,What?
S06E09,ELAINE,"Skinny Mirrors! Barneys has Skinny Mirrors, they make you look, like, 10 pounds lighter."
S06E09,JERRY,"Oh, you're crazy."
S06E09,ELAINE,Am I? (hands on hips) Do you think I would have bought this dress if I looked like this at Barneys?
S06E09,GEORGE,"(to Jerry, as Jerry nods in agreement) You know I think she might have something there."
S06E09,KRAMER,Whoa. What are you all dressed up for?
S06E09,ELAINE,Oh Im returning this dress to Barneys.
S06E09,KRAMER,Good idea.
S06E09,JERRY,Do it tomorrow. Well go to the movies.
S06E09,ELAINE,"Yeah yeah, ok."
S06E09,KRAMER,"Hey look, if you're going there, maybe you could pick me up some of this super hydrating, it's a total-protection moisturizer with Uva."
S06E09,ELAINE,Moisturizer? That's girls stuff.
S06E09,KRAMER,"No no, look. Ill tell you what -- they're having a sale right."
S06E09,ELAINE,yeah.
S06E09,KRAMER,"Ill meetcha down there, well have lunch."
S06E09,ELAINE,Well we could ...
S06E09,KRAMER,"Well, well get to know each other. We never get to spend any time together. Oh sure we have our little group here, but ... (he looks and gestures out towards George and Jerry, as Elaine walks back into the bedroom to change out of the dress -- Kramer scratches his head in sort of disbelief)"
S06E09,GEORGE,"And then assuming the strike is resolved, on April 14th, we, ah, play the Angels. So lets clear a floor at the Anaheim Hotel."
S06E09,ADE,Anaheim Hotel. (George picks up a container of chinese food from the credenza) You may want to reconsider. I believe they only have room service until 10 P.M. and then it's only finger foods.
S06E09,GEORGE,"Ade, you're a wonder. (he he -- george laughs)"
S06E09,ADE,"OK, now I projected some of those figures for you regarding the switch to Canola oil for the stadium popcorn and surprisingly it will only come to 1/2 a cent more per bag, so it is definitely doable."
S06E09,GEORGE,"Ade, I have to tell you, I, I have never met anybody so ... efficient."
S06E09,ADE,"Well thank you, Im flattered."
S06E09,GEORGE,"I mean you're just, you're just a marvel of organization."
S06E09,ADE,"Well Im just, hm, doing my job."
S06E09,GEORGE,"It's like Im thinking of something, and you're (snaps fingers) one step ahead of me."
S06E09,ADE,What can I say? Im ... Im good at what I do. (smiling and quietly laughing proudly)
S06E09,GEORGE,"(coyly, he looks down and runs his finger along the top of the chair back in front of him) Do you, uh ... do you know what Im ... thinking about now?"
S06E09,ADE,"(thinking about the question, she stops writing) Yes, I think I do. (she turns her head slowly and looks directly at him)"
S06E09,GEORGE,"Is it, uh, doable?"
S06E09,ADE,It's definitely doable.
S06E09,JERRY,"Well, that was the worst."
S06E09,ELAINE,I cant believe they made the Wife the killer. (putting on gloves) Gimme a break.
S06E09,MAN,"(waiting in line for tickets, he overhears Elaine) Hey, give us a break. We haven't seen it yet. Thanks a lot big mouth!"
S06E09,Another man,"(waiting in line, closer to the box office) Yeah! (in agreement with the other guy)"
S06E09,KRAMER,You got a pen?
S06E09,JERRY,"Yeah, I think I do."
S06E09,KRAMER,And I need something to write on.
S06E09,JERRY,"Well, all I got is my dry-cleaning stub."
S06E09,KRAMER,"I gust met Uma Therman. She's giving me her telephone number. Uma Jerry, Uma."
S06E09,JERRY,Uma Therman? Really?
S06E09,KRAMER,Yeah.
S06E09,ELAINE,How'd you manage that.
S06E09,KRAMER,Yeah well I don't have any time to talk now. (he rushes back into the theater)
S06E09,JERRY,"He's got the Kavorca. (looking towards the theater door, Jerry notices one of the movie goers) Hey, isn't that Willie, my dry-cleaner?"
S06E09,ELAINE,Where?
S06E09,JERRY,"He just went in. You know, I think he was wearing my Hounds-Tooth jacket."
S06E09,ELAINE,What would he be doing wearing your jacket?
S06E09,JERRY,It looked just like the jacket I brought in to be dry-cleaned. He complimented me on it.
S06E09,ELAINE,Are you sure?
S06E09,KRAMER,"I got it. Uma, Uma, Uma. (looking at the ticket)"
S06E09,ELAINE,You are amazing.
S06E09,KRAMER,"Yeah, all right. Taxi's on me. (he walks off camera)"
S06E09,ADE,"Ah no no no no no. A better way to reach the bra would be to undo the jacket, then go around the back of the shirt."
S06E09,GEORGE,Ade you are incredible
S06E09,ADE,"Oh ...oh ...oh ... Here, I want to show you something. Hand me that pillow."
S06E09,GEORGE,"What? Oh, My God!"
S06E09,ADE,Mr. CO STAN ZA!
S06E09,GEORGE,"Ade, ahh, ahh, ah ... Im giving you a raise!"
S06E09,JERRY,"So you're having sex and then all of a sudden, you just blurt out Im giving you a raise."
S06E09,GEORGE,Yeah.
S06E09,JERRY,Just a quick sidebar here -- are you in anyway authorized to give raises?
S06E09,GEORGE,"Not that Im aware of, no."
S06E09,JERRY,"So you're so grateful to have sex, that you'll just shout out anything that comes into your head."
S06E09,GEORGE,I didnt think ahead.
S06E09,JERRY,Well maybe she'll just think it was bawdy talk.
S06E09,GEORGE,I didnt say any other bawdy things.
S06E09,JERRY,Maybe you could have sex with her again and then take it back.
S06E09,GEORGE,"All right, you know you're not any help at all here. I don't know what even the point is of talking to you anymore."
S06E09,JERRY,"All right, all right. Im sorry."
S06E09,GEORGE,"Yeah, well, I guess the only thing I can do is go into George Steinbrenners office and tell him he has to give her a raise."
S06E09,JERRY,How long has she been there?
S06E09,GEORGE,3 days.
S06E09,JERRY,It's almost a week.
S06E09,JERRY,"Oh, My god."
S06E09,GEORGE,What?
S06E09,JERRY,"It's a movie stub from the 930 show. George, I think Willie the dry-cleaner has been wearing my clothes."
S06E09,ELAINE,"These mirrors are skinny mirrors. This is false ... reflecting. And I think, that the department of ... you know, whatever, would be very interested to know what's going on here."
S06E09,BARNEY'S SALES ASSOCIATE,"Well, we're more than happy to exchange it for something else."
S06E09,ELAINE,OK fine. (smiling) I did like that little Calvin Klein number right by the elevator. You know the little ... (motions in the direction of the elevator)
S06E09,BARNEY'S SALES ASSOCIATE,Ill bring it to your dressing room.
S06E09,ELAINE,Ok thanks so much. (the Barneys sales associate turns and walks away. Elaine turns to Kramer as he admires himself in the mirror) What are you all dressed up for?
S06E09,KRAMER,"Well Elaine, when you're shopping on Madison Avenue, you don't want to skip on the, swank."
S06E09,ELAINE,I like your little bag.
S06E09,KRAMER,"Huh, oh hey, look at this. (he pulls a little tube out of the bag) It's the super hydrating, triple-action moisturizer, hmm."
S06E09,ELAINE,Huh.
S06E09,KRAMER,Wait till that Uma smells this Uva.
S06E09,BANIA,Hey Kramer.
S06E09,KRAMER,"Hey Bania, what's happening? (Kramer, looking into the mirror, is putting moisturizer under his eyes)"
S06E09,BANIA,Im looking for a new suit. I cant find anything I like. That's a nice suit. (admiring Kramers suit)
S06E09,KRAMER,"Well, thank you."
S06E09,BANIA,Did you get that here?
S06E09,KRAMER,"No, this is vintage. They don't make this stuff anymore."
S06E09,BANIA,You're telling me.
S06E09,KRAMER,I sure am.
S06E09,BANIA,It's hard for me to find pants that --
S06E09,KRAMER,(interrupting Bania) That don't make you look high-waisted.
S06E09,BANIA,Yes
S06E09,KRAMER,Me too.
S06E09,BANIA,What size are you?
S06E09,KRAMER,"Uh, 42."
S06E09,BANIA,"42, That's what I am now. I've been working out, Im huge. How'd you like to sell it?"
S06E09,KRAMER,make me an offer.
S06E09,BANIA,100 Bucks
S06E09,KRAMER,Surely you jest. (walks away from Bania)
S06E09,BANIA,175
S06E09,KRAMER,Look at the stitching (takes the jacket off to show Bania) This is old world craftsmanship.
S06E09,BANIA,300 dollars.
S06E09,KRAMER,Sold. Follow me into the dressing room.
S06E09,BANIA,You throw the shirt in?
S06E09,KRAMER,"Bania, you're killing me."
S06E09,BANIA,Hey that's the women's dressing room.
S06E09,KRAMER,There's nothing in there that I haven't seen before.
S06E09,GEORGE,"(Opens the door, looks in and then knocks 5 times) Mr. Steinbrenner, (waves) can I talk to you for a second?"
S06E09,STEINBRENNER,Yes yes George. Can you talk to me for a second? Of course you can -- Im a very accessible man. I just wanted to say you're doing great work on that Canola oil stuff.
S06E09,GEORGE,"Well, you know, to be honest sir -- my, my new secretary Ade, came up with that one."
S06E09,STEINBRENNER,"Ade, Ade, I like that name George."
S06E09,GEORGE,She supports her whole family. (walking slowly into the room)
S06E09,STEINBRENNER,Is that a fact George?
S06E09,GEORGE,"Yes, In fact, her mother is in the hospital right now. It's some kind of a Diverticulitis. (he continues walking slowly towards Steinbrenners desk)"
S06E09,STEINBRENNER,I had a bout of that myself one time -- knocked me right on my ass.
S06E09,GEORGE,She cant even afford to go out to lunch. She's been eating in a high school cafeterias She pretends to be a teacher. It's pathetic.
S06E09,STEINBRENNER,"What's that cost her, like, two and a quarter? ($2.25)"
S06E09,GEORGE,You know what I was just thinking -- she could really use a raise.
S06E09,STEINBRENNER,"You know, she'd be better off making a sandwich at home and bringing it in. (picks up the telephone hand set) Hello, ah, George will you excuse me."
S06E09,KRAMER,Psst. Hey.
S06E09,ELAINE,"Kramer, what are you doing here?"
S06E09,KRAMER,"Listen, I need you to get me some clothes."
S06E09,ELAINE,What?
S06E09,KRAMER,"Yeah, I just sold my suit to Bania for a cool three-hundred."
S06E09,ELAINE,So go buy a new one.
S06E09,KRAMER,"What, at this place? It would destroy my whole profit margin."
S06E09,ELAINE,So.
S06E09,KRAMER,"Listen do me a favor -- just call Jerry, tell him to bring me some clothes."
S06E09,ELAINE,Ouhhh (Kramer disappears back behind his wall as Elaine opens the dressing room door)
S06E09,JERRY,"Hello, Willie."
S06E09,WILLIE,"Hey, Jerry. You dropping off?"
S06E09,JERRY,"No, but ah, seen any good movies lately?"
S06E09,WILLIE,You came by to ask that?
S06E09,JERRY,"Yeah. Specifically 930 shows. Seen any good 930 shows at the Paragon, Willie?"
S06E09,WILLIE,What are you gettin at?
S06E09,JERRY,I saw you the other night stepping out with my Hounds-Tooth jacket.
S06E09,WILLIE,Jerry that's a breach of the dry-cleaners code.
S06E09,JERRY,You need a code to tell you not to wear peoples clothes
S06E09,WILLIE,I wasn't wearing your jacket. Jerry you're imagining things. (he makes the circular motion next to his ears - the international symbol for insane)
S06E09,JERRY,"Yeahhh, am I imagining this? (he whips out the movie stub and holds it up to Willie) Found this little cutie in the pocket. (throws the stub on the counter)"
S06E09,WILLIE,Jerry.
S06E09,JERRY,"Yeah, Yeah. Well, now that we understand each other -- Ill be taking my business elsewhere. And I want my mother's fur coat back too."
S06E09,WILLIE,"Jerry, come on."
S06E09,JERRY,Now.
S06E09,WILLIE,Now? (Willie looks off with his eyes to his left -- he is thinking about his wife Donna)
S06E09,JERRY,"Yeah. I want that coat. (Jerry opens his wallet, looking for the dry-cleaning ticket)"
S06E09,WILLIE,Well ... ahh. (apprehensively)
S06E09,JERRY,"Where's that ticket? Oh, Kramer."
S06E09,WILLIE,"Wait, you, you mean to tell me you don't have a ticket for the coat?"
S06E09,JERRY,"No, not on me."
S06E09,WILLIE,"Well, I, I need to see that ticket."
S06E09,JERRY,Why? I've got my cleaning before without a ticket.
S06E09,WILLIE,"Yeah, but this is different. Those fur storage warehouses are huge. You cant, get anything without a number."
S06E09,JERRY,"All right, Ill be back."
S06E09,ELAINE,"Yeah it looks good here, but what does that mean?"
S06E09,BARNEY'S SALES ASSOCIATE,"So, uh, do you want it?"
S06E09,ELAINE,"I don't know, I have to think about it. (the sales associate walks away) I need a nonpartisan mirror."
S06E09,ADE,"I cant thank you enough, Mr. Costanza. Im so grateful"
S06E09,GEORGE,"Yes, well, I sat down with Mr. Steinbrenner. I told him you have been doing great work. I said that you deserved a raise, and if you didnt get it, that I, was leaving. (motions with both arms in a circular motion to his right)"
S06E09,ADE,It was just so generous.
S06E09,GEORGE,"Oh, well, don't worry about it -- he's got plenty of money. (spins his chair away from her)"
S06E09,ADE,"Oh I know, but Twenty Five Thousand."
S06E09,GEORGE,"(spins his chair back to face her) So you got a $25,000 a year raise."
S06E09,ADE,"Yes, I tell you, Mr. Steinbrenner..."
S06E09,GEORGE,You're making more than I am.
S06E09,ADE,I am?
S06E09,GEORGE,What are you doing? You're making more than I am. A secretary cannot make more than her boss.
S06E09,ADE,Well apparently they can.
S06E09,ELAINE,"Oh, this is insanity. Im not this hippie. (meaning her hips are not that large)"
S06E09,ELAINE,"Hey, what do you think of this?"
S06E09,MAN,(with disbelief) You'll never pull it off.
S06E09,FEMALE CUSTOMER,"Hey, what's going on in there?"
S06E09,JERRY,"(to the Barneys sales associate) Excuse me, could you tell me where I could find, like, women's moisturizer lotions?"
S06E09,FEMALE CUSTOMER,This woman has been in there for over an hour.
S06E09,BARNEY'S SALES ASSOCIATE,"Excuse me Miss., Is everything ok in there?"
S06E09,KRAMER,[Yeah] (through the door)
S06E09,JERRY,Kramer?
S06E09,KRAMER,"Oh, Jerry, you got my clothes?"
S06E09,JERRY,What clothes?
S06E09,KRAMER,Didnt Elaine call you?
S06E09,JERRY,No.
S06E09,KRAMER,Well what are you doing here?
S06E09,JERRY,What am I doing here? You're in the women's dressing room. I need that ticket stub back so I can get my mother's fur coat out.
S06E09,KRAMER,"Oh, the stub, yeah. I left it in my, my pants"
S06E09,JERRY,Where are your pants?
S06E09,KRAMER,"Well, I sold them to Bania."
S06E09,JERRY,What? You sold your pants to Bania. Let me in.
S06E09,JERRY,Why'd you sell your pants to Bania?
S06E09,KRAMER,ouhhh -- I had Uma Thermans number written on that stub. I lost Umas number.
S06E09,JERRY,Where are your clothes?
S06E09,KRAMER,I told you I sold them to Bania.
S06E09,JERRY,You mean what you were wearing?
S06E09,KRAMER,Yeah.
S06E09,JERRY,How'd you expect to get out of here?
S06E09,KRAMER,"Well, I didnt think ahead."
S06E09,ELAINE,This isn't going to work for me ... so if you could show me something else.
S06E09,BARNEY'S SALES ASSOCIATE,No.
S06E09,ELAINE,No?
S06E09,BARNEY'S SALES ASSOCIATE,"No, because you're taking that one."
S06E09,ELAINE,I am?
S06E09,BARNEY'S SALES ASSOCIATE,Yes. Because you wore it out of the store.
S06E09,ELAINE,Ha! That's preposterous.
S06E09,BARNEY'S SALES ASSOCIATE,I suppose that salt stain came from all the snow in the store.
S06E09,BARNEY'S SALES ASSOCIATE,Shall I wrap it or will you wear it out?
S06E09,ELAINE,"No. You can wrap it. (Dejected. Elaine puts her head down and her hand to her forehead as she walks into the dressing room area) Kramer, are you still in there?"
S06E09,JERRY,[Elaine]
S06E09,ELAINE,Jerry?
S06E09,BANIA,"Elaine, where's Kramer?"
S06E09,KRAMER,Bania?
S06E09,BANIA,Kramer.
S06E09,JERRY,"Im going out. (he comes out of the dressing room, while Kramer remains inside)"
S06E09,BANIA,Jerry.
S06E09,JERRY,Bania.
S06E09,BANIA,"Kramer, I want my money back for this suit. You're nancy-boy cream leaked all over the pockets -- Suits ruined."
S06E09,KRAMER,"Well you're not getting any money back. (Kramer opens the door) Jerry, come back in here."
S06E09,JERRY,(to Bania) Excuse me. (he goes back in the dressing room)
S06E09,KRAMER,Umas number is on that ticket.
S06E09,JERRY,"Never mind Uma, I need that ticket to get my mother's fur coat back. Why don't you just give him the money for the suit?"
S06E09,KRAMER,Im not going to give him $300 now for a suit with moisturizer cream all over it.
S06E09,JERRY,I got an idea.
S06E09,KRAMER,What?
S06E09,JERRY,I cant believe Im gonna do this. (Jerry opens the door and exits the dressing room. He walks over to Bania)
S06E09,JERRY,Bania can I talk to you for a second? How's everything going?
S06E09,BANIA,Pretty good.
S06E09,JERRY,"Yeah, well, see the thing of it is, Im in a bit of an awkward position here. Because, uhh, I don't want to get in between you two guys but ... I need a dry-cleaning ticket that's in the pocket of those pants."
S06E09,BANIA,"Well all you gotta do is tell Kramer to give me my money back, and you'll get your ticket."
S06E09,JERRY,"Yeah, yeah all right, well uh ... tell you what I will do Bania -- you give me the ticket, and uh, I will take you out for a nice dinner."
S06E09,BANIA,Can we go back to Mendys?
S06E09,JERRY,"You want to go to Mendys, Ill take you to Mendys."
S06E09,BANIA,Twice? I wanna go twice.
S06E09,JERRY,"all right lets be reasonable, Bania. Im taking you out for a nice dinner. All I want is a little ticket in that pocket. I think it's a pretty good deal."
S06E09,BANIA,Two Mendys.
S06E09,JERRY,. . . All right (gritting teeth) Just give me the ticket.
S06E09,BANIA,Here you go.
S06E09,JERRY,Ohh ... (takes the ticket and heads for the dressing room)
S06E09,GEORGE,"But Mr. Steinbrenner, how can I be expected to perform my job properly, knowing that my uh, subordinate is making more money than I am? With all due respect sir, it's outta whack."
S06E09,STEINBRENNER,"Uh huh, I understand what you're saying George and I know what it's like to be financially strapped. When I was a young man in Cleveland I use to hitchhike to work. One time I got picked up by a bakery truck. You think that stuff smells good? Try being cooped up in the back of one of those babies."
S06E09,STEINBRENNER,I couldn't look at a donut for the next two years. Well not that I was ever one for the sweets.
S06E09,STEINBRENNER,"Sure I like a cup cake every now and then, like everybody else. You know I like it when they have a little cream on the inside, it's a surprise. That's good, plus the chocolate ones are good too. Sometimes I just cant even make up my mind. A lot of times Ill mix the two together, make a vanilla fudge."
S06E09,JERRY,"Let me in, it's me. (Kramer opens the door, Jerry goes in the dressing room) Here. You don't know what this is costing me. (hands Kramer the ticket)"
S06E09,KRAMER,"(closes the door) All right, nice work. (he looks at the ticket, flips it over, and then over again) Where's Umas number? The moisturizer smudged out the phone number."
S06E09,JERRY,"(Takes the ticket back and looks at it, flips it over) The dry-cleaning numbers are gone too."
S06E09,KRAMER,(grabs the ticket back and holds it up to the light) It must have been the botanical extracts.
S06E09,JERRY,(grabs the ticket back) Give me that.
S06E09,JERRY,"Hey Bania, the dinners off. The ticket's no good. The numbers are all smudged out. (holds out the ticket and hands it to Bania)"
S06E09,BANIA,(looking at the ticket then quickly looks up at Jerry) You trying to get out of Mendys? you cant do that.
S06E09,JERRY,The ticket is worthless.
S06E09,BANIA,You promised me.
S06E09,JERRY,"Hey, Isn't that my mother's fur coat?"
S06E09,DONNA,No it's not. (the coat)
S06E09,JERRY,It is! (Jerry walks forcefully into the dressing room and closes the door) Give me that back.
S06E09,DONNA,"No, what are you talking about."
S06E09,DONNA,Are you out of your mind? Don't you ... take your hands ...
S06E09,JERRY,"You cant have that coat, it's not yours."
S06E09,JERRY,What do you think the dry-cleaners is your own personal closet!
S06E09,ELAINE,"Donna, do you think you can get the salt stain out of this?"
S06E09,DONNA,Let me see. (Looking at the stain) Piece of cake. Bring it
S06E09,ELAINE,"(Tilts her head down, looking over her glasses in amazement of"
S06E09,BANIA,Mmm. This soup is great.
S06E09,JERRY,"Yeah, it's very good. (reluctantly)"
S06E09,BANIA,"I told you Mendys had the best pea soup. The best Jerry, the best. Are you enjoying it?"
S06E09,JERRY,Yeah. Im having a wonderful time. (it's obvious he isn't)
S06E09,BANIA,"Wait till you try the swordfish. You know Jerry, I was thinking. For our next meal, do you think we should come here ... or should we go someplace else? You know it has it's pros and cons. On the one hand, here, you're guaranteed a great meal. On the other hand --"
S06E09,JERRY,"(Interrupting Bania) Yeah, yeah I know. This would be good, but it would be the same. But if we go some place else, it would be different, but it might not be as good. It's a gamble. I get it."
S06E09,BANIA,"Yeah. Well, lets hurry up and eat I gotta get out of here. Im meeting a woman for a drink."
S06E09,JERRY,"Oh, and who might that be?"
S06E09,BANIA,Some woman named Uma. I got her number off of that ticket before it was smudged. Hope she's good-looking. (crosses his fingers in the air)
S06E09,JERRY,"If you are a waitress and you ever see me in a restaurant, Im telling you right now, I don't want to hear about the specials. I don't want to know about the specials. Im sick of the specials. I hate the specials. My feeling is, if the specials were so special, they'd be on the menu. You know what's special about them? They don't know if anybody likes them. They always have these overly creative descriptions of the specials too, you know. The veil is lightly slapped, and then sequestered in a one-bedroom suite with a white wine intravenous."
S06E10,JERRY,Ready to go Lois?
S06E10,LOIS,You really like to say my name? Don't you?
S06E10,JERRY,Excuse me Lois. Stand back Lois. Jimmy's in trouble Lois.
S06E10,LOIS,"Oh, Mr. Meyers this is my friend, Jerry."
S06E10,DUNCAN,Jerry Seinfeld!
S06E10,JERRY,Duncan Meyers!
S06E10,LOIS,You two know each other?
S06E10,DUNCAN,"Yeah! We uh, went to High School together. Didn't we Jerry? Gee I hope you're not leaving now. We still have a lot of work left to do."
S06E10,LOIS,Would you be able to come all the way downtown again in rush hour to pick me up?
S06E10,JERRY,"Well, I'd have to be Superman to do that Lois."
S06E10,ELAINE,"No, no This is all wrong. Where's the Chicken Cashew?"
S06E10,LEW,You no order Chicken Cashew.
S06E10,ELAINE,I didn't order any of this. I'm not paying for this.
S06E10,LEW,Fine Benes. We are putting you on our list.
S06E10,ELAINE,What list?
S06E10,LEW,"The ""do not deliver"" list."
S06E10,ELAINE,"MERRY CHRISTMAS TO YOU! Well, I guess we'll just go out."
S06E10,GEORGE,Yeah. What are you doing with the Daily Worker?
S06E10,ELAINE,Ned must have left it here.
S06E10,GEORGE,Your boyfriend reads the Daily Worker? What is he? A communist?
S06E10,ELAINE,"HE reads everything, you know, Ned's very well read."
S06E10,GEORGE,"Maybe he's just ""very well RED""?"
S06E10,ELAINE,Communist? Don't you think he probably would have told me?
S06E10,GEORGE,"Well, does he wear bland, drab, olive colored clothing?"
S06E10,ELAINE,"Yes, . . . yes he does dress a little drab."
S06E10,GEORGE,"Huh, he's a communist. . . . Look at this. ""Exciting uninhibited woman seeks forward thinking comrade and appearance not important."" . . . Appearance Not Important! This is unbelievable. Finally this is an ideology I can embrace."
S06E10,JERRY,Hi oh.
S06E10,ELAINE & GEORGE,Hey.
S06E10,ELAINE,Where's Lois?
S06E10,JERRY,She couldn't make it.
S06E10,GEORGE,I can't believe you're really going out with a woman named Lois.
S06E10,JERRY,"I know, finally. But George, guess who her boss is. Duncan Meyers."
S06E10,GEORGE,Duncan Meyers?
S06E10,ELAINE,Who's he?
S06E10,JERRY,"Elaine, only one other person in the world knows what I am about to tell you and that's George. When we were in the ninth grade they had us all line up at one end of the school yard for this big race to see who was going to represent the school in this track meet."
S06E10,ELAINE,Uh uh
S06E10,JERRY,"I was the last one on the end. George was next to me. And Mr. Bevilacqua, the gym . . ."
S06E10,ELAINE,What's that?
S06E10,JERRY,"Mr. Bevilacqua, the gym teacher."
S06E10,ELAINE,"Oh, of course."
S06E10,JERRY,"He was down at the other end. So he yells out, ""Ready, On your mark, Get set, "" and I was so keyed up I just took off. By the time he said go I was ten yards ahead of everybody."
S06E10,ELAINE,No.
S06E10,GEORGE,I looked up. I couldn't believe it.
S06E10,JERRY,By the time the race was over I had won. I was shocked nobody had noticed the head start.
S06E10,ELAINE,Really?
S06E10,JERRY,And I had won by so much a myth began to grow about my speed. Only Duncan suspected something was a miss. He's hated me ever since. Now he's back.
S06E10,ELAINE,Well what happened when you raced him again?
S06E10,JERRY,I never did. In four years of high school I would never race anyone again. Not even to the end of the block to catch a bus. And so the legend grew. Everyone wanted me to race. They begged me. The track coach called my parents. Pleading. Telling them it was a sin to waste my god given talent. But I answered him in the same way I answered everyone. I chose not to run.
S06E10,ELAINE,So now Duncan is back?
S06E10,JERRY,He's back. And I knew he would be someday. (drinks) Man that's some tart cider!
S06E10,LOIS,Hi.
S06E10,JERRY,Hi.
S06E10,LOIS,Sorry I missed the Chinese food.
S06E10,JERRY,"Oh, so am I . Uh, how's Duncan?"
S06E10,LOIS,He's okay.
S06E10,JERRY,He say anything?
S06E10,LOIS,About what?
S06E10,JERRY,"Oh, nothing in particular."
S06E10,LOIS,. . . Why did you cheat in that race?
S06E10,JERRY,I did not cheat.
S06E10,LOIS,He said that you got a head start.
S06E10,JERRY,"Oh, he's just jealous because he came in second."
S06E10,LOIS,Really?
S06E10,JERRY,Yes
S06E10,LOIS,So you WERE the fastest kid in school.
S06E10,JERRY,Faster than a speeding bullet Lois.
S06E10,ELAINE,"So how was work? Another day, another dollar?"
S06E10,NED,I guess.
S06E10,ELAINE,Oh well nothing wrong with that. Gotta make those big bucks. . . . money money money money money money money . . . ha ha ha ha ah . . . are you a communist?
S06E10,NED,"Yes, as a matter of fact I am."
S06E10,ELAINE,"OH, AH! OH! WOW! WHOA! A COMMIE! Wow, gee, man it must be a bummer for you guys what with the fall of the soviet empire and everything ."
S06E10,NED,"Yeah, well, we still got China, and Cuba,"
S06E10,ELAINE,"Yeah, but come on . . ."
S06E10,NED,I know it's not the same.
S06E10,ELAINE,"Well, you had a good run, what was it 75, 80 years? Wreaking havoc, making everybody nervous."
S06E10,NED,"Yeah, we had a good run."
S06E10,ELAINE,"Well, so enjoy yourself. (clink glasses) ha ha uh ha"
S06E10,GEORGE,So you lied to her?
S06E10,JERRY,I couldnt tell her the truth. I don't know what's going to happen between us. What if we have a bad breakup. She'll go straight to Duncan. And I want him to go to his grave never being certain I got that
S06E10,ELAINE,"Well, I'm dating a communist."
S06E10,JERRY,"Wow, a communist. That's something."
S06E10,ELAINE,"Yeah, that's pretty cool isn't it?"
S06E10,GEORGE,"Hey, did I tell you I called one of those girls from the personal ads in The Daily Worker?"
S06E10,JERRY,The Daily Worker has personal ads?
S06E10,GEORGE,And they say appearance is not important.
S06E10,JERRY,Yours or hers?
S06E10,KRAMER,Ho Ho Ho Ho Ho Merry Christmas everyone. Merry Christmas.
S06E10,JERRY,"Wow, look at you. So you got the job."
S06E10,KRAMER,"Yeah, you're looking at the new Santa at Coleman's Department store."
S06E10,ELAINE,"Oh, congratulations"
S06E10,MICKEY,Come on get your bead on. We're going to be late.
S06E10,KRAMER,"On Prancer on Dasher, on Donna."
S06E10,MICKEY,"Not Donna, it's Donner."
S06E10,KRAMER,Donna!
S06E10,MICKEY,"Yeah, right!. On Prancer, on Dancer, on Donna, on Ethyl, on Harriet."
S06E10,JERRY,"Hello, Oh hi Lois, you want to get together, what for? I don't know about that, I'll have to think about it. I'll let you know. Okay, bye."
S06E10,GEORGE,What's up?
S06E10,JERRY,Duncan wants to get together with her and me for lunch tomorrow. He obviously wants me to admit I got a head start. And I don't think she believes me.
S06E10,GEORGE,He wants to meet you? I'll tell you what. I'll show up. He doesn't know we're friends. I'll pretend I haven't seen you since High School. I'll back up the story.
S06E10,JERRY,That's not bad.
S06E10,GEORGE,Not bad? It's gorgeous!
S06E10,KRAMER,"Ho ho ho Well come on little Princess, tell Santa what you want. Don't be shy."
S06E10,MOM,She doesn't speak English (with a Swedish accent).
S06E10,KRAMER,Santa speaks the language of all children. A notchie watchie dotchie do.
S06E10,KRAMER,"A dotchie cotchie dochie,"
S06E10,KRAMER,"Het, Mickey when do we get a break? My lap is killing me."
S06E10,MICKEY,There is no break.
S06E10,KRAMER,A sweat shop.
S06E10,KRAMER,"Hey, hey, hey."
S06E10,ADA,Natalie on line 2.
S06E10,GEORGE,Natalie?
S06E10,ADA,From the Daily Worker.
S06E10,GEORGE,Thank you.
S06E10,GEORGE,"Hello, it's Natalie? Yeah, this is a business office but I'm not a business man per se. I'm here working for the people. Yes, I'm causing dissent. Stirring the pot. Getting people to question the whole rotten system."
S06E10,ILENE,Elaine.
S06E10,ELAINE,Ilene.
S06E10,ILENE,Hi.
S06E10,ELAINE,Hello.
S06E10,ILENE,Doing a little Christmas shopping?
S06E10,ELAINE,"Yeah, yeah. Oh, this is Ned. He's a communist."
S06E10,ILENE,"Oh, really?"
S06E10,ELAINE,"Yep . . . a big communist, a big big communist."
S06E10,ILENE,"Oh, well, it's awfully nice to see you. See you later."
S06E10,ELAINE,Bye bye
S06E10,ELAINE,"Hey, listen while we're here why don't we do a little shirt shopping?"
S06E10,NED,Out of the question.
S06E10,ELAINE,Um. Kramer!
S06E10,KRAMER,Hi
S06E10,ELAINE,"Hi, oh hi Mickey, this is Ned"
S06E10,KRAMER,"Oh, hey, hi buddy."
S06E10,ELAINE,"You guys stay here, I'll be right back."
S06E10,KRAMER,"Eight hours of jingle belling and ho ho hoing. Boy, I am ho'd out."
S06E10,NED,Anyone who works here is a sap.
S06E10,MICKEY,Watch it!
S06E10,KRAMER,"Woah, woah, come on."
S06E10,NED,You understand the Santa's at Bloomfields are making double what you are?
S06E10,KRAMER,Double?
S06E10,NED,I bet the beard itches doesn't it?
S06E10,KRAMER,You got that straight.
S06E10,NED,So when you get a rash all over your face in January do you think Coleman's will be there with a medical plan?
S06E10,MICKEY,"Look, you take that commie crap out into the street."
S06E10,NED,"Kramer, I've got some literature in my car that will change your whole way of thinking."
S06E10,KRAMER,Talk to me baby.
S06E10,MICKEY,"Don't listen to him Kramer, you've got a good job here."
S06E10,DUNCAN,But there's no way you could have beaten me by that much. I already beaten you in Junior High School three times.
S06E10,JERRY,"I didn't hit puberty til the 9th grade. That's what gave me my speed. Besides, if I got a head start why didn't Mr. Bevilacqua stop the race?"
S06E10,DUNCAN,That's what I've always wondered about.
S06E10,JERRY,"Well, I . . . [sees George]"
S06E10,GEORGE,"Oh, my God, No, oh my God, . . . Jerry!"
S06E10,JERRY,"I'm sorry, uh,"
S06E10,GEORGE,"George, George Costanza!"
S06E10,JERRY,"Oh, George Costanza , Kennedy High."
S06E10,GEORGE,Yes yes yes This is unbelievable.
S06E10,DUNCAN,"Hi, George"
S06E10,GEORGE,"Oh, wait a minute, wait a minute, don't tell me, don't tell me. It starts with a . . . Duncan Meyers. Oh, wow, this is something. I haven't seen you guys in what, twenty years?"
S06E10,JERRY,This is Lois.
S06E10,LOIS,Hello.
S06E10,GEORGE,So what have you been doing with yourself?
S06E10,JERRY,I'm I'm a comedian.
S06E10,GEORGE,"Ah ha, well, I really wouldn't know about that. I don't watch much TV. I like to read. So what do you do, a lot of that ""did you ever notice?"" this kind of stuff."
S06E10,JERRY,"Yeah, yeah"
S06E10,GEORGE,It strikes me a lot of guys are doing that kind of humor now.
S06E10,JERRY,"Yeah, yeah, Well, you really got bald there, didn't you?"
S06E10,GEORGE,"Yeah, yeah."
S06E10,JERRY,You really used to have a think full head of hair.
S06E10,GEORGE,"Yeah, yeah. Well, I guess I started losing it when I was about twenty-eight right around the time I made my first million. You know what they say. The first million is the hardest one."
S06E10,JERRY,"yeah, yeah."
S06E10,LOIS,What do you do?
S06E10,GEORGE,I'm an architect.
S06E10,LOIS,Have you designed any buildings in New York?
S06E10,GEORGE,Have you seen the new addition to the Guggenheim?
S06E10,LOIS,You did that?
S06E10,GEORGE,Yep. And it didn't take very long either.
S06E10,JERRY,Well you've really built yourself up into something.
S06E10,GEORGE,"Well, well, I had a dream, Jerry."
S06E10,JERRY,"Well, one cannot help[ but wonder what brings you into a crummy little coffee shop like this."
S06E10,GEORGE,"Well, I like to stay in touch with the people."
S06E10,JERRY,"Ah, you know you have a hole in your sneaker there. What is that canvas?"
S06E10,GEORGE,"You know my driver's waiting, I really should get running. Good to see you guys again."
S06E10,JERRY,"George, George, hang on. I haven't seen you in so long."
S06E10,GEORGE,"Ha, uh,"
S06E10,JERRY,I thought we might reminisce a little more. You know Duncan and I were just taking about the big race.
S06E10,GEORGE,"Oh, the big race."
S06E10,JERRY,Yeah.
S06E10,GEORGE,"Yes, yes,."
S06E10,LOIS,You were there?
S06E10,GEORGE,"Yes, sure, surely was. Yeah, I'll remember that day. Well I'll never forget it because that was the day that I uh, lost my virginity to Miss. Stafford, the uh, voluptuous home room teacher."
S06E10,DUNCAN,Miss Stafford?
S06E10,GEORGE,"Yes, yes, you know I was in detention and she came up behind me while I was erasing the blackboard . . ."
S06E10,JERRY,George!
S06E10,GEORGE,"But I digress. Let me see, now. You were standing at one end of the line and I was right next to you. And I remember we were even for like, the first five yards and then , BOOM,...You were gone."
S06E10,JERRY,Did I get a head start?
S06E10,GEORGE,"Head start, oh no absolutely not."
S06E10,JERRY,You satisfied? So you see?
S06E10,DUNCAN,"No, I'm still not convinced and I never will be."
S06E10,LOIS,Why don't the two of you just race again?
S06E10,DUNCAN,That's a good idea.
S06E10,JERRY,"No, no, no, another race - out of the question."
S06E10,DUNCAN,"I know, you've been saying that for twenty years because you know you can't beat me. You couldn't beat me then and you can't beat me now."
S06E10,LOIS,Race him Jerry. Race him.
S06E10,JERRY,All right! I'll do it. The race is on.
S06E10,ELAINE,. . . shut up! (?)
S06E10,JERRY,And he's calling all these people from High School to come and watch. I knew this day would come. I can't do it. I can't go through with it. I'm calling it off. I can't let the legend die. It's like a kid finding out there's no Santa Claus
S06E10,KRAMER,"Each according to his ability, to each according to his needs."
S06E10,MICKEY,What does that mean?
S06E10,KRAMER,"Well, if you've got needs and abilities that's a pretty good combination."
S06E10,MICKEY,So what if I want to open up a delicatessen?
S06E10,KRAMER,There are no delicatessens under Communism.
S06E10,MICKEY,Why not?
S06E10,KRAMER,"Well, because the meats are divided into a class system. You got Pastrami and Corned Beef in one class and Salami and Bologna in another. That's not right."
S06E10,MICKEY,So you can't get Corned Beef?
S06E10,KRAMER,"Well, you know, if you're in the Politburo, maybe."
S06E10,GEORGE,"(on phone) . It's George Costanza. . are there any messages for me? Why does Mr. Steinbrenner want to see me in his office? . . . Communist? I'm not a Communist . . . . All right, all right. All right, I'll be there. - ( hangs up ) My secretary Ada, told Mr Steinbrenner I'm a Communist Now he wants to see me in his office."
S06E10,JERRY,So you'll just explain to him you're not a Communist. You just called the woman for a date.
S06E10,JERRY,"Hello, oh hi Duncan, 400 o'clock tomorrow? That is not going to work. . . . Why? I'll tell you why. Because I chose not to run!"
S06E10,NED,I'm sorry Elaine. The shirt's too fancy.
S06E10,ELAINE,"Just because you're a communist, does that mean you can't wear anything nice? You look like Trotsky. It's gorgeous. Fine, you want to be a Communist, be a Communist. Can't you at least look like a successful Communist?"
S06E10,NED,"All right, I'll try it on."
S06E10,ELAINE,I'm going to order Chinese Food.
S06E10,NED,"You're ordering from Hop Sing's, right?"
S06E10,ELAINE,"Ugh, does it have to be Hop Sing's. I kind of had a fight with him."
S06E10,NED,"Elaine, when my father was black listed he couldn't work for years. He and his friends used to sit at Hop Sing's every day figuring out how to survive."
S06E10,ELAINE,You're father was blacklisted?
S06E10,NED,"Yes he was, and you know why? Because he was betrayed by people he trusted. They ""named names""."
S06E10,ELAINE,"Okay, okay. (phones) Um, yeah, hi, I'd like delivery please to 16 West 75th St. apartment 2G."
S06E10,LEW,"I know that address. You're Benes, right. You're on our list. No more delivery."
S06E10,ELAINE,"No. no, she doesn't live here anymore. This is someone else."
S06E10,LEW,"Oh, yeah. What's the name?"
S06E10,ELAINE,Why do you need the name? You already have the address.
S06E10,LEW,We need a name. Give us a name.
S06E10,ELAINE,"Okay, okay, Ned Isakoff."
S06E10,KID,I want a racing car set.
S06E10,KRAMER,"Ho ho ho ho A racing car set! Those are assembled in Tai Wan by kids like you. And these Coleman pigs, they sell it at triple the cost."
S06E10,KID,But I want a racing car set.
S06E10,KRAMER,"You see kid, you're being bamboozaled. These capatalist fat cats are inflating the profit margin and reducing your total number of toys."
S06E10,KID,"Hey, this guy's a COMMIE!"
S06E10,MICKEY,"Hey, kid, quiet. Were did a nice little boy like you learn such a bad word like that? Huh?"
S06E10,KID,"Commie, Commie, Commie . . . (unknown) ."
S06E10,MICKEY,Santa is not a Commie. He just forgot how his good friend stuck his neck out for him to get him a good job like this. Didn't he Santa!
S06E10,STORE MANAGER,Is there a problem here?
S06E10,KRAMER,ho ho ho ho.
S06E10,KID,This guy's a Commie. He's spreading propoganda.
S06E10,STORE MANAGER,Oh yeah? Well that's enough pinko! You're through. The both of ya'
S06E10,MICKEY,I got two kids in college.
S06E10,KRAMER,"You can't fire me, I'm Santa Claus."
S06E10,STORE MANAGER,Not anymore. Get your skinny ass out of here.
S06E10,JERRY,Hi how are you?
S06E10,LOIS,. . . Fine.
S06E10,JERRY,What's the matter?
S06E10,LOIS,"I just spoke to Duncan. He said if you don't race, he's going to fire me."
S06E10,JERRY,What? He can't do that.
S06E10,LOIS,Yes he can. He controls the means of production. What are you going to do Jerry?
S06E10,JERRY,Don't worry Lois. I'll think of something.
S06E10,LEW,"Ah, I knew it was you! You tried to trick Hop Sing! You are onour list; Elaine Benes! And now you are on our list; Ned Isakoff."
S06E10,NED,You got me blacklisted from Hop Sing's?
S06E10,LEW,She named name!
S06E10,GEORGE,"You, uh, wanted to see me, Mr. Steinbrenner?"
S06E10,STEINBRENNER,"Yes George, I did. Come in, come in. George, the wordaround the office is that you're a Communist."
S06E10,GEORGE,"C-Communist? I am a Yankee, sir, first and foremost."
S06E10,STEINBRENNER,"You know George, it struck me today me that a Communistpipeline into the vast reservoir of Cuban baseball talent could be thegreatest thing ever to happen to this organization."
S06E10,GEORGE,Sir?
S06E10,STEINBRENNER,"You could be invaluable to this franchise. George, there's a southpaw down there nobody's been able to get a look at; something Rodriguez, I don't really know his name. You get yourselfdown to Havana right away."
S06E10,GEORGE,"Yes, sir. Yes sir, do my best."
S06E10,STEINBRENNER,"Good, Merry Christmas George. And bring me back some of those cigars in the cedar boxes, you know the ones with the fancy rings? I love those fancy rings. They kind of distract you while you're smoking. The red and yellow are nice. It looks good against the brown of the cigar. The Maduro, I like the Maduro wrapper. The darker the better, that's what I say. Of course, the Claro's good too. That's more of a pale brown, almost like a milky coffee. (George exits) I find the ring size very confusing. They have it in centimeters which I don't really understand that well..."
S06E10,MICKEY,"That was quick! Nice job, Santa!"
S06E10,KRAMER,"Yeah,"
S06E10,MICKEY,I knew that Commie stuff was going to get us in trouble.
S06E10,KRAMER,"Yeah, well I didn't realize that was such a sensitive issue."
S06E10,MICKEY,"Communism, You didn't realize Communism was a sensitive issue? What do you think has been going on in the world for the past 60 years? Wake up and smell the coffee."
S06E10,KRAMER,I guess I screwed up!
S06E10,MICKEY,You sure did. Big time.
S06E10,ELAINE,How do you feel?
S06E10,JERRY,I need a miracle.
S06E10,DUNCAN,Now you're going to see what kind of liar you're mixed up with.
S06E10,LOIS,If he beats you I want a big raise.
S06E10,DUNCAN,"If he beats me, I'll not only give you a raise, I'll send you to Hawaii for two weeks."
S06E10,KRAMER,I parked in front of that restaurant . As soon as this race is over I got to go to the airport.
S06E10,GEORGE,"Okay, all right, all right."
S06E10,MR. BEVILACQUA,You ready boys?
S06E10,JERRY,"Yes, Mr. Beviacqua"
S06E10,MR. BEVILACQUA,"Okay, this is hoiw it works. You take your marks, I say, READY - ON YOUR MARK - GET SET - and then fire. You got it?"
S06E10,DUNCAN & JERRY,Yes Mr. Bevilacqua.
S06E10,MR. BEVILACQUA,READY - ON YOUR MARK
S06E10,LOIS,So will you come to Hawaii with me Jerry?
S06E10,JERRY,"Maybe I will , Lois. Maybe I will."
S06E10,GEORGE,"You wanted to see me, El Presidente?"
S06E10,CASTRO,"Si, si. (a Spanish word I can't figure out) Come here. I understand you are very interested in one of our players, eh?"
S06E10,GEORGE,"Si, si."
S06E10,CASTRO,"Ordinarily I would not grant such a request but I've heard you are, uh, how you say, Communista simpatico, eh?"
S06E10,GEORGE,Muy sumpatico. Muy muy muy.
S06E10,CASTRO,"Well good, then you can have your pick."
S06E10,GEORGE,"Oh, oh!"
S06E10,CASTRO,They will play for your Yankees.
S06E10,GEORGE,"Oh well, gracias El Commandante, gracias. Muy muy."
S06E10,CASTRO,"And I would be honored if you would be my guest for dinner tonight at the Presidential palace. There will be girls there and, I hear, some pretty good food. Of course the problem with parties is you invariably have to eat standing up which I don't care for but on the other hand I don't like to balance a plate on my lap either. Once when I was at a party, I put my plate on someone's piano. I assure you, if I had not been a dictator, I would not have been able to get away with that one."
S06E11,JERRY,Come on. Lets go
S06E11,ELAINE,"No wait, I gotta go in here and pick up Mr. Pitt's tennis recquet."
S06E11,JERRY,What's it doin here?
S06E11,ELAINE,He wanted to have it restrung. (to clerk) Here I need to pick that up
S06E11,LANDIS,Hello
S06E11,ELAINE,"Oh, Hi."
S06E11,LANDIS,Jocylin Landis from Doubleday. I interviewed you for a position a couple of months ago.
S06E11,ELAINE,"Yes, yes, the one I didn't get. (they giggle)"
S06E11,LANDIS,I was watching you play
S06E11,ELAINE,"Oh, I'm not very good."
S06E11,LANDIS,No. You exhibited a lot of grace out there.
S06E11,ELAINE,Really? Grace?
S06E11,LANDIS,Yes. So have you found anything yet?
S06E11,ELAINE,"Uh, no. Not really."
S06E11,LANDIS,You know you should keep in touch. Something may be opening up in a few weeks. Is that a Bruline?
S06E11,JERRY,"Oh, Bruline. Newman's got the same one."
S06E11,ELAINE,Newman plays tennis?
S06E11,JERRY,He's fantastic.
S06E11,LANDIS,Would you mind if I tried this out?
S06E11,ELAINE,"Uh, no ... take it."
S06E11,LANDIS,How will you get it back?
S06E11,ELAINE,"Um, I could come by your office and pick it up tomorrow."
S06E11,LANDIS,That's so generous of you.
S06E11,ELAINE,Thanks
S06E11,JERRY,You loaned her Pitt's racquet?
S06E11,ELAINE,What could I do? She said there might be something for me at Doubleday. Oh wouldn't that be great I wouldn't have to work for Mr. Pitt anymore.
S06E11,SANDY,I gotta get going.
S06E11,JERRY,"Oh, OK. Next time lets play ping pong. It's easier to jump over the net."
S06E11,SANDY,(nods silently)
S06E11,ELAINE,Bye
S06E11,JERRY,Bye bye
S06E11,ELAINE,Have you noticed she never laughs
S06E11,JERRY,"Hm, really?"
S06E11,ELAINE,Yeah
S06E11,GEORGE,Check that out (showing newspaper)
S06E11,KRAMER,"Whoa, you're dating this woman?"
S06E11,GEORGE,That's right.
S06E11,KRAMER,"George, you're becoming one of the gliterratti"
S06E11,GEORGE,What's that.
S06E11,KRAMER,"Ya' know, people who glitter. She's a slim gal."
S06E11,GEORGE,And the amazing thing is she eats like there's no tomorra'. I mean I've never seen an appetite like this. Desserts. Everything. I don't know how she does it.
S06E11,KRAMER,Maybe she's bulimic
S06E11,GEORGE,Wa?
S06E11,KRAMER,"Bulimic,"
S06E11,GEORGE,"Kramer, she's a model."
S06E11,KRAMER,Exactly
S06E11,GEORGE,I have noticed she does tend to go to the bathroom right after we finish eating.
S06E11,KRAMER,There you go monkey boy.
S06E11,NINA,"Mmm, Mmmm oh, so good, mmm, mmm. Aren't you hungry?"
S06E11,GEORGE,Just enjoying watching you.
S06E11,SANDY,So did you like the movie?
S06E11,JERRY,"Yeah, it was OK. Frankenstein didn't seem quite right to me. I missed the sport jacket."
S06E11,SANDY,(nods silently)
S06E11,JERRY,Not that it was that nice of a jacket. I mean it didn't fit him that well. To me there's just something about a monster in a blazer. It shows at least he's making an effort.
S06E11,SANDY,(nods silently) That's funny.
S06E11,JERRY,I'm glad you enjoyed it.
S06E11,NINA,"Oh, I'm so full."
S06E11,GEORGE,"Yes, full. I love to be full ... love to sit back, loosen the old belt and digest away for hours. Let those enzymes do their work."
S06E11,NINA,Will you excuse me.
S06E11,GEORGE,Where you going?
S06E11,NINA,I just need to freshen up.
S06E11,GEORGE,You're fresh (grabs her arm) You're very fresh. You seem very fresh to me. You're very vital. I couldn't take you any fresher.
S06E11,NINA,"George I need to freshen., George, George, George ..."
S06E11,JERRY,It was unbelievable. You're right the jokes kept bouncing off her like superman.
S06E11,ELAINE,"See, what did I tell ya?"
S06E11,JERRY,"And even when she did like something, she doesn't laugh. She says, ""That's funny."" ... That's funny!"
S06E11,ELAINE,"Oo, I better call that woman at Doubleday and see when I can pick up Mr. Pitt's racquet."
S06E11,JERRY,I mean how can I be with someone that doesn't laugh. It's like ... well it's like something!
S06E11,ELAINE,"(on phone)Hello, yeah, hi. Uh, is Miss. Landis there please. Wa? Oh, Gosh, ah ok, she'll be in later? OK, thank you. Uh. (to Jerry) This guy said she hurt her arm playing tennis. ... Pretty bad."
S06E11,GEORGE,"Well, I heard a noise."
S06E11,JERRY,What noise?
S06E11,GEORGE,"You know, .. blah ..."
S06E11,JERRY,What blah?
S06E11,GEORGE,From the bathroom.
S06E11,JERRY,"Oh, you think she was refunding?"
S06E11,GEORGE,Every time we go out to eat the minute we we're done eating she's runnin to the bathroom.
S06E11,ELAINE,So you're concerned.
S06E11,GEORGE,"Elaine, of course I'm concerned. I'm payin' for those meals. It's like throwing money down the toilet."
S06E11,JERRY,In a manner of speaking.
S06E11,GEORGE,Let me digest it. Let me get my money's worth. Y'know what would be good is if there was someone else in the bathroom that could tell me.
S06E11,KRAMER,Here's your scrubber back.
S06E11,JERRY,Thanks.
S06E11,GEORGE,"Hey, maybe I could bribe one of those women that hand out the towels in the powder room."
S06E11,JERRY,A matron?
S06E11,GEORGE,Yeah
S06E11,JERRY,"uh, well I can't help you there (weakly)."
S06E11,GEORGE,Wha?
S06E11,KRAMER,Nothin'
S06E11,GEORGE,You know a matron?
S06E11,KRAMER,Me?
S06E11,GEORGE,You
S06E11,KRAMER,No.
S06E11,GEORGE,"Kramer,"
S06E11,KRAMER,"Well, now look, just leave me alone."
S06E11,GEORGE,"Well, what is it?"
S06E11,KRAMER,"No, don't, don't make me"
S06E11,GEORGE,Wha?
S06E11,KRAMER,"No, I can't, all right I can't ..."
S06E11,GEORGE,Who?
S06E11,KRAMER,... My mother's a matron!
S06E11,ELAINE,Babs?
S06E11,KRAMER,"Yeah, there, all right I said it there.. Ya' satisfied? Anything else you want to know?"
S06E11,GEORGE,"Kramer, Kramer, I need to know if Nina is refunding."
S06E11,KRAMER,"Look, George, I can't help ya, all right."
S06E11,GEORGE,Why not? Why not?
S06E11,KRAMER,let me go. let me go. Because I haven't talked to my mother in five years. We just don't see eye to eye. I don't even want to get into my childhood. I'm still carrying a lot of pain. A LOT of pain.
S06E11,GEORGE,"Come on, Kramer."
S06E11,KRAMER,I can't I can't
S06E11,JERRY,Kramer you're going to have to face her some time
S06E11,KRAMER,(mumbles) b'd b'd
S06E11,ELAINE,"Hello (sees Landis) Oh, my goodness. What happened?"
S06E11,LANDIS,I tore my umeral epicondilitist
S06E11,ELAINE,Oh
S06E11,LANDIS,My doctor said it might never fully heal. I may never play again.
S06E11,ELAINE,"Oh, you'll be playing ..."
S06E11,LANDIS,If I can't play tennis I don't know what I'll do.
S06E11,ELAINE,"There are plenty of things you can do, there's chess and uh uh mah jong,"
S06E11,LANDIS,You don't know how lucky you are to be healthy ...
S06E11,ELAINE,... and biking and ..
S06E11,LANDIS,What am I going to do?
S06E11,ELAINE,... hiking ...
S06E11,LANDIS,(wimpers)

S06E11,ELAINE,"(sees racquet), You know it's not important I'm gonna, ok, well, you know. Take care of that condolitis"
S06E11,KRAMER,Ma?

S06E11,GEORGE,Cosmo?
S06E11,JERRY,Why didn't you just ask her for it?
S06E11,ELAINE,I told you I couldn't. The woman was crying about how she might never play tennis again
S06E11,JERRY,Yeah
S06E11,GEORGE,Hey di ho
S06E11,JERRY,C'mon up.
S06E11,JERRY,So when do you have to get the racquet back to Mr. Pitt?
S06E11,ELAINE,"augh, he's got a big match tomorrow with Ethyl Kennedy"
S06E11,JERRY,He needs a three hundred-dollar Bruline to beat Ethyl Kennedy?
S06E11,ELAINE,He'll only play with his racquet
S06E11,JERRY,"Well, why don't you wait 'til she's not there on her lunch hour and just take it?"
S06E11,ELAINE,That's stealing?
S06E11,JERRY,Stealing? You loaned her the racquet!
S06E11,ELAINE,I know.
S06E11,GEORGE,Hey oh.
S06E11,ELAINE,JERRY Hey
S06E11,JERRY,So what happened with Kramer's mother?
S06E11,GEORGE,It's all worked out. Nina and I will have dinner Thursday at the restaurant where Babs works.
S06E11,JERRY,What's she like?
S06E11,GEORGE,"Oh, she's a Kramer. And uh, while I was there I uh happened to pick up another juicy little nugget about our friend."
S06E11,ELAINE,"Ah, I'm ready what?"
S06E11,JERRY,What is it?
S06E11,GEORGE,I uh got the first name.
S06E11,ELAINE,You found out Kramer's first name?
S06E11,GEORGE,That's right. You ready?
S06E11,JERRY,We've been trying to get it out of him for ten years. What is it?
S06E11,GEORGE,Cosmo

S06E11,ELAINE,COSMO?
S06E11,KRAMER,"All right, OK So you the name now. The cat is .a a a .. out of the bag."
S06E11,ELAINE,It's not such a bad name.
S06E11,KRAMER,Well you know all my life I've been running away from that name. That's why I wouldn't tell anybody. But I've been thinking about it. All this time I'm trying not to be me. I'm afraid to face who I was. But I'm Cosmo Jerry. I'm Cosmo Kramer. And that's who I'm going to be. From now on that's who I'm going to be. I'm Cosmo!
S06E11,LAURA,Yes?
S06E11,JERRY,"Hi, is Sandy here?"
S06E11,LAURA,"Hi, you must be Jerry. Sandy's in the shower. Do you want to come in?"
S06E11,JERRY,I would except I forgot to bring a towel.
S06E11,LAURA,(laughs nicely)
S06E11,JERRY,So the roommate laughed at everything I said.
S06E11,GEORGE,Wow.
S06E11,JERRY,"It was a great sounding laugh too, kind of lilting and feminine--none of those big coarse ""ha's."" You know those?"
S06E11,GEORGE,"Oh yeah HA-A-A, HA-A-A."
S06E11,JERRY,Yeah.
S06E11,GEORGE,"Hate the big coarse ""ha."" Hate those."
S06E11,JERRY,And the worst part of course is that she also possessed many of the other qualities prized by the Superficial Man.
S06E11,GEORGE,I see.
S06E11,JERRY,"So as you can see, I've got a bit of a problem here."
S06E11,GEORGE,"Well, if I hear you correctly--and I think that I do--my advice to you is to finish your meal, pay your check, leave here, and never mention this to anyone again."
S06E11,JERRY,"Can't be done, huh?"
S06E11,GEORGE,The Switch?
S06E11,JERRY,"""The Switch."""
S06E11,GEORGE,Can't be done.
S06E11,JERRY,I wonder.
S06E11,GEORGE,Do you realize in the entire history of western civilization no one has successfully accomplished the Roommate Switch? In the Middle Ages you could get locked up for even suggesting it!
S06E11,JERRY,They didn't have roommates in the Middle Ages.
S06E11,GEORGE,"Well, I'm sure at some point between the years 800 and 1200--somewhere--there were two women living together."
S06E11,JERRY,"The point is I intend to undertake this. And I'll do it with or without you. So if you're scared, if you haven't got the stomach for this, let's get it out right now! And I'll go on my own. If not, you can get on board and we can get to work! Now what's it going to be?"
S06E11,GEORGE,"All right, dammit, I'm in."
S06E11,JERRY,I couldn't do it without you.
S06E11,GEORGE,All right. Let's get to work.
S06E11,GEORGE,All right. That's enough for today. You're tired. Get some sleep. I'll see you first thing in the morning.
S06E11,JERRY,"Aw, we can't do it, who are we kidding? It's impossible! It's true! You can't do the Switch! Nobody can do the Switch! It was a stupid idea to begin with! Let's face it. I'm stuck with the non-laugher and that's that!"
S06E11,GEORGE,We'll come up with something.
S06E11,JERRY,"Yeah, sure we will."
S06E11,GEORGE,"All right. See you tomorrow. (George sighs, exits.)"
S06E11,GEORGE,I-I-I-I-I got it!!!!!
S06E11,GEORGE,"All right. Let's go over it again, one more time."
S06E11,JERRY,All right. So I tell Sandy that I want to have a mnage  trois with her and her roommate.
S06E11,GEORGE,That's right.
S06E11,JERRY,"And you believe this course of action will have a two-pronged effect. Firstly, the very mention of the idea will cause Sandy to recoil in disgust, whereupon she will insist that I remove myself from the premises."
S06E11,GEORGE,Keep going.
S06E11,JERRY,"At this point, it is inevitable that she will seek out the roommate to apprise her of this abhorrent turn of events."
S06E11,GEORGE,Continue.
S06E11,JERRY,The roommate will then offer her friend the requisite sympathy even as part of her cannot help but feel somewhat flattered by her inclusion in the unusual request.
S06E11,GEORGE,"A few days go by and a call is placed at a time when Sandy is known to be busy at work. Once the initial awkwardness is relieved with a little playful humor, which she [Laura] of course cannot resist, an invitation to a friendly dinner is proffered."
S06E11,JERRY,"Huh. Well, it all sounds pretty good. There's only one flaw in it They're roommates. She'd have to go out with me behind Sandy's back. She's not gonna do that."
S06E11,GEORGE,"You disappoint me, my friend. Sandy wants nothing to do with you. She tells Laura, ""If you want to waste your time with that pervert, that's your problem."""
S06E11,JERRY,It's a perfect plan. So inspired. So devious. Yet so simple.
S06E11,GEORGE,"(George, finger in the peanut butter jar) This is what I do."
S06E11,KEITH,Can I help you?
S06E11,ELAINE,"Uh, no, I'm OK."
S06E11,KEITH,Well then what are you doing with that racquet?
S06E11,ELAINE,"Um, it's mine. Miss. Landis borrowed it."
S06E11,KEITH,"Well, I'm sorry you can't take that, no no no.."
S06E11,ELAINE,"No no no, I can. I can. It's mine. It's my racquet."
S06E11,KEITH,Look sweetheart I don't know who you are. I don't know what you're doing here. But...
S06E11,ELAINE,All right. I'm going I'm going
S06E11,KEITH,Not with ...
S06E11,ELAINE,Give it give it ..
S06E11,KEITH,Leave ...
S06E11,ELAINE,All right all right forget it. You don't have to mention any of this to Miss. Landis do you?
S06E11,KEITH,I don't have to but I will.
S06E11,CLOTWORTHY,Morning Cosmo

S06E11,KRAMER,"Hey, everything my man."
S06E11,SANDY,What
S06E11,JERRY,"You know, I don't know the exact pronunciation but I believe its Manage A Trois."
S06E11,SANDY,"Oooo, that is a wild idea"
S06E11,JERRY,Uh?
S06E11,KRAMER,"You ma, know I've been thinking. I want you to quit that matron job."
S06E11,BABS,"Yes, well isn't that just easy for you to say. What the hell do you think I'm going to do with myself?"
S06E11,KRAMER,Well maybe we could go into business together. If you're clean?
S06E11,BABS,I've been clean for two years. Anyway what would we do together?
S06E11,KRAMER,I've got plenty of ideas.
S06E11,BABS,I've always believed in you Cosmo. You know that. So I want you to call that place today and tell then tha you're through.
S06E11,BABS,All right. I'll do it.
S06E11,NINA,Mmmm mm so good.
S06E11,GEORGE,... so glad.
S06E11,NINA,Will you excuse me I've got to freshen up.
S06E11,GEORGE,And why shouldn't you? Be fresh Stay fresh
S06E11,WOMAN,I'll be back. I'm not feeling very well.
S06E11,WAITRESS,Care to see our dessert menu?
S06E11,GEORGE,"Uh, yeah. Do you know Babs?"
S06E11,WAITRESS,"Oh, yeah I was sorry to hear she left."
S06E11,GEORGE,Babs left?
S06E11,WAITRESS,She quit today.
S06E11,GEORGE,Ah Ha.
S06E11,NINA,What are you doing here George?
S06E11,GEORGE,I was just wondering what it was you wanted for dessert.
S06E11,GEORGE,How 'ya feelin'?
S06E11,BABS,Hi Newman
S06E11,NEWMAN,Hi Babs
S06E11,BABS,What are you doin'
S06E11,NEWMAN,Minding my own business.
S06E11,BABS,You'll never get into trouble that way.
S06E11,NEWMAN,What makes you think I'm lookin' for trouble?
S06E11,BABS,From what I hear you postmen don't have to look too far.
S06E11,NEWMAN,ha ha ha Well you know sometimes it just has a way of finding you. Cigarette?
S06E11,BABS,Don't mind if I do.
S06E11,JERRY,Hey
S06E11,GEORGE,What happened to Babs. She never showed up last night. The whole thing blew up in my face.
S06E11,JERRY,"Ah, that's a shame."
S06E11,GEORGE,"Hey, what happened with Sandy. I forgot all about it. Did you call her?"
S06E11,JERRY,"Yeah, I did. In fact I went over there."
S06E11,GEORGE,So what happened? She throw you out? Eh?
S06E11,JERRY,"No actually, she took it pretty well."
S06E11,GEORGE,So what happened?
S06E11,JERRY,She's into it.
S06E11,GEORGE,Into what?
S06E11,JERRY,The manage. And not only that. She just called me and said she talked to the roommate and the roomate's into the manage too.
S06E11,GEORGE,That's unbelievable.
S06E11,JERRY,"Oh, it's a scene man."
S06E11,GEORGE,Do you ever just get down on your knees and thank god that you know me and have access to my dementia?
S06E11,JERRY,What are you talking about? I'm not goin' to do it.
S06E11,GEORGE,"You're not goin to do it? What do you mean, You're not goin to do it?"
S06E11,JERRY,I can't. I'm not an orgy guy.
S06E11,GEORGE,Are you crazy? This is like discovering Plutonium ... by accident.
S06E11,JERRY,"Don't you know what it means to become an orgy guy? It changes everything. I'd have to dress different. I'd have to act different. I'd have to grow a mustache and get all kinds of robes and lotions and I'd need a new bedspread and new curtains I'd have to get thick carpeting and weirso lighting. I'd have to get new friends. I'd have to get orgy friends. ... Naw, I'm not ready for it."
S06E11,GEORGE,If only something like that could happen to me.
S06E11,JERRY,"Oh, shut up you couldn't do it either."
S06E11,GEORGE,I know.
S06E11,JERRY,"Hey, what happened? Did you get your racquet?"
S06E11,ELAINE,"No, I got caught."
S06E11,JERRY,What do you mean you got caught?
S06E11,ELAINE,Her assistant caught me. And now I'm probably not going to get a job. He's going to tell Landis that I was sneakin around her office.
S06E11,JERRY,I still don't understand how you can get in trouble for taking your own racquet.
S06E11,ELAINE,Meanwhile Mr. Pitt's got this match with Ethyl Kennedy this afternoon.
S06E11,KRAMER,Hey.
S06E11,JERRY,Hi Cosmo.
S06E11,ELAINE,Hi Cosmo
S06E11,KRAMER,Thanks man.
S06E11,JERRY,"Hey, doesn't Newman have a Bruline racquet?"
S06E11,KRAMER,"Uh, Yeah, yeah, but he's on vacation. Went to Baltimore."
S06E11,JERRY,"Hum, but you've got the key to his place right?"
S06E11,KRAMER,Yeah
S06E11,JERRY,Well Elaine needs to borrow his racquet. Just for today.
S06E11,KRAMER,All right all right. Come on I'll take you over to Newman's
S06E11,GEORGE,"Hey, Cosmo what happened to your mother last night. She hung me out to dry."
S06E11,KRAMER,She quit.
S06E11,GEORGE,It would have been nice if someone told me about it. I just think you could have said something. That's all.
S06E11,KRAMER,"Don't talk to me George, talk to her."
S06E11,GEORGE,Well where is she?
S06E11,KRAMER,I don't know.
S06E11,KRAMER,Ma!
S06E11,BABS,Cosmo!
S06E11,NEWMAN,"We din, we didn't ... ... Cosmo?"
S06E12,JERRY,You sure you don't want the tickets?
S06E12,GEORGE,No thanks.
S06E12,JERRY,I can't believe I'm having trouble getting rid of Super Bowl tickets.
S06E12,GEORGE,"I'm telling you, skip the Drake's wedding, go to the game."
S06E12,JERRY,"I can't, the Drake put me in the wedding party."
S06E12,GEORGE,Well who schedules his wedding on Super Bowl Sunday?
S06E12,JERRY,Maybe he didn't know?
S06E12,GEORGE,Lemme see. I can't believe you got these for free. (Looking at the tickets) Row F?!
S06E12,JERRY,"Row F, in front of the Gs, hobnobbing with the Ds and Es."
S06E12,GEORGE,"Howbout Kramer or Elaine, they don't want them?"
S06E12,JERRY,"I asked. Elaine laughed at me, Kramer's only interested in Canadian football."
S06E12,GEORGE,Wish I could help you.
S06E12,JERRY,"Come on, take them. You could take Bonnie."
S06E12,GEORGE,You paying my hotel and airfare to Miami?
S06E12,JERRY,What do you think?
S06E12,GEORGE,"So in order to use these, I gotta spend like fifteen-hundred bucks. This is a bill for fifteen-hundred dollars. Plus, she'd ask about the sleeping arrangements, that whole sleeping arrangement conversation is depressing."
S06E12,JERRY,"Yeah, sleeping arrangements. So, you haven't, uh..."
S06E12,GEORGE,"Oh, no no no, I haven't even seen her apartment yet. Tomorrow night's the first night."
S06E12,JERRY,Aah.
S06E12,GEORGE,"Hey, is that Tim Whatley?"
S06E12,JERRY,The Dentist?
S06E12,GEORGE,"Yeah, is he still mad at you for crashing his Thanksgiving party?"
S06E12,JERRY,"Oh, no. I explained the whole thing to him, he was fine with it."
S06E12,GEORGE,Oh good.
S06E12,JERRY,"Yeah, I blamed it on you. Hi Tim."
S06E12,TIM,Hey Jerry! George. What are you up to?
S06E12,JERRY,"Ah, just a couple of gals out on the town, shopping and gabbing."
S06E12,GEORGE,I'm getting a makeover.
S06E12,JERRY,Hey. How would you like to go to the Super Bowl?
S06E12,TIM,"What, are you kidding?"
S06E12,JERRY,Here. Two tickets. Have a good time.
S06E12,TIM,"How can I think you? I'll tell you what, I'll take you to dinner sometime. You ever been to Mendys?"
S06E12,JERRY,No no no. No dinner.
S06E12,JERRY,"Tim, you didn't have to get me a thank you gift. I know, it's a label maker. The Label Baby Junior. Yeah, I hear they're good. Well, label me thankful. Okay, well you enjoy those tickets. Buh-bye."
S06E12,JERRY,Come in.
S06E12,KRAMER,Where can I put this?
S06E12,JERRY,What is it?
S06E12,KRAMER,"It's Risk, Jerry. The game of world conquest. (brushing newspapers off the table with his foot and setting the game board down) Alright, that's perfect."
S06E12,JERRY,"Kramer, why do you have to (noticing Newman) Hello, Newman."
S06E12,NEWMAN,"Hello, Jerry. Will he take it? I gotta go to work."
S06E12,JERRY,Take what?
S06E12,KRAMER,"The board, Jerry. We've been playing at Newman's for six hours but he's gotta go."
S06E12,JERRY,So why don't you leave it at Newman's?
S06E12,NEWMAN,"I wanted to, he won't let me."
S06E12,KRAMER,We have to put the board in a neutral place where no one will tamper with it.
S06E12,JERRY,So that's here?
S06E12,KRAMER,"Yes, yes. You're like Switzerland."
S06E12,JERRY,I don't wanna be Switzerland.
S06E12,KRAMER,"Jerry, Newman and I are engaged in a epic struggle for world domination. It's winner take all. People cannot be trusted."
S06E12,NEWMAN,Don't look at me.
S06E12,KRAMER,"Oh, I'm looking right at you, big daddy."
S06E12,JERRY,"Alright, soldier boys, let's fall out."
S06E12,KRAMER,"Alright, so you're gonna look after it?"
S06E12,JERRY,"Yeah, yeah."
S06E12,KRAMER,Stay strong buddy.
S06E12,JERRY,Yeah.
S06E12,KRAMER,Watch it good.
S06E12,JERRY,Ok.
S06E12,ELAINE,Hey.
S06E12,JERRY,Hey.
S06E12,ELAINE,"Hey. Oh, is that a label maker?"
S06E12,JERRY,"Yes it is. I got it as a gift, it's a Label Baby Junior."
S06E12,ELAINE,"Love the Label Baby, baby. You know those things make great gifts, I just got one of those for Tim Whatley for Christmas."
S06E12,JERRY,Tim Whatley?
S06E12,ELAINE,Yeah. Who sent you that one?
S06E12,JERRY,One Tim Whatley!
S06E12,ELAINE,"Not, my Tim Whatley?"
S06E12,JERRY,"The same, he sent it as a thank you for my Super Bowl tickets."
S06E12,ELAINE,I think this is the same one I gave him. He recycled this gift. He's a regifter!
S06E12,JERRY,"Or maybe he liked your gift so much, he decided to get me the same thing. Perhaps it's an homage."
S06E12,ELAINE,"Yeah, perhaps."
S06E12,JERRY,Well how did he react when you gave it to him?
S06E12,ELAINE,"Um, he said, ""Oh. A label maker. Howbout that?"""
S06E12,JERRY,He repeated the name of the gift?
S06E12,ELAINE,"Yeah, so?"
S06E12,JERRY,"Oh, well, if you repeat the name of the gift, you can't possibly like it."
S06E12,ELAINE,What do you mean?
S06E12,JERRY,"Oh, you know, like when someone opens something up and they go, ""Oh. Tube socks."" What are you gonna do about it?"
S06E12,ELAINE,"I don't know, I guess I'll just get invited up to his apartment and see if he's got a label maker."
S06E12,JERRY,Why'd you get him a gift anyway?
S06E12,ELAINE,"Oh, he did some dental work for me and he didn't charge me so I thought I'd get him a Christmas present."
S06E12,JERRY,"Yeah, well, if you're getting him anything for his birthday, I'm alarge."
S06E12,BONNIE,"Well, here we are. This is the place."
S06E12,GEORGE,Wow.
S06E12,BONNIE,Do you like it?
S06E12,GEORGE,"I love it! This is fantastic! Look at this couch, is this velvet?!"
S06E12,BONNIE,Are you a velvet fan?
S06E12,GEORGE,"A fan? I would drape myself in velvet if it were socially acceptable. And look at this, hardwood floors!"
S06E12,BONNIE,"Aren't they great? (sees a man enter from the bedroom) Oh, Scott, hi. This is George. George, this is Scott, my roommate."
S06E12,GEORGE,(bewildered) Heh heh.
S06E12,BONNIE,"Here, check out this view. If you lean out this window, you can see the river."
S06E12,GEORGE,"So Scott's your roommate, huh?"
S06E12,BONNIE,"Yes. Oh, I'm sure I've mentioned him."
S06E12,GEORGE,"No, you didn't mention it."
S06E12,BONNIE,"He's a great guy, you'll really like him."
S06E12,GEORGE,I'm sure I will.
S06E12,JERRY,"Male roommate, huh?"
S06E12,GEORGE,Yes. A male roommate.
S06E12,JERRY,Is this a problem?
S06E12,GEORGE,"It's a huge problem, Jerry. The hardest part about having sex with a woman is getting her to come back to your place! He's already got that."
S06E12,JERRY,"Well, maybe he's --"
S06E12,GEORGE,"No. Believe me, he's not."
S06E12,JERRY,So he's an eligible receiver.
S06E12,GEORGE,"She's confiding in him about our dates. You always like the person you talk to about the date more than the date! It's just a matter of time till they realize, 'Hey, we could have sex.'"
S06E12,JERRY,What's stopping them?
S06E12,GEORGE,Exactly! You know how they get animals to reproduce in captivity? They just put them in the same cage.
S06E12,JERRY,What does he look like?
S06E12,GEORGE,"Oh, that's the worst part of it. He looks just like me."
S06E12,JERRY,He looks like you and he's working from the inside?
S06E12,GEORGE,I look like me and I'm working from the outside. Who do you think is in the better position?
S06E12,JERRY,Not you.
S06E12,GEORGE,Ho ho. This bizarre ?harrod? experiment must end!
S06E12,JERRY,We'll take a check please.
S06E12,GEORGE,"I gotta find a way to work this out, I love that apartment. It's so cozy, I'm ensconced in velvet. You know, if it were socially acceptable--"
S06E12,JERRY,"I know, you would drape yourself in velvet."
S06E12,GEORGE,I've said that before?
S06E12,JERRY,"Many times. You love velvet, you want to live in velvet, everything with the velvet."
S06E12,KRAMER,(entering) Hey.
S06E12,GEORGE,Hey.
S06E12,JERRY,Hey.
S06E12,KRAMER,Guess what? I saw Newman talking to the super.
S06E12,JERRY,So what?
S06E12,KRAMER,The super has keys to your apartment. Don't you see what's going on? Newman is planning a sneak attack.
S06E12,JERRY,"Oh, maybe he's got no hot water."
S06E12,KRAMER,"Yeah, alright, fine. You sit there and you watch while Newman takes over the world. But he'd be a horrible leader. And you know who's gonna suffer? The little people; you and George."
S06E12,JERRY,Are you through?
S06E12,KRAMER,"Oh. I talked to Arthur Jobanian. Yeah, the Drake's wedding? That's off."
S06E12,JERRY,The wedding is off? What happened?
S06E12,KRAMER,"The Drake, he found out that the wedding is on the same day as the Super Bowl. So he wanted to postpone it, they got in a big argument and *phlf* it's over."
S06E12,GEORGE,The wedding is off. Now you can go to the Super Bowl.
S06E12,JERRY,I can't call Tim Whatley and ask for the tickets back.
S06E12,GEORGE,"You just gave them to him two days ago, he's gotta give you a grace period."
S06E12,JERRY,Are you even vaguely familiar with the concept of giving? There's no grace period.
S06E12,GEORGE,"Well, didn't he regift the label maker?"
S06E12,JERRY,Possibly.
S06E12,GEORGE,"Well, if he can regift, why can't you degift?"
S06E12,JERRY,You may have a point.
S06E12,GEORGE,"I have a point, I have a point."
S06E12,JERRY,"Alright, I'll call him."
S06E12,GEORGE,Yeah. What's that?
S06E12,JERRY,"Oh, it's Risk, it's a game of world domination being played by two guys who can barely run their own lives. (Picks up phone and dials) Hello Tim? Yeah, hi, it's Jerry Seinfeld, remember those tickets I gave you? Well it turns out I can use them. Oh, you do? I understand. Okay. Bye. He already made plans, he can't change them."
S06E12,GEORGE,"(eating a pickle) Well they're his tickets, he can do what he wants with them."
S06E12,JERRY,Thanks.
S06E12,GEORGE,"Alright, I gotta go. I'm heading over to Bonnie's."
S06E12,JERRY,What are you gonna do about the roommate?
S06E12,GEORGE,I gotta try and find a way to switch places with him. It's like a Sigfried and Roy trick.
S06E12,JERRY,"Well, the pickle breath is a good start."
S06E12,NEWMAN,"Hello Jerry, may I come in?"
S06E12,JERRY,What do you want?
S06E12,NEWMAN,"(squeezing himself through the narrow space) Nothing, just being neighborly. Do you wanna hang out? Shoot the breeze?"
S06E12,JERRY,"I'm not letting you cheat, Newman. You're not getting anywhere near that board."
S06E12,NEWMAN,Jerry? I'm a little insulted.
S06E12,JERRY,"You're not a little anything, Newman. So just pack it up and move it out of here."
S06E12,NEWMAN,"(leaving) Oh, by the way, what are you doing for the Super Bowl?"
S06E12,JERRY,"I dunno, watch it on TV I guess. Why?"
S06E12,NEWMAN,"Well if you watch closely enough, you just might see me. I'll be the one waving to the camera from my seat on the forty yard line."
S06E12,JERRY,You're going to the Super Bowl?
S06E12,NEWMAN,"Yes I am, a guy on my mail route just got a couple of tickets and he offered one to me."
S06E12,JERRY,What's his name?
S06E12,NEWMAN,Tim Whatley.
S06E12,JERRY,That's my ticket!
S06E12,NEWMAN,"Is it?! Ohhh, well if only you'd known, you could have saved some time and given it directly to me! Ha ha ha."
S06E12,JERRY,(as Newman leaves) Newman!
S06E12,GEORGE,What a movie. Good choice.
S06E12,BONNIE,Thank Scott. He recommended it.
S06E12,GEORGE,"Oh, Scott, Scott. He's really great, isn't he?"
S06E12,BONNIE,Yes he is.
S06E12,GEORGE,"Yes he is. Let me ask you something. When you come out of the shower and you put your robe on, do you cinch it real tight, are you concerned about that?"
S06E12,BONNIE,George?
S06E12,GEORGE,"Do you hold the neck together with one hand, or are you just letting it flap in the breeze?"
S06E12,BONNIE,"George, you're being ridiculous."
S06E12,GEORGE,What's the massage situation?
S06E12,BONNIE,What do you mean?
S06E12,GEORGE,"Is there any work being done? Is there any rubbing, touching, finger manipulation on the other person, and if so, who's making the request?"
S06E12,BONNIE,"George, would you just stop?"
S06E12,GEORGE,"Say you go to the bathroom at two o'clock in the morning, what's the outfit? I mean, you dressing up or is it come as you are?"
S06E12,BONNIE,"George, what is wrong with you?"
S06E12,GEORGE,"I'll tell you what's wrong, a grown woman with a male roommate! It's unnatural, it's an abomination!"
S06E12,SCOTT,Hey!
S06E12,GEORGE,Hey!
S06E12,SCOTT,How ya going?
S06E12,GEORGE,I'm good.
S06E12,SCOTT,(to Bonnie) Are you gonna need the bathroom? 'Cause I'm gonna jump in the shower.
S06E12,BONNIE,"No, just throw my bras out of the way."
S06E12,TIM,"Well, this is my building."
S06E12,ELAINE,Yes it is.
S06E12,TIM,"This was fun, you know?"
S06E12,ELAINE,Yeah.
S06E12,TIM,"So, I'll call."
S06E12,ELAINE,Aren't you gonna invite me upstairs?
S06E12,TIM,Upstairs? You wanna go upstairs?
S06E12,ELAINE,I would love to go upstairs.
S06E12,TIM,"Elaine, you are something else. No one can ever put a label on you, huh?"
S06E12,ELAINE,We'll see.
S06E12,JERRY,Newman. He's going with Newman.
S06E12,GEORGE,How does Tim Whatley even know Newman?
S06E12,JERRY,Newman's his mailman.
S06E12,GEORGE,Who goes to the Super Bowl with their mailman?!
S06E12,JERRY,Who goes *anywhere* with Newman?!
S06E12,GEORGE,"Well, he's merry."
S06E12,JERRY,"He is merry, I'll give him that. (notices a cactus on the table) What's this plant for?"
S06E12,GEORGE,I had a little tiff with Bonnie about the roommate.
S06E12,JERRY,"Oh, well the cactus will smooth things over."
S06E12,ELAINE,"Hey, guess what? I'm going to the Super Bowl with Tim Whatley."
S06E12,JERRY,What?
S06E12,ELAINE,We went out for coffee last night and he offered me a ticket.
S06E12,JERRY,What about the label maker?
S06E12,ELAINE,"Ah, well."
S06E12,JERRY,"Wait a minute, that's my ticket! You didn't even want to go."
S06E12,ELAINE,"It was totally out of the blue. We went upstairs to his apartment, you know, to look for the label maker."
S06E12,JERRY,"So, how did you get up there? Did you say you had to use the bathroom?"
S06E12,ELAINE,No.
S06E12,JERRY,Then how'd you get up there?
S06E12,ELAINE,"I said, ""Do you wanna go upstairs?"""
S06E12,GEORGE,And there's you ticket.
S06E12,ELAINE,What?
S06E12,JERRY,That's why you're going to the Super Bowl.
S06E12,ELAINE,Why?
S06E12,JERRY,"You go out with a guy one time, you ask him to go upstairs like you're Mae West? Of course he's gonna try and get you alone for the weekend."
S06E12,ELAINE,"You mean just because I asked him to go upstairs, he thinks he's going downtown?"
S06E12,JERRY,Obviously.
S06E12,ELAINE,You're crazy.
S06E12,GEORGE,"Well, what happened when you got upstairs?"
S06E12,ELAINE,"As soon as we walked in, he got a call from one of his patients with an impacted molar or something so he had to leave. I didn't even get a chance to look for the label maker."
S06E12,JERRY,"Yeah, well I don't trust this guy. I think he regifted, he degifted, and now he's using an upstairs invite as a springboard to a Super Bowl sex romp."
S06E12,KRAMER,Hey.
S06E12,JERRY,Hey. What are you doing?
S06E12,KRAMER,I'm watching your door.
S06E12,JERRY,My door?
S06E12,KRAMER,"Yeah, from my peephole. Fisheye, sees all."
S06E12,JERRY,(still outside) What was that?
S06E12,KRAMER,Newman!
S06E12,NEWMAN,(fleeing to the bedroom) Damn!
S06E12,JERRY,(after entering) The bedroom!
S06E12,JERRY,"I see you, Newman! I see you!"
S06E12,KRAMER,I'm taking the Congo as a penalty!
S06E12,ELAINE,I've got a confession to make.
S06E12,TIM,Oh? What's that?
S06E12,ELAINE,I've got Super Bowl fever.
S06E12,TIM,"Oh yeah, me too."
S06E12,ELAINE,So where are we staying?
S06E12,TIM,"Oh, the Ambassador."
S06E12,ELAINE,Oh. Big room?
S06E12,TIM,"It's a regular room, but it's right downtown."
S06E12,ELAINE,Downtown?
S06E12,TIM,Right downtown.
S06E12,ELAINE,"What do they have there, a couple of beds?"
S06E12,TIM,Why? You bringing someone else?
S06E12,ELAINE,"No, but don't you think there should be two beds? There's two of us."
S06E12,BONNIE,"Oh, a cactus."
S06E12,GEORGE,"They don't need any water, so you don't have to keep taking them to the bathroom."
S06E12,SCOTT,"Well, look who's here."
S06E12,BONNIE,I asked Scott to move out.
S06E12,GEORGE,Oh. Oh!
S06E12,JERRY,So she kicked him out of the apartment.
S06E12,GEORGE,That's right. It's just me and her.
S06E12,JERRY,"Wow, she rearranged her whole life for you."
S06E12,GEORGE,"I guess she did. He's gone, now I'm the man."
S06E12,JERRY,That's not a good role for you.
S06E12,GEORGE,"No, it's not."
S06E12,JERRY,You unwittingly made a major commitment. That's a lot of pressure.
S06E12,GEORGE,Oh my god.
S06E12,JERRY,"You wanted to be ensconced in velvet, you're buried."
S06E12,GEORGE,"I had the perfect situation here, he was shouldering half the load."
S06E12,JERRY,He was shouldering.
S06E12,GEORGE,(walking towards the door) I couldn't leave well enough alone?!
S06E12,JERRY,Where are you going?
S06E12,GEORGE,I gotta go help her tape up all his boxes and get them ready for shipping.
S06E12,JERRY,"Oh, well here. Take Whatley's label maker, I don't want to see it again."
S06E12,GEORGE,Thanks.
S06E12,KRAMER,(rolling the dice) Yeah. I am taking over South America and there ain't nothing you can do about it.
S06E12,JERRY,"So, too bad about that Super Bowl ticket, eh Newman?"
S06E12,NEWMAN,"Yeah. I just hope Tim Whatley's electric bills don't suddenly get lost in the mail, or it could be lights out for him."
S06E12,JERRY,"(walking out) Thanks for having me over, guys."
S06E12,JERRY,"Alright, I'll see you later."
S06E12,TIM,Hey Jerry?
S06E12,JERRY,"Ah, Tim Whatley. Out scalping?"
S06E12,TIM,"Ah, see, now I've been thinking a lot about what happened and I feel horrible. Listen, I want to give you a ticket back."
S06E12,JERRY,"Are you serious, what about Elaine?"
S06E12,TIM,"Oh, Elaine. Yeah, well, things just didn't work out like I thought they would."
S06E12,JERRY,"Oh. (notices a car being jacked up by a tow truck) Hey, isn't this Kramer's car? (yelling up) Hey, Cosmo!! They're towing your car!!"
S06E12,KRAMER,(running to the window) What?! Not my car!! Hey!! They're towing my car!!
S06E12,NEWMAN,What are you doing?
S06E12,KRAMER,I'm taking the board with me.
S06E12,TIM,"So, I guess I'll see you at the game."
S06E12,JERRY,"Yeah, see you there."
S06E12,BONNIE,"Hi, George."
S06E12,GEORGE,"What, what happened? Where's, where's all the stuff?"
S06E12,BONNIE,It's gone. It was all his. Is this a label maker?
S06E12,GEORGE,"The table, the stereo, the VCR, the velvet couch, where's the velvet?"
S06E12,BONNIE,"They were his. Besides, we don't need any of those things. We have each other."
S06E12,NEWMAN,Are you sure you know where the impound yard is?
S06E12,KRAMER,"Oh, stop stalling. Come on."
S06E12,NEWMAN,"I can't think, there's all this noise."
S06E12,KRAMER,Or is it because I've built a stronghold around Greenland? I've driven you out of Western Europe and I've left you teetering on the brink of complete annihilation.
S06E12,NEWMAN,I'm not beaten yet. I still have armies in the Ukraine.
S06E12,KRAMER,"Ha ha, the Ukraine. Do you know what the Ukraine is? It's a sitting duck. A road apple, Newman. The Ukraine is weak. It's feeble. I think it's time to put the hurt on the Ukraine."
S06E12,UKRAINIAN,I come from Ukraine. You not say Ukraine weak.
S06E12,KRAMER,"Yeah, well we're playing a game here, pal."
S06E12,UKRAINIAN,Ukraine is game to you?! Howbout I take your little board and smash it!!
S06E12,ELAINE,"Hello, Tim."
S06E12,TIM,"(startled) Elaine, hi."
S06E12,ELAINE,"Don't worry, Tim. I didn't come by to yell at you, I didn't come by for that at all. I just came by to pick up my label maker. I gave you a label maker and now I would like to have it back."
S06E12,TIM,But you gave it to me.
S06E12,ELAINE,"But you gave me a ticket to the Super Bowl. Hand it over, Whatley."
S06E12,TIM,"Uh, ok."
S06E12,ELAINE,"You don't have the label maker, do you?"
S06E12,TIM,"Uh, no."
S06E12,ELAINE,I knew it! You're a regifter!
S06E12,TIM,"Oh, yeah, some gift. That thing didn't work at all."
S06E12,ELAINE,What?
S06E12,TIM,"You put a label on something, then ten minutes later it would peel right off. It was the worst gift I ever got."
S06E12,ELAINE,"(visibly upset) Well, I bought it for you because you were so nice to me for not charging me for the dental work. The way you worked on my filling, you were so, so gentle and so caring and so sensitive."
S06E12,TIM,"Oh, Elaine!"
S06E12,JERRY,"H... G... F. Seat four. One, two, three... f-- Hello Newman."
S06E12,NEWMAN,"Hello, Jerry. Tim couldn't make it, he's in love. Isn't that wonderful?"
S06E12,JERRY,"Oh, it's enchanting."
S06E12,BONNIE,Hi.
S06E12,GEORGE,"Here's the TV. I know you wanted to watch the Super Bowl. Do you at least have some towels we could sit on? It's, like, a four hour game."
S06E12,BONNIE,"George, Scott's gonna drop by. He said he never got his boxes. I'll get the towels."
S06E12,GEORGE,"(internally) How am I gonna get out of this? Think Costanza, think!"
S06E12,BONNIE,Here we are.
S06E12,GEORGE,"Hey, do you know, Bonnie, I just had a pretty wild idea."
S06E12,BONNIE,What is it?
S06E12,GEORGE,"Well I, uh, I'm not sure how you pronounce it or anything, but I, uh, I believe it's Mnage  Trois?"
S06E12,BONNIE,What?
S06E12,SCOTT,Hi.
S06E12,BONNIE,Scott! Remember what we talked about the other day? George is into it.
S06E12,SCOTT,Oh really?!
S06E12,NEWMAN,"Great streak of luck I'm having. First, Kramer almost beat me at Risk but I narrowly escaped, and then Tim Whatley gives me his Super Bowl ticket."
S06E12,JERRY,Can you move over at all?!
S06E12,NEWMAN,"And then, just as I'm about to go, these boxes show up at the post office with no labels. No labels, Jerry. You know what that means? Freebies!! I got this great mini-TV and a VCR, oh it's unbelievable."
S06E12,JERRY,An inch! Can you move over an inch?!?
S06E13,GARY,Hey George.
S06E13,GEORGE,"Gary? Well, well, well well. Where the hell've you been? I've been leaving you phone messages for months."
S06E13,GARY,I know. I've been pretty busy.
S06E13,GEORGE,"Busy. Don't give me busy. Who's not busy? I'm busy, we're all busy, everybody's busy. All right, tell me, what's kept you so busy?"
S06E13,GARY,"Mostly chemotherapy. 'Kay, I'll see you."
S06E13,KRAMER,(to car as it accelerates away) Hey pig!
S06E13,COP,(at car) Hey! Hey! Hey!
S06E13,JERRY,So you called the cop a pig?
S06E13,KRAMER,I was yelling at the litterbug. I mean this is my town. You don't throw trash on the streets of my town.
S06E13,JERRY,Didn't you explain that to the cop?
S06E13,KRAMER,"No, I fled the scene."
S06E13,JERRY,(to George) Hey.
S06E13,KRAMER,(to George) Hey buddy.
S06E13,GEORGE,"Hey, uh..."
S06E13,KRAMER,What?
S06E13,GEORGE,"Kramer, I, I, I, uh, I need to talk to Jerry privately."
S06E13,KRAMER,Oh. What about?
S06E13,GEORGE,Kramer...
S06E13,KRAMER,"Aw come on George, you can share it with me, huh?"
S06E13,GEORGE,"Hey, you're hurting me!"
S06E13,KRAMER,"You gonna share it with me next time, huh?"
S06E13,GEORGE,"I swear, I swear!"
S06E13,KRAMER,"Aw, all right, I'm looking forward to it."
S06E13,GEORGE,"Right, I got news. You ready? (deep breath) Gary Fogel had cancer."
S06E13,JERRY,"Oh yeah, I knew."
S06E13,GEORGE,You knew? How did you know?
S06E13,JERRY,He told me a few months ago.
S06E13,GEORGE,Why did he tell you and not me?
S06E13,JERRY,I don't know.
S06E13,GEORGE,How are you closer to him than me?
S06E13,GEORGE,"So, is he okay?"
S06E13,JERRY,"Oh yeah, he's fine, fine. He was in bad shape for a while though."
S06E13,GEORGE,"Huh, really? How bad? Was he on his death bed?"
S06E13,JERRY,"No, he was on his regular bed."
S06E13,GEORGE,So why didn't you tell me?
S06E13,JERRY,He swore me to secrecy.
S06E13,GEORGE,So?
S06E13,JERRY,It's not like you're my wife.
S06E13,GEORGE,"Well, I still think you shoulda told me."
S06E13,JERRY,"Hey, believe me, you were better off not knowing. It's not easy to deal with someone in a situation like this. I was so nice to him I almost made myself sick."
S06E13,GEORGE,"Well, I wanna talk to him about this."
S06E13,JERRY,"That's right, you let him have it."
S06E13,GEORGE,Mmm-mm.
S06E13,JERRY,Who is he not to tell you about his life-threatening illness?
S06E13,GEORGE,That's what I'm saying.
S06E13,JERRY,His illness is your business.
S06E13,GEORGE,"If not mine, whose?"
S06E13,JERRY,"If not now, when?"
S06E13,ELAINE,Were you just talking about me?
S06E13,GEORGE,"No, an old friend of ours, Gary."
S06E13,ELAINE,"Oh, the guy with cancer?"
S06E13,GEORGE,"(to Jerry, yelling) You told her? She's not your wife!"
S06E13,JERRY,"If I told you, you woulda given it away."
S06E13,GEORGE,You don't think I can keep a secret?
S06E13,JERRY,"No, but he would've read your face."
S06E13,GEORGE,You don't trust my poker face?
S06E13,JERRY,Do you ever win at poker?
S06E13,GEORGE,(shamefaced) No.
S06E13,KRAMER,"Hey. (to Elaine) Oh, I just saw your old boyfriend on TV."
S06E13,ELAINE,"Egh, Jake Jarmel?"
S06E13,KRAMER,Yeah. I really liked those glasses he was wearing. Where'd he get those.
S06E13,ELAINE,Why? You don't wear glasses.
S06E13,KRAMER,"I know, I know. But I need a new look, I'm stagnating."
S06E13,GEORGE,"I have to say, as a glasses wearer I take exception to that. That's like me buying a wheelchair to cruise around in."
S06E13,KRAMER,"Yeah, I've considered that. (to Elaine) Look, how do I get in touch with this guy?"
S06E13,ELAINE,"Well, he's having a two day book signing at Waldens."
S06E13,KRAMER,Ah.
S06E13,ELAINE,"You know, we had a really bad break-up."
S06E13,JERRY,The Jujy Fruits?
S06E13,ELAINE,"(upset) Yeah, the Jujy Fruits."
S06E13,JAKE,"Okay, K-Man, enjoy the book."
S06E13,KRAMER,"Okay, thank you. Listen Jake, uh, where did you get those eyeglass frames?"
S06E13,JAKE,I can't tell you that.
S06E13,KRAMER,So you don't know where you got 'em?
S06E13,JAKE,Yes I do. But I don't want anyone else to have them.
S06E13,KRAMER,"Well, that's peculiar. (leaves)"
S06E13,GEORGE,"Eh, there's that woman that never talks to anybody."
S06E13,GARY,Really?
S06E13,GEORGE,"Every day she comes in, she sits at that table and reads. Never talks to anybody."
S06E13,GARY,"Oh, I talked to Debby Bibelo. She said to say hi."
S06E13,GEORGE,"(pleasant surprise) Really? (admonishing) You know Gary, I really have to say, I'm a little bit hurt that you didn't decide to confide in me."
S06E13,GARY,"Well frankly, you can't keep a secret. You know, you'd get two pair, the whole table knows."
S06E13,GEORGE,Well I still think it was wrong.
S06E13,GARY,"Right, well I'm sorry, all right. I guess I was just thinking of myself."
S06E13,GEORGE,"(well, obviously) Yes."
S06E13,KRAMER,"...so I called the litterbug a pig, not you. I like policeman. I wanted to be a policeman."
S06E13,COP,Yeah? So why didn't you?
S06E13,KRAMER,Scared of being shot.
S06E13,COP,"Mr Kramer, let me tell you a story. In nineteen-seventy-nine I ticketed a brown Dodge Diplomat for parking in a Church zone. That fine was never paid, and since then that scofflaw has piled up more parking tickets than anyone in New York City. For sixteen years I pursued him, only to see him give me the slip time and time again. I never got a clean look at his face, but he's become my 'white whale'. Mr Kramer, that day was yesterday! But thanks to you, I don't know if I'll ever get that chance again!"
S06E13,KRAMER,I like that eye patch.
S06E13,GEORGE,"(standing) All right, I'm gonna move my car, my meter's up. Can't park in this city."
S06E13,GARY,"(standing) Hey, George, listen. You know that company I work for, they own that parking lot around the corner."
S06E13,GEORGE,"Wha, that's a Kinney lot?"
S06E13,GARY,"Yeah, and there's a space opening up, and I could get it for you. You just have to pay the tax on it. It'd be like, fifty a month."
S06E13,GEORGE,"Fifty bucks a month, that's incredible! Okay, thanks."
S06E13,GARY,"All right, I got lunch, all right."
S06E13,GEORGE,You still owe me a secret.
S06E13,GARY,"All right, listen. There is something I haven't told you, all right?"
S06E13,GEORGE,Yeah?
S06E13,GARY,"Yeah, but uhm, you can't tell Jerry."
S06E13,GEORGE,What do think I tell Jerry everything? It's not like he's my wife.
S06E13,GARY,"Okay. Well, the thing is, I've been living a lie."
S06E13,GEORGE,Just one? I'm living like twenty. (chuckles) What's yours?
S06E13,GARY,"Well, I (laughs) I never actually had cancer. (laughs) I'll see you. (leaves)"
S06E13,ELAINE,So he refused to tell you where he got the glasses?
S06E13,KRAMER,"(rising) Flat out refused! (walks past Jerry, who moves his legs)"
S06E13,ELAINE,"Yeah, isn't that just like him? (she steps over Jerry's legs) You know, he has to be the only one who has 'em."
S06E13,KRAMER,"Yeah, tell me about it, soul sister. (he opens the door to leave) Anyway, I told Jake that you said hi."
S06E13,ELAINE,What? (she slams the door shut before Kramer can exit) You told Jake I said hi?
S06E13,KRAMER,Yeah.
S06E13,ELAINE,I can't believe you did that! Why did you tell him I said hi? I never said hi! (to Jerry) When did I say hi?
S06E13,JERRY,I never heard her say hi.
S06E13,KRAMER,"Well, it's uh, common courtesy."
S06E13,ELAINE,"No, no. (stamps foot) Kramer, you don't understand. He made the last contact between us. I had the upper hand in the post-breakup relationship. If he thinks that I said hi, then I lose the upper hand."
S06E13,JERRY,It's like a game of tag.
S06E13,JERRY,Where you going?
S06E13,ELAINE,Nowhere.
S06E13,JERRY,"You're going to the book store to see Jake Jarmel, aren't you?"
S06E13,ELAINE,So what if I do? (heads for the door)
S06E13,KRAMER,"(to the exiting Elaine) Yeah, well, listen. If you're going there, (following her out the door) maybe you can get him to tell you where he got those glasses. (shouting after her) Elaine!"
S06E13,JERRY,Hey. How'd it go with Gary?
S06E13,GEORGE,"(shifty, avoiding Jerry's eyes) Fine, fine. (he removes his coat)"
S06E13,JERRY,(suspicious) Really?
S06E13,GEORGE,(shifty) Yeah.
S06E13,JERRY,You look like something's on your mind.
S06E13,GEORGE,No. Nothing. Fine. (he sits at the table)
S06E13,JERRY,"So, that's your poker face."
S06E13,GEORGE,My regular face.
S06E13,JERRY,No it isn't. I've seen your regular face. That is not it.
S06E13,GEORGE,What are you saying?
S06E13,JERRY,"All right George, c'mon, what d'you got? (sits opposite George)"
S06E13,GEORGE,I got nothing.
S06E13,JERRY,"What you got, a pair of bullets?"
S06E13,GEORGE,What you talking about?
S06E13,JERRY,Two pair? Three of a kind?
S06E13,GEORGE,Will you stop it?
S06E13,JERRY,"Oh my God, you got a flush! You're holding a flush!"
S06E13,GEORGE,I don't have a flush.
S06E13,JERRY,"A full house? You got a full house? Turn 'em over George, I wanna see 'em. Come on, I'm calling! (thumps hand on table) What d'you got!"
S06E13,GEORGE,"(broken, shouts) Gary Fogel never had cancer!"
S06E13,ELAINE,"So you see, Kramer took it upon himself to say hi to you from me. When in fact it was an unauthorised hi."
S06E13,JAKE,You're saying you didn't say hi.
S06E13,ELAINE,That's what I'm saying.
S06E13,JAKE,So that's what you came down here to tell me?
S06E13,ELAINE,Correct.
S06E13,JAKE,You never said hi?
S06E13,ELAINE,Correct.
S06E13,JAKE,"You still like me, don't you?"
S06E13,ELAINE,Correct. (catches herself) What's that?
S06E13,MAN,"Hey, I have been trying to get this book signed all day."
S06E13,ELAINE,"(takes the book from the guy and signs it herself) How can you say that I still like you, when I didn't even say hi to you?"
S06E13,JAKE,"Elaine, coming down here to say that you didn't say hi is more of a gesture than if you did say hi."
S06E13,ELAINE,"Ah, Jake... (realises his logic) I, uh..."
S06E13,GEORGE,"The doctors thought he had cancer, but the surgery revealed he never actually had it."
S06E13,JERRY,So what was wrong with him?
S06E13,GEORGE,Nothing!
S06E13,JERRY,So he's been lying to me for two months?!
S06E13,GEORGE,That's right.
S06E13,JERRY,"What kind of person is this? There's only one other person who might be able to do something like this, and that's you."
S06E13,GEORGE,Well...
S06E13,JERRY,I don't even think you could do it.
S06E13,GEORGE,"Oh, I could do it."
S06E13,JERRY,"Yeah, I guess you could."
S06E13,GEORGE,(snorts) C'mon.
S06E13,JERRY,"Did you know he was so worried about losing more hair if he had to get chemo treatment, I bought him an unlimited gift certificate at the Hair Team For Men, just to put his mind at ease?"
S06E13,GEORGE,You did that?
S06E13,JERRY,"Yeah. Oh, I can't wait to talk to this guy. (moves to pick up phone)"
S06E13,GEORGE,"Wait a minute, wait a minute. You can't say anything. (rushes to take phone from Jerry)"
S06E13,JERRY,Why not?
S06E13,GEORGE,"(puts down handset) Because he'll know I told you. Besides, he's giving me a parking spot around the corner for practically nothing."
S06E13,JERRY,"So you're telling me, because you're getting free parking, I gotta pretend this guy had cancer when he didn't?"
S06E13,GEORGE,Yeah.
S06E13,JERRY,"Well I don't like it. I don't like it one bit! And, I'm supposed to see him tomorrow."
S06E13,GEORGE,"Yeah, well you have to maintain the same disposition too. You can't start acting any differently. You have to be nice."
S06E13,JERRY,Why didn't he tell me?
S06E13,GEORGE,Because you were being so nice.
S06E13,JERRY,I don't think I can be that nice.
S06E13,GEORGE,(shouts) You be nice!
S06E13,JERRY,Gary?
S06E13,GARY,"What d'you think? Check it out. (he tries a number of expressions, turning his head side to side, to show off the hairpiece)"
S06E13,JERRY,Is that from my gift certificate?
S06E13,GARY,Yeah buddy. You really came through for me man. You've been so nice. (shakes Jerry by the hand)
S06E13,JERRY,"(through gritted teeth) Yeah, well, I'm glad you could take advantage."
S06E13,GARY,"Hey, you know what I'm thinking of doing? I'm getting rid of all my fillings, 'cos that mercury's toxic. Hey, let me see your fillings."
S06E13,JERRY,I don't think so.
S06E13,GARY,"Oh come on, open up. Let me take a look."
S06E13,GEORGE (V.O.),You be nice! He's giving me a parking space (echoes) parking space... parking space...
S06E13,GARY,"(peering in) Well, what d'you know. Hey, lookee there, you're loaded."
S06E13,JERRY,Okay. (shuts mouth)
S06E13,GARY,"Hey, look who's over there. Miss Cool-toes. Check this out, Jack! (rises)"
S06E13,KRAMER,(to Jerry) Hey buddy.
S06E13,JERRY,Hey. Look at you. Wha... what's this?
S06E13,KRAMER,It's an eyepatch.
S06E13,JERRY,You look like a pirate.
S06E13,KRAMER,I wanna be a pirate.
S06E13,JERRY,(gesturing) This is Gary.
S06E13,KRAMER,(to Gary) How you doing?
S06E13,GARY,All right.
S06E13,KRAMER,"Well, I tell you there's only one problem."
S06E13,JERRY,Can't see on your right side?
S06E13,KRAMER,"No. It's uh, (swaps patch to the other eye) it's itchy"
S06E13,DEBBY,Nice car.
S06E13,GEORGE,Yeah. Once belonged to Jon Voight.
S06E13,DEBBY,"So, what made you just call me out of the blue like that?"
S06E13,GEORGE,"Oh, well, uh. Gary told me you said hi."
S06E13,DEBBY,I didn't say hi.
S06E13,GEORGE,You didn't?
S06E13,DEBBY,"Uh, no. I told him to send you my regards. I didn't say hi."
S06E13,GEORGE,Regards?
S06E13,DEBBY,"Yeah, regards."
S06E13,ELAINE,"Anyway, I admit I was dumb to go to the bookstore to tell him I didn't say hi, but he didn't have to act so smug. Oh, I hate smugness. Don't you hate smugness?"
S06E13,CABBIE,(heavy accent) Smugness is not a good quality.
S06E13,ELAINE,"(looking out of window) Oh my God. That man over there. I think he's wearing glasses that look just like Jake's. Pull over, stop the car. (hands money to cabbie as she exits) Here, here. I think I got a way of getting back at my ex-boyfriend."
S06E13,CABBIE,Good. Revenge is very good.
S06E13,ELAINE,"(calling down street) 'Scuse me! 'Scuse me. (catches up to guy) Excuse me, sir. Sir?"
S06E13,GUY,Yes?
S06E13,ELAINE,"Uh. Ah, if you don't mind my asking, could you tell me where you got your glasses?"
S06E13,GUY,Malaysia.
S06E13,ELAINE,Malaysia?
S06E13,GUY,Yeah.
S06E13,ELAINE,"Uhm, look, I know this'll sound odd, but can I buy them from you?"
S06E13,GUY,"Actually, I was gonna buy a new pair."
S06E13,ELAINE,(positive) Oh! (little chuckle)
S06E13,GUY,"But I, I can barely see without these."
S06E13,ELAINE,C'mon.
S06E13,GUY,"Well, these were expensive."
S06E13,ELAINE,Let's start the bidding.
S06E13,GEORGE,"So, you didn't think this was a date?"
S06E13,DEBBY,"N... no, not really. Why, is it... a date?"
S06E13,GEORGE,I thought it was a date.
S06E13,DEBBY,No. It's not a date.
S06E13,GEORGE,What about the regards?
S06E13,DEBBY,"Regards don't mean anything. I mean, it's not like I said hi. Hey, the fact is... (sighs) I shouldn't say anything."
S06E13,GEORGE,"No, tell me."
S06E13,DEBBY,Can you keep a secret?
S06E13,GEORGE,Me? Oh yeah.
S06E13,DEBBY,"(deep breath) I never had feelings for Gary until he got sick. But, h... he was so brave and... and gained such a wonderful perspective on life. I... I fell in love with him."
S06E13,GEORGE,"Oh, the guy's got some perspective there."
S06E13,JERRY,"Hey, do you know what the Whip does?"
S06E13,KRAMER,What whip?
S06E13,JERRY,"The Whip. In the Senate, in the House."
S06E13,KRAMER,"Well, you know in the old days, when the senators didn't vote the way that the party leaders wanted 'em to... they whipped them. (holds imaginary whip) You better vote the way we want you to, or there's gonna be big trouble. (cracks invisible whip and makes sound effect)"
S06E13,GARY,"She won't talk to anyone, huh? Oh no, she won't say a word to anybody. Well, she's talking a blue streak now, Jack!"
S06E13,COP,"Well, well. The 'white whale'."
S06E13,GEORGE,"(frustrated) Oh, look at this. There's no place to park around here. I don't even know why they sell cars in Manhattan."
S06E13,DEBBY,"Don't complain, at least you have your health."
S06E13,DEBBY,"George, look out for that man!"
S06E13,COP,"(to escaping car) Hey! Hey, get back here!"
S06E13,KRAMER,(looking after fleeing car) Newman! The white whale!
S06E13,GEORGE,Can you believe he sold his glasses on the street?
S06E13,JERRY,Can you believe someone would lie about chemotherapy to get a wig? Would you do that?
S06E13,GEORGE,No. Definitely not.
S06E13,JERRY,Yeah.
S06E13,GEORGE,I'm pretty sure I wouldn't.
S06E13,JERRY,And you know what else? He picked up that woman in the coffee shop.
S06E13,GEORGE,The one who always sits by herself?
S06E13,JERRY,Yeah!
S06E13,GEORGE,How did he do that?
S06E13,JERRY,Because he was brimming with confidence from the toupee.
S06E13,GEORGE,Really? And Debby told me that she fell in love with him because he has all this perspective!
S06E13,JERRY,"She thinks a guy who lies about a life-threatening illness, so he can get some phony hair has perspective?"
S06E13,GEORGE,(opening door to leave) He picked her up?
S06E13,JERRY,Walked right over to her table.
S06E13,GEORGE,"Wow. (he runs his fingers through his hair, and then brushes the resulting fallout off his jacket)"
S06E13,ELAINE,"Jake, Jake. Take a look. (puts on the frames she bought) Aaw, see, you're not the only one who has 'em. I have them too."
S06E13,JAKE,Where did you get those?
S06E13,ELAINE,Malaysia. I was in the area.
S06E13,NEWMAN,(surprised) Kramer.
S06E13,KRAMER,Just drive.
S06E13,KRAMER,"All right. Now you listen, and you listen good. I know who you are. You're the scofflaw."
S06E13,NEWMAN,(defensive) What're you talking about...
S06E13,KRAMER,"(interrupting) Ah, don't play dumb. It's me, Cosmo."
S06E13,NEWMAN,"All right, so it's me. So what?"
S06E13,KRAMER,"You don't think I know how you're feeling, every second of the day? Looking over your shoulder to see if someone's coming up from behind. Sitting alone at night, knowing they could be closing in."
S06E13,NEWMAN,"I can't sleep, I tell you! I can't sleep!"
S06E13,KRAMER,"Ga, of course you can't, you poor sap! Now why didn't you tell me?"
S06E13,NEWMAN,I couldn't. I couldn't tell anyone.
S06E13,KRAMER,So you been living this secret the whole time by yourself?
S06E13,NEWMAN,"(sobbing) Yes, it's been awful. I wanted to tell somebody. (pleading) Help me Kramer! Help me!"
S06E13,KRAMER,"All right, all right, I'm gonna help you."
S06E13,GEORGE,I'll try some on and see how they look. It's just hair.
S06E13,JERRY,"You ever see what that thing looks like in the back? You got your natural little curls on the bottom, and then that big phony mat coming down on top of 'em."
S06E13,GEORGE,"Well, some of 'em look good. The ones that look good you don't even know about."
S06E13,JERRY,What if you get involved with a woman? How're you gonna tell her?
S06E13,GEORGE,"The way they make 'em these days, I'll never have to tell her."
S06E13,JERRY,"So you keep it a secret your whole life, then at your funeral the mortician comes out (as mortician) 'Here, Mrs Costanza, I thought you might want this'. (as Mrs Costanza, horrified) Aahh!"
S06E13,LIPPMAN,"It's no secret that it's my dream to have my own publishing house, and if this Jake Jarmel book does, you know, what I think it's gonna do. If I can get this whole thing off the ground, then , you know, I think I'll have something for you. (laughs)"
S06E13,ELAINE,"Oh, Mr Lippman. (joins laughter) That is so exciting. I mean, you have no idea how sick I am of running around town looking for socks."
S06E13,LIPPMAN,"Yeah, by the way, those are great glasses."
S06E13,ELAINE,"Oh really, you like 'em?"
S06E13,LIPPMAN,Uh huh. Very unusual.
S06E13,ELAINE,"Well, you know what? (removes glasses)"
S06E13,LIPPMAN,What?
S06E13,ELAINE,(hands them over) You can have 'em.
S06E13,LIPPMAN,"Oh, no no no. (waves them away) Please."
S06E13,ELAINE,"No no no no. Go to that place on the corner, they'll change the prescription in an hour. Take 'em."
S06E13,LIPPMAN,Really?
S06E13,ELAINE,"Yeah, I've no use for them anymore. Honestly."
S06E13,LIPPMAN,(accepting) I could use a new pair of reading glasses.
S06E13,ELAINE,They're from Malaysia.
S06E13,LIPPMAN,(putting on spectacles) Oh yeah?
S06E13,ELAINE,(admiring gasp) Fabulous.
S06E13,JUDGE,"Well Mr Newman, in all my years on the bench, I have never come across anything quite like this. I have given this matter some very serious consideration and I've decided that what's best for the city and possibly for yourself, is for you to keep your car, in a garage..."
S06E13,JUDGE,...convenient to your home.
S06E13,NEWMAN,(sobbing) I can't afford that!
S06E13,JUDGE,"Afford it you will, Mr Newman. Or this court will see that your car is impounded..."
S06E13,JUDGE,...and sold at auction.
S06E13,KRAMER,"Well, don't you worry, your honour. He's in my custody."
S06E13,GEORGE,"(to Jerry) Well, what d'you think?"
S06E13,JERRY,"(unimpressed) I, really can't say."
S06E13,GEORGE,"No, say. I want you to say."
S06E13,JERRY,"It's not good, okay. It's not good. You look (searches for word) stupid. (to salesman) I'm sorry."
S06E13,SALESMAN,You have to realise this has not been custom-fitted to his scalp.
S06E13,GEORGE,(examining reflection) I really think this looks pretty good.
S06E13,JERRY,"Why don't you get a pair of white shoes, move down to Miami Beach and get the whole thing over with?"
S06E13,GEORGE,"(to salesman) Well, maybe you could show me something else."
S06E13,SALESMAN,"As I said, it'll be different once we design something specifically for you. But I don't think your friend here is being very helpful."
S06E13,JERRY,"Oh, hey, I'm being helpful. I am the only one being helpful!"
S06E13,SALESMAN,"(getting annoyed) No, I don't think you're being helpful! I think you're being disruptive, and you make it very difficult for your friend here to improve his life!"
S06E13,JERRY,"Hey! I'm trying to prevent my friend from becoming one of those guys people snicker at behind their back, because they look ridiculous! No offence to you personally!"
S06E13,SALESMAN,(angry) All you people with hair think you're so damn superior! You have no idea what it's like. You ever look down in the bottom of your tub and see a fist fulla hair? How'd you like to start your day with that?! (looks ready to punch Jerry)
S06E13,JERRY,All right! Take it easy! Take it easy.
S06E13,GEORGE,(leaps to feet) Jerry!
S06E13,JERRY,I'm sorry.
S06E13,GEORGE,Please. (sits again)
S06E13,GARY,"Hey Jerry, th... (spots George) George, you decided to get a rug! Good for you, Jack!"
S06E13,GEORGE,"Well, I'm, I'm just looking."
S06E13,GARY,"Oh. (to salesman) Uh, Tommy, I'm gonna need a little adjustment."
S06E13,SALESMAN,I'll be right with you.
S06E13,GARY,"Listen, George, I got some bad news. I'm not gonna be able to give you that parking space."
S06E13,GEORGE,What?
S06E13,JERRY,What?
S06E13,GARY,This judge has to use it for some scofflaw. And you know you can't fight City Hall.
S06E13,JERRY,"You know, Gary (slams shut the door) I had a little chat with George the other day..."
S06E13,GARY,(to George) You didn't?!
S06E13,GEORGE,(admiring himself in mirror) I did.
S06E13,JERRY,(advancing on Gary) ...and he told me that that... (becomes indistinct)
S06E13,GARY,(indistinct) I'm not a hundred percent recovered yet!
S06E13,JERRY,Gimme that thing!
S06E13,GEORGE,How's your life? All right?
S06E13,WOMAN,"Yeah, not bad at all."
S06E13,LIPPMAN,"(at lectern) And now, uh, ladies and gentlemen of the press, it is my pleasure to introduce you to Mr Jake Jarmel. (he applauds Jake as he vacates the lectern in his favour)"
S06E13,REPORTER,"So Jake, what's your percentage on this book?"
S06E13,LIPPMAN,"Oh, actually I, uh, I have some very interesting information on that. (puts on glasses) You know, uh, this is a co-venture and as..."
S06E13,JAKE,(notices glasses) Where did you get those?
S06E13,LIPPMAN,"... as such, it..."
S06E13,JAKE,"Those glasses, where did you get those glasses?"
S06E13,LIPPMAN,(confused) Where... what?
S06E13,JAKE,(to Elaine) Is this supposed to be some kind of a joke on me? Because it's not very funny. (to the nonplussed Lippman) Give me those! (yelling) I want the glasses! Give me those!
S06E13,ELAINE,(mouths) 'Scuse me. Have to go (audible) look for some socks.
S06E16,JERRY,Look at you. Why don't you use a fork? You're no good with the sticks.
S06E16,ELAINE,I know. I need a lesson.
S06E16,JERRY,You stink. You know you stink. What is this?
S06E16,ELAINE,Oh. My ballet tickets.
S06E16,JERRY,Oh. Your ballet tickets.
S06E16,ELAINE,"Hey, have you ever been to the ballet?"
S06E16,JERRY,"No, but I've seen people on tiptoes."
S06E16,ELAINE,"You know, I'm going as a beard."
S06E16,JERRY,A beard?
S06E16,ELAINE,"Yeah. This friend of a friend knows this banker guy, he's, I don't know, 30 years, unbelievably gorgeous, of course he's gay."
S06E16,JERRY,Yes.
S06E16,ELAINE,"So anyway his boss has a box at the Met and he invited us to see Swan Lake, which is fine, but he's afraid that his boss can't handle his orientation, so I'm going along as his date."
S06E16,JERRY,Why are you doing this?
S06E16,ELAINE,"Swan Lake, at the Met."
S06E16,KRAMER,"Oh, Chinese food. I knew I smelled something."
S06E16,ELAINE,"Hey, is George still wearing that toupee?"
S06E16,JERRY,Yeah.
S06E16,ELAINE,Doesn't he know how ridiculous he looks in that thing?
S06E16,KRAMER,I think he looks fantastic.
S06E16,ELAINE,"Oh, come on."
S06E16,KRAMER,"No, I never realized what an attractive man he is."
S06E16,GEORGE,"Hey, people, people, people, people, people. Not bad, huh? Excuse me."
S06E16,ELAINE,You look ridiculous in that thing.
S06E16,GEORGE,Is that so? Or could it be that you're just a *little* bit worried that you may have missed the boat?
S06E16,ELAINE,Well I think they might have sutured that thing to your brain.
S06E16,GEORGE,"Ha ha ha ha, oh all right, go ahead, deride, deride if you must. But let me tell you something, with my personality and this set of hair, you know what I am now? I am in the game. I no longer defer to the coifed. I'm a player."
S06E16,KRAMER,"You know I just thought of something. I know this gorgeous woman, she called me up this morning, she's moving into the city, and she asked me if I know of anyone she could meet. Now you can go out with her."
S06E16,JERRY,Well what about me?
S06E16,KRAMER,No I think he's got you beat buddy.
S06E16,GEORGE,So she's gorgeous.
S06E16,KRAMER,"Oh yeah, last time I saw her she was, five years ago."
S06E16,GEORGE,Well have you got a picture?
S06E16,KRAMER,No.
S06E16,GEORGE,"Well, I have to see her."
S06E16,KRAMER,"Hey, I know what we can do. I've got a friend who works over at the police station. He's a composite artist."
S06E16,GEORGE,Really?
S06E16,KRAMER,"Yeah, yeah, maybe I can get him to draw a picture of her for you."
S06E16,GEORGE,Oh I would love that. You think he'd really do it?
S06E16,KRAMER,"Yeah, yeah. I think he will."
S06E16,JERRY,It sounds like an excellent idea.
S06E16,KRAMER,"Hey Jerry, you want this, cause I'm going to give it to a homeless person."
S06E16,GEORGE,Well I'm very excited about this. I've always wanted to see how those sketch artists do it.
S06E16,KRAMER,Here you go brother. Some food for you.
S06E16,HOMELESS MAN,Thank you. You're a good man. Bless you.
S06E16,KRAMER,Now are you going to be here in an hour?
S06E16,HOMELESS MAN,Where am I going?
S06E16,KRAMER,"Oh that's good, that's good. Make the eyes, uh, what's that nut?"
S06E16,LOU,Almond?
S06E16,KRAMER,Almond. Yeah. Make the lips fuller. Poutier.
S06E16,GEORGE,Pouty? I like that.
S06E16,JERRY,You can't go wrong with pouty.
S06E16,GEORGE,I'm excited about the pouty.
S06E16,LOU,All right I think that about does it.
S06E16,KRAMER,"All right George, come on, take a look."
S06E16,GEORGE,"Oh yeah, you were right. She's gorgeous."
S06E16,JERRY,"Hey, Lou, who's that woman over there?"
S06E16,LOU,"Oh, that's Sergeant Tierney. Nice officer. You want to meet her?"
S06E16,GEORGE,Well this worked out okay. So are you going to see the police woman?
S06E16,JERRY,"Yeah, I think I will. I like the idea of having the law on my side."
S06E16,KRAMER,"Hey, man. Enjoy the food?"
S06E16,HOMELESS MAN,Yes I did. Where did the Chinese learn to cook like that?
S06E16,KRAMER,"Oh, listen, I'll take that Tupperware now."
S06E16,HOMELESS MAN,I don't think so.
S06E16,KRAMER,"Woah, woah, that's mine."
S06E16,HOMELESS MAN,You gave it to me.
S06E16,KRAMER,"No, no, I didn't say you could keep it. You see I don't give away tupperware."
S06E16,HOMELESS MAN,You should have said something.
S06E16,KRAMER,I didn't think I had to. Look with a piece of Tupperware you just assume.
S06E16,ROBERT,I've really got to thank you for this.
S06E16,ELAINE,"Well by now, you think people would be a little more open minded."
S06E16,ROBERT,Really. Would you excuse me? I have to run to the bathroom.
S06E16,BOSS' WIFE,"So, um, you and Robert."
S06E16,ELAINE,Yes indeed.
S06E16,BOSS,I'm surprised.
S06E16,ELAINE,Really. Why?
S06E16,BOSS,No reason.
S06E16,ELAINE,"Well believe me this didn't happen overnight. Robert's not exactly a *one* *woman* *man*, if you know what I mean. No sirree Bob. Sure, I mean in a lot of ways, he's a typical guy, he likes his sports, but he counters that side with the side you see here tonight at the ballet, or the pleasure he gets in watching Ms. Liza Minelli belt out a few choice numbers. It's those two halves of his personality that just come together to make him the very special guy that he is."
S06E16,ELAINE,"Oh, hi honey."
S06E16,ELAINE,Oh it was such a great night.
S06E16,JERRY,And did they suspect anything?
S06E16,ELAINE,"No, I was a fantastic beard. I held hands, I called him honey."
S06E16,JERRY,And we discover yet another talent. Posing as a girlfriend for homosexuals.
S06E16,ELAINE,Oh it was such a great night. Oh.
S06E16,JERRY,You said that already.
S06E16,ELAINE,Oh I did?
S06E16,JERRY,Yeah.
S06E16,ELAINE,Oh.
S06E16,JERRY,Oh no. Don't tell me. You like him?
S06E16,ELAINE,He's incredible.
S06E16,JERRY,"Yeah, but?"
S06E16,ELAINE,"Yeah, I know."
S06E16,JERRY,So?
S06E16,ELAINE,What?
S06E16,JERRY,Not conversion. You're thinking conversion?
S06E16,ELAINE,Well it did occur to me.
S06E16,JERRY,You think you can get him to just change teams? He's not going to suddenly switch sides. Forget about it.
S06E16,ELAINE,Why? Is it irrevocable?
S06E16,JERRY,Because when you join that team it's not a whim. He likes his team. He's set with that team.
S06E16,ELAINE,We've got a good team.
S06E16,JERRY,"Yeah, we do. We do have a good team."
S06E16,ELAINE,Why can't he play for us?
S06E16,JERRY,They're only comfortable with *their* equipment.
S06E16,ELAINE,We just got along *so* great.
S06E16,JERRY,Of course you did. Everyone gets along great when there's no possibility of sex.
S06E16,ELAINE,"No, no, no, I sensed something. I did sense something. I perceived a possibility Jerry."
S06E16,JERRY,You realize you're venturing into uncharted waters.
S06E16,ELAINE,I realize that.
S06E16,JERRY,Are you that desperate?
S06E16,ELAINE,Yes I am.
S06E16,JERRY,"So are you going to bring your gun?... All right, then it's settled. First date, no weapons... All right I'll see you then... Okay, bye."
S06E16,JERRY,What are you looking for?
S06E16,KRAMER,Tupperware.
S06E16,JERRY,Sorry. I don't have any tupperware.
S06E16,KRAMER,"I knew this was going to happen. I just made a delicious casserole, but now it won't keep because I have no Tupperware."
S06E16,JERRY,What about a plastic bag?
S06E16,KRAMER,You must be kidding.
S06E16,JERRY,What is the difference?
S06E16,KRAMER,"The patented burp, Jerry. It locks in freshness."
S06E16,GEORGE,So I spoke a little to your little friend Denise last night.
S06E16,KRAMER,"Oh yeah, you talked to her."
S06E16,GEORGE,Yeah for two hours. She's nuts about you.
S06E16,KRAMER,Yeah well we go way back.
S06E16,GEORGE,Why didn't anything happen between you two?
S06E16,KRAMER,Who's to say it didn't?
S06E16,JERRY,So did you describe yourself to her over the phone?
S06E16,GEORGE,Yes I did.
S06E16,JERRY,What did you say to her?
S06E16,GEORGE,What do you think I said?
S06E16,JERRY,I don't know.
S06E16,GEORGE,I told her the truth.
S06E16,JERRY,As you see it?
S06E16,GEORGE,"Yes, as I see it."
S06E16,JERRY,"Did you tell her about, uh, your little hat there?"
S06E16,GEORGE,What hat?
S06E16,JERRY,"You know, you're little hair hat there."
S06E16,GEORGE,No.
S06E16,JERRY,Don't you think she could tell?
S06E16,KRAMER,"No, no, no she can't tell. It's a perfect match. Beautiful job."
S06E16,JERRY,Are you kidding? I could spot that bird's nest two blocks away.
S06E16,GEORGE,You only think that because you know me.
S06E16,JERRY,Have you noticed people staring at your head?
S06E16,GEORGE,I noticed people staring at my head because they like what they see.
S06E16,JERRY,Well I think you should either take it off or tell her about it.
S06E16,KRAMER,"No he's not going to take it off. If he was going to go over there bald, I never would have introduced him."
S06E16,GEORGE,"Look, I guarantee she won't know."
S06E16,KRAMER,"Yeah that's it. All right, I'm going to go down to the precinct. I'm going to have lunch with Lou."
S06E16,JERRY,"Oh, I'll split a cab with you."
S06E16,KRAMER,Hey I'm really sorry about the other day. Really sorry.
S06E16,HOMELESS MAN,Hey that's my coffee!
S06E16,JERRY,Hi Sarge.
S06E16,TIERNEY,"Hi, I'm sorry I'm late. Some of our lineup decoys didn't show. Hey any of you guys want to be in the lineup? Make a quick 50 bucks?"
S06E16,KRAMER,Sure. I will.
S06E16,TIERNEY,Perfect. Just go over there with officer Lampert.
S06E16,SPEAKER,"All of you, turn to the left."
S06E16,SPEAKER,The left.
S06E16,SPEAKER,Now turn to the right.
S06E16,GEORGE,"(thinking to himself) Oh my god, there she is. That's the face, just like the picture."
S06E16,DENISE,George?
S06E16,GEORGE,Yeah. Hi. It's great to meet you.
S06E16,DENISE,Likewise. Have you been waiting long?
S06E16,GEORGE,"No, no. I just got here. A few minutes ago."
S06E16,DENISE,"Good, good."
S06E16,GEORGE,Well why don't you take off your hat and stay awhile.
S06E16,JERRY,What's that?
S06E16,TIERNEY,A polygraph. It's what you civilians call a lie detector test.
S06E16,JERRY,"Oh. Let me ask you, when someone is lying, is it true that their pants are actually on fire?"
S06E16,TIERNEY,If I could tell you the famous faces that have been up here. A certain cast member of Melrose Place.
S06E16,JERRY,Really.
S06E16,TIERNEY,Have you ever seen the show?
S06E16,JERRY,No.
S06E16,TIERNEY,You can admit it Jerry. It's okay.
S06E16,JERRY,I admit it. I don't watch it.
S06E16,TIERNEY,"Hey Lou, maybe we should put him on the poly."
S06E16,JERRY,The poly?
S06E16,TIERNEY,Yeah. I think you've seen it.
S06E16,ELAINE,Melrose Place?
S06E16,JERRY,Yes. Melrose Place.
S06E16,ELAINE,I just didn't know you watched that.
S06E16,JERRY,Well I do.
S06E16,ELAINE,I mean every time I mention it you never say anything or join in the conversation.
S06E16,JERRY,Well maybe I was a little embarrassed.
S06E16,ELAINE,You mean this whole time we could have been discussing Sydney and Michael and Jane...
S06E16,JERRY,"And Billy and Jake and Allison, yes we could have discussed it."
S06E16,ELAINE,Why? Why were you so embarrassed?
S06E16,JERRY,The point is I'm going to be taking this lie detector test and that needle's going to be going wild.
S06E16,ELAINE,That is *so* stupid. Why don't you just confess?
S06E16,JERRY,It's too stupid to confess. Look at what I'm confessing to.
S06E16,ELAINE,So what are you going to do?
S06E16,JERRY,I don't know. Maybe I can beat the machine.
S06E16,ELAINE,"Oh, who do you think you are? Castanza?"
S06E16,JERRY,"Hey you know what? I have access to one of the most deceitful, duplicitous, deceptive minds of our time. Who better to advise me?"
S06E16,ELAINE,Oh god this tastes terrible.
S06E16,JERRY,Did you shake it up?
S06E16,ELAINE,No.
S06E16,JERRY,You gotta shake it up.
S06E16,ELAINE,No. I'm sick of shaking. You've got to shake everything.
S06E16,JERRY,"Yeah, that's a real nuisance. This is killing me."
S06E16,ELAINE,"So, I'm going out tonight with Robert and the boss and his wife."
S06E16,JERRY,So tonight are you going to make the move?
S06E16,ELAINE,"Yeah, I think I might."
S06E16,JERRY,Hey there he is. So what happened? Could she detect it?
S06E16,GEORGE,That's an interesting question.
S06E16,JERRY,How so?
S06E16,GEORGE,How so? I'll tell you how so. She's bald!
S06E16,ELAINE,What do you mean bald?
S06E16,GEORGE,What do you think I mean bald? Bald. Bald bald.
S06E16,JERRY,She's bald?
S06E16,GEORGE,She's bald.
S06E16,ELAINE,Oh come on.
S06E16,GEORGE,Oh come on? No come on. She took off her hat and there she was (waving his hand over his head) hello. It was like I was looking at myself in the mirror.
S06E16,ELAINE,Well maybe she got a haircut or something.
S06E16,GEORGE,"Let me tell you something. No one walks into a beauty parlor and says ""Give me the Larry Fine."""
S06E16,JERRY,Women go bald?
S06E16,ELAINE,"Yeah, I've heard of that. I mean they usually wear a wig."
S06E16,JERRY,Hey.
S06E16,KRAMER,Hey.
S06E16,GEORGE,You fixed me up with a bald woman.
S06E16,KRAMER,Bald?
S06E16,GEORGE,"Yeah, that's right."
S06E16,ELAINE,Do you see the irony here? You're rejecting somebody because they're bald.
S06E16,GEORGE,So?
S06E16,ELAINE,(puts her hands up to her mouth) You're bald!
S06E16,GEORGE,No I'm not. I *was* bald.
S06E16,GEORGE,Elaine.
S06E16,GEORGE,"No, no, no Elaine."
S06E16,ELAINE,(shouting) I don't like this thing. And here's what I'm doing with it.
S06E16,GEORGE,Nooooo.
S06E16,ROBERT,"Hahaha, why'd you start that fight with me?"
S06E16,ELAINE,Well I figured that's what couples do.
S06E16,ROBERT,You almost convinced me we were a couple.
S06E16,ELAINE,Well it was easy. Really.
S06E16,ROBERT,"Well good night, I'll call you tomorrow."
S06E16,ELAINE,"Oh, uh, wait a second. Would you like to come, upstairs?"
S06E16,ROBERT,Upstairs?
S06E16,ELAINE,Yeah. Upstairs?
S06E16,ROBERT,Elaine...
S06E16,ELAINE,"I was hoping you know, that you might be interested in... changing teams?"
S06E16,ROBERT,Changing teams?
S06E16,ELAINE,Have you ever thought about it?
S06E16,ROBERT,But I'm a starting shortstop.
S06E16,ELAINE,"Robert, we need a shortstop. *Real bad*."
S06E16,GEORGE,"I tell you, when she threw that toupee out the window, it was the best thing that ever happened to me. I feel like my old self again. Totally inadequate, completely insecure, paranoid, neurotic, it's a pleasure."
S06E16,JERRY,Good to have you back.
S06E16,GEORGE,And you know what else I've decided to do? I'm going to keep seeing the bald woman.
S06E16,JERRY,She's as good as anybody else.
S06E16,GEORGE,Her scalp was clean. She had a nice skull. There just wasn't a lot of hair on it.
S06E16,JERRY,Yeah you've had like a religious awakening. You're like a bald-again.
S06E16,GEORGE,Going to need a little more coffee here.
S06E16,JERRY,"So George, how do I beat this lie detector?"
S06E16,GEORGE,"I'm sorry, Jerry I can't help you."
S06E16,JERRY,"Come on, you've got the gift. You're the only one that can help me."
S06E16,GEORGE,"Jerry, I can't. It's like saying to Pavorotti, ""Teach me to sing like you."""
S06E16,JERRY,"All right, well I've got to go take this test. I can't believe I'm doing this."
S06E16,GEORGE,"Jerry, just remember. It's not a lie... if you believe it."
S06E16,ELAINE,"Hey, I did it."
S06E16,JERRY,What?
S06E16,ELAINE,I turned him. He defected.
S06E16,JERRY,Get out! (pushes Elaine) How? How did you do that?
S06E16,ELAINE,Because I'm a *woman*. (swiveling her hips) Ba-ba-ba-boom-chicka-boom-chicka-boom-boom- boom.
S06E16,JERRY,"Elaine, do you know what you've done? You've give hope to every woman who's ever said ""Too bad he's gay""."
S06E16,ELAINE,"Well it's a lesson for the kids out there. Anything's possible. Jeromy, I have *hit* the jackpot. The perfect man. Nothing but sex and shopping."
S06E16,LOU,What's your name?
S06E16,JERRY,Jerry Seinfeld.
S06E16,LOU,What is your address?
S06E16,JERRY,129 West 81st street.
S06E16,LOU,Did Kimberly steal Jo's baby?
S06E16,JERRY,I don't know.
S06E16,LOU,Did Billy sleep with Allison's best friend?
S06E16,JERRY,I don't know.
S06E16,LOU,"Did Jane's finance kidnap Sydney and take her to Las Vegas? And if so, did she enjoy it?"
S06E16,JERRY,I don't know.
S06E16,LOU,Did Jane sleep with Michael again?
S06E16,JERRY,"(He hesitates) Yes! That stupid idiot. He left her for Kimberly, he slept with her sister. He tricked her into giving him half her business, and then she goes ahead and sleeps with him again. I mean she's crazy. How could she do something like that? Oh that Jane, she makes me so mad."
S06E16,JERRY,He went back? What do you mean he went back?
S06E16,ELAINE,He went back.
S06E16,JERRY,"I don't understand it. You were having such a great time, the sex, the shopping."
S06E16,ELAINE,"Well here's the thing. Being a woman, I only really have access to the, uh... equipment, what, thirty, forty-five minutes a week. And that's on a good week. How can I be expected to have the same expertise as people who *own* this equipment, and have access to it twenty-four hours a day, their entire lives."
S06E16,JERRY,You can't. That's why they lose very few players.
S06E16,ELAINE,"Yeah, I guess I never really stood a chance."
S06E16,JERRY,"Well there's always a place for you, on our team."
S06E16,ELAINE,Yeah. (teary-eyed) Thanks. Is Melrose Place on?
S06E16,JERRY,Yeah. It's coming on in a few minutes.
S06E16,ELAINE,Okay.
S06E16,JERRY,Hey. Don't worry it hasn't started.
S06E16,ELAINE,"Hey George, I am *really* proud of you. I really do admire what you've done."
S06E16,GEORGE,Do you? That makes me so happy. Elaine's proud of me Jerry.
S06E16,ELAINE,What is the matter?
S06E16,GEORGE,"I got rejected by a bald woman. A bald woman rejected me. Heh, you like that one? A woman with no prospects and no *hair*, told me that I wasn't her type. Apparently *baldy* likes a slimmer guy."
S06E16,KRAMER,Well I'll tell you what I think. I think she saw you with that piece off and was devastated. You blew it boy. You really blew it. And you had to ruin it for him. Didn't you?
S06E16,ELAINE,"I didn't ruin anything. He looked like an idiot. He did, and it made him act like a jerk."
S06E16,JERRY,"All right, shut up, shut up, Melrose Place is coming on."
S06E16,JERRY,"Oh that Michael, I hate him, he's just so smug."
S06E16,KRAMER,"Hey, how you doing Stu? Eddie, my man. You again? Boy, you're a slippery one. You'd better straighten up and fly right buddy boy."
S06E16,MAN,I've got an eyewitness to that jewelry store break-in. Come here. Do you recognize anybody in the lineup?
S06E16,HOMELESS MAN,"That's the guy officer. The guy there in the middle. The tall guy with the, with the high hair. I'd recognize him anywhere."
S06E16,MAN,"Hey you, you with the high hair, step forward."
S06E16,KRAMER,Me?
S06E17,GEORGE,Say it's Saturday night in Spain. They go out dancing. You think they do the flamenco?
S06E17,JERRY,I would think.
S06E17,GEORGE,"So you could call a woman for a date, ask her if she's free for Dinner and a flamenco?"
S06E17,JERRY,(scoffs) You don't flamenco on the first date.
S06E17,GEORGE,"Boy, I wish the flamenco was popular here."
S06E17,JERRY,Yeah? Would you do it?
S06E17,GEORGE,"Yes, I think I would."
S06E17,JERRY,"Well, I knew you'd have an affinity for it, because it's the dance of a very proud people."
S06E17,JERRY,"Hello. (listens) Oh, hi Nana. (listens) What? Oh. Oh, alright, okay. Don't worry about it. (listens) Okay, I'll see you later. Alright, bye."
S06E17,JERRY,I have to go over to my grandmother's.
S06E17,GEORGE,What for?
S06E17,JERRY,I have to open a bottle of ketchup for her.
S06E17,GEORGE,"So, what, no lunch?"
S06E17,JERRY,"No, we have time."
S06E17,GEORGE,Oh. How's she doing?
S06E17,JERRY,"Ah, she's starting to slip a little. Sometimes she has Difficulty distinguishing between the past and the present."
S06E17,GEORGE,"Ah. You know, there's gotta be an easier way to open ketchups. They should make it in a tube."
S06E17,JERRY,Like toothpaste?
S06E17,GEORGE,Ya-hah.
S06E17,JERRY,There's a squeeze ketchup.
S06E17,GEORGE,I've seen squeeze mustard. I've never seen squeeze ketchup.
S06E17,JERRY,"Well, if they make squeeze mustard, doesn't it stand to reason that they make squeeze ketchup?"
S06E17,GEORGE,Not necessarily. Mustard lends itself to the squeeze.
S06E17,JERRY,I really don't see the difference.
S06E17,GEORGE,"Oh, there's a difference. It's subtle."
S06E17,JERRY,It's subtle.
S06E17,GEORGE,"Hey uh, isn't Elaine supposed to meet us?"
S06E17,JERRY,"(looking ahead) Yeah, there she is. Uh-oh."
S06E17,GEORGE,What?
S06E17,JERRY,"Ah, she's with her friend Wendy."
S06E17,GEORGE,"Wendy? Is that the uh, physical therapist?"
S06E17,JERRY,Yeah. I'm on a kiss hello program with her.
S06E17,GEORGE,Really?
S06E17,JERRY,"Yeah. Every time I see her, I gotta kiss her hello. I just did it once, on her birthday, somehow it mushroomed. Now I dread seeing her because of it."
S06E17,ELAINE,(from a distance) Hey.
S06E17,GEORGE,"You know, I'm down to one kiss hello. My aunt Sylvia."
S06E17,JERRY,"Ah, that's fortunate. I really admire that."
S06E17,GEORGE,(surprise) Huh. I never heard you say you admire me for anything.
S06E17,JERRY,"No, I told you I admire your hearing."
S06E17,JERRY,"No, don't slough that off, you have great hearing."
S06E17,GEORGE/JERRY/ELAINE/WENDY,Hey/Hi/Hello (etc.)
S06E17,ELAINE,"(to Wendy) Wendy, George. (to George) Wendy."
S06E17,GEORGE,"You're uh, physical therapist, right?"
S06E17,WENDY,Yes.
S06E17,GEORGE,"You know, I got this little swelling right here. (rolls up his sleeve to expose his wrist) It's kinda painful. What d'you make of it?"
S06E17,ELAINE,(warning) George.
S06E17,WENDY,Have you tried heat and ice on it?
S06E17,GEORGE,"(reluctant) Oh that uh, that seems like a lotta trouble."
S06E17,WENDY,"Well, you could come by my office later, I could work on it for you a little."
S06E17,GEORGE,(happy) Oh! Okay.
S06E17,WENDY,Let me give you my card.
S06E17,GEORGE,"Oh, thank you."
S06E17,WENDY,"Well, I'll see you guys later. (to George) Nice meeting you. Bye Elaine."
S06E17,ELAINE,Bye Wendy. I'm sorry.
S06E17,WENDY,Bye Jerry.
S06E17,JERRY,Bye.
S06E17,ELAINE,(slapping George on the arm) What did you do that for?
S06E17,GEORGE,What?
S06E17,ELAINE,(pinching George's arm) Ask about your arm.
S06E17,GEORGE,I still don't see why I can't ask her about my arm.
S06E17,ELAINE,She's a physical therapist. She doesn't want to have to deal with that outside of the office.
S06E17,GEORGE,Why not?
S06E17,ELAINE,"Because, it is what she does."
S06E17,GEORGE,"I love these people, you can't ask 'em questions. (getting excited) They're so mentally gifted that we mustn't disturb the delicate genius unless it's in the confines of an office. (worked up) When huge sums of money are involved, then the delicate genius can be disturbed!"
S06E17,ELAINE,"George, you got a little something, right here."
S06E17,GEORGE,(wiping the area with a hand) People think they're so important...
S06E17,JERRY,"(adamant) Well, I'm going on record right now that that was my last kiss hello. I am getting off the kiss program with her."
S06E17,ELAINE,Why?
S06E17,JERRY,"Well, you know, frankly, outside of a sexual relationship, I don't see the point to it. I'm not thrilled with all the handshaking either, but one step at a time."
S06E17,GEORGE,(regarding the menu) What're you getting?
S06E17,JERRY,"(to Elaine) And what's with that hairdo, by the way?"
S06E17,ELAINE,"Huh, yeah, I know. It's not very flattering."
S06E17,JERRY,She looks like something out of an old high school yearbook. You should say something to her.
S06E17,ELAINE,"Oh, I could never say anything to her about that."
S06E17,JERRY,Yeah. Kramer's the only person who could say something like that.
S06E17,ELAINE,Yeah. Hah.
S06E17,GEORGE,"Well, just tell Kramer to tell her."
S06E17,ELAINE,"No. If you tell him to do it, he'll never do it."
S06E17,JERRY,"What you have to do is introduce him, and then he'll just come out with it."
S06E17,ELAINE,"(sharp intake of breath) Hoh. Yes, yes, you're right. That's right. I'll bring her over to meet..."
S06E17,ELAINE,(to Kramer) ...Kramer.
S06E17,KRAMER,"Hello, boys and girls."
S06E17,JERRY,Speak of the devil.
S06E17,KRAMER,"Yeah. Hey listen, I uh, I need a picture of you, buddy."
S06E17,JERRY,What for?
S06E17,KRAMER,"Well, I'm uh, I'm putting everybody's picture up in the lobby of our building."
S06E17,JERRY,Why?
S06E17,KRAMER,"So everyone will know everybody's name. See, people are gonna be a lot friendlier."
S06E17,JERRY,"(reluctant) I, I don't want my picture plastered up in the lobby."
S06E17,KRAMER,"Imagine walking by someone on the floor, and you say ""Hey, Carl!"" and he says ""Hey, Jerry!"" You see, that's the kind of society I wanna live in."
S06E17,JERRY,"(still reluctant) Kramer, I don't wanna stop and talk with everyone, every time I go in the building. I just wanna nod and be on my way."
S06E17,KRAMER,(to Elaine) You know your eyeliner's smudged a little. Why do you wear so much eye makeup?
S06E17,ELAINE,"(to Jerry, indicating Kramer) Yeah. This is gonna work out just fine."
S06E17,LEO,Ma! Again with the ketchup? Don't they have 'em in the plastic squeeze containers?
S06E17,LEO,(traditional greeting) Jerry! Hello!
S06E17,JERRY,"Hello, uncle Leo!"
S06E17,LEO,What're you doing here?
S06E17,JERRY,Nana called me to open the ketchup bottle.
S06E17,LEO,"Yeah, me too."
S06E17,NANA,Hello Jerry.
S06E17,JERRY,Hi Nana.
S06E17,LEO,Aren't you gonna kiss her hello?
S06E17,JERRY,Yes. (kisses Nana) Yes of course.
S06E17,NANA,"Ha, well, here's the bottle."
S06E17,LEO,(grabbing the bottle) I'll do it.
S06E17,JERRY,"(also grabbing) What're you doing, I got it."
S06E17,LEO,Give it to me.
S06E17,JERRY,Will you stop it.
S06E17,LEO,"Jerry, will you give me the bottle?"
S06E17,JERRY,Uncle Leo! (releasing his grip) Alright! Take it!
S06E17,NANA,You should let Buddy open it.
S06E17,LEO,Buddy? He lived next door to us forty-five years ago.
S06E17,NANA,"Leo, did you give Helen the fifty dollars?"
S06E17,LEO,What fifty dollars?
S06E17,NANA,"Your father won a thousand dollars at the track last week, and he gave you a hundred, and you were supposed to give fifty dollars to your sister."
S06E17,LEO,"Ma, dad died in nineteen-sixty-two."
S06E17,LEO,(laughing off Nana's confusion) Believe me. I don't owe your mother fifty dollars.
S06E17,JERRY,I'm just not getting any hot water.
S06E17,JULIO,"Hey, believe me, I know there's nothing worse than when your shower's not working. I'm gonna take care of it as soon as I can, Jerry."
S06E17,JERRY,"Thanks, Julio."
S06E17,JULIO,Awright.
S06E17,JERRY,Huh?
S06E17,KRAMER,"(surprised) Hey, hey hey hey. Hello!"
S06E17,JERRY,What's going on here?
S06E17,KRAMER,"(evasive) Ohh, nothing, nothing."
S06E17,JERRY,"(suspicious) Well, then what're you doing?"
S06E17,KRAMER,"Oh, I, I need a pen."
S06E17,JERRY,What for?
S06E17,KRAMER,"Well, I'm making out my will. Oh, I got a big slice of dough for you, buddy. And you too, Elaine, I haven't forgotten you."
S06E17,JERRY,"(accusingly) You're looking for a picture of me, aren't you?"
S06E17,KRAMER,You got that straight.
S06E17,JERRY,"I told you, forget it."
S06E17,KRAMER,"Oh, come on, Jerry. If everybody knew everybody, we wouldn't have the problems we have in the world today. Well, you don't rob somebody, if you know their name!"
S06E17,JERRY,You're robbing me.
S06E17,KRAMER,"Well, I'm gonna get your picture, and you're gonna participate in my program."
S06E17,ELAINE,Wha... W.. Are you going home?
S06E17,KRAMER,Yeah.
S06E17,ELAINE,"Uh, could you come back in about five minutes?"
S06E17,KRAMER,Why?
S06E17,ELAINE,No reason. (big smile) Just wanna see you again.
S06E17,JERRY,(removing his coat) So? Are you sure Wendy's coming?
S06E17,ELAINE,"Yeah, she'll be here any second."
S06E17,JERRY,"Well, this'll be a very interesting experiment to see if Kramer says something. You sure you wanna go through with this?"
S06E17,ELAINE,"Listen, Jerry. She never dates, and I know it's because of her hair."
S06E17,JERRY,"Hello. Oh, hi mom. Yeah, I was at Nana's yesterday. I had to help her open a ketchup bottle. Hey, mom, let me ask you a question. Do you remember when you were a kid, your father winning like a thousand dollars at the track? (listens) Really? Did you know he gave uncle Leo a hundred dollars, and he was supposed to give you fifty? (listens) How do I know? Because Nana doesn't know what year it is, and she thinks this just happened. (listens) Well, I think you should. Okay, bye."
S06E17,MORTY,Do you know what the interest on that fifty dollars comes to over fifty-three years?
S06E17,HELEN,"Oh, Morty, please."
S06E17,MORTY,"Six hundred and sixty-three dollars and forty-five cents. And that's figuring conservatively at five percent interest, over fifty-three years, compounded quarterly. Or, if you put it into a ten-year T-bill..."
S06E17,HELEN,"Morty, will you stop it!"
S06E17,MORTY,"(determined) Well, he's not getting away with this!"
S06E17,JERRY,Yeah?
S06E17,WENDY (O.C.),Wendy.
S06E17,JERRY,Come on up.
S06E17,ELAINE,"Well, this is it. Shall I go get Kramer?"
S06E17,JERRY,"No no, he'll come in. Well, this is gonna be my first opportunity to not kiss her hello."
S06E17,ELAINE,What is the big deal about putting your lips on somebody's face?
S06E17,JERRY,"It's the obligation, you know? As soon as this person comes in, you know you have to do this. I mean, if you could, say, touch a breast as part of the kiss hello, then I think I could see the value in it a little better."
S06E17,ELAINE,How 'bout an intercourse hello? How would that be?
S06E17,JERRY,"Elaine, now you're being ridiculous."
S06E17,ELAINE,(indicating) That's her. That's her.
S06E17,ELAINE/WENDY,Hi/Hey.
S06E17,JERRY,(muffled) Hi Wendy.
S06E17,WENDY,"Oh, hi Jerry."
S06E17,JERRY,(muffled) Would you like something to drink?
S06E17,WENDY,Sure.
S06E17,JERRY,(muffled) There you go.
S06E17,WENDY,(taking the bottle) Ah.
S06E17,JERRY,"Oh, look at that. I'm almost outta Klondike bars."
S06E17,JERRY,"So, how's everything going?"
S06E17,WENDY,"Oh, okay. Oh, your friend George came by the office the other day, and then yesterday he cancelled on me."
S06E17,JERRY,"Oh, yeah, he had to take his mother to the chiropodist."
S06E17,ELAINE,"Oh, you hear that? That must be Kramer."
S06E17,KRAMER,Hey! Jerry!
S06E17,JERRY,"C'mon, that's not fair!"
S06E17,KRAMER,I told you I was gonna get it.
S06E17,JERRY,"No, c'mon Kramer. (crossing to Kramer) Gimme that picture."
S06E17,KRAMER,(holding the picture away from Jerry) Aagh. No no no no no.
S06E17,JERRY,"(throws up his hands) Alright, fine. Put my picture up. What do I care?"
S06E17,ELAINE,"Uh, Kramer. Kramer, I'd like you to meet my friend Wendy."
S06E17,KRAMER,"Oh, hello."
S06E17,WENDY,(holds out her hand) Hi.
S06E17,KRAMER,(shaking hands) Yeah.
S06E17,KRAMER,"(points) You know, I really like that hairdo."
S06E17,WENDY,(flattered) Oh. Thank you. I actually was thinking it might be time for a change.
S06E17,ELAINE,"(hopeful) Oh, you were?"
S06E17,WENDY,"Well, I..."
S06E17,KRAMER,"(interrupting) Oh, no no no. You don't wanna do that. No no. Nobody wears it like that."
S06E17,ELAINE,"Kramer, if she wants to change her hair..."
S06E17,KRAMER,"No, no. you'd be a damn fool to change it. It's very becoming."
S06E17,WENDY,"Oh, well."
S06E17,WENDY,"(laughs, flattered) Oh, ho."
S06E17,WENDY,"So, who's that friend of yours? That guy that came in."
S06E17,ELAINE,"Oh, Kramer."
S06E17,WENDY,Yeah. Does he have a girlfriend?
S06E17,ELAINE,You wanna go out with him?
S06E17,WENDY,"Well, why not?"
S06E17,ELAINE,"Well, it's just that... uh, I don't..."
S06E17,WENDY,"What, is there anything wrong with him?"
S06E17,WENDY,Elaine?
S06E17,ELAINE,I'm just thinking about the question.
S06E17,GEORGE,"You know, my arm feels a lot better. That Wendy really knows her stuff. (he writes out a cheque)"
S06E17,RECEPTIONIST,(perky) She is super. Same time tomorrow.
S06E17,GEORGE,"(tearing out cheque) Yeah, same time. (hands over cheque) There you go."
S06E17,RECEPTIONIST,"Oh. Ah, you owe a hundred and fifty."
S06E17,GEORGE,What for?
S06E17,RECEPTIONIST,"Well, you cancelled on Tuesday, and our policy is ""twenty-four hours notice, for all cancellations""."
S06E17,GEORGE,"(agitated) Well, I, I couldn't come. I, I had to drive my mother to, to the chiropodist."
S06E17,WENDY,What's the problem?
S06E17,GEORGE,(harassed) Are you aware that I'm being charged for Tuesday's appointment? I had to take my mother to the chiropodist.
S06E17,WENDY,"Well, I'm sorry, that's our policy."
S06E17,GEORGE,"(after Wendy and to the receptionist) Oh, you have a policy! (to the world at large) The delicate genius has a policy! George heads for the door."
S06E17,RECEPTIONIST,So. Will you be here tomorrow?
S06E17,GEORGE,"Well, it's less than twenty-four hours, so I guess I have to!"
S06E17,KRAMER,Hey! (indicating photos) So what d'you think? You like it?
S06E17,JERRY,"Oh my god! Look at that picture, it's terrible..."
S06E17,JERRY,...You can't put that picture up.
S06E17,KRAMER,"Well, it's not a beauty contest. It's just a way for people to get to know one another."
S06E17,STEVE,Hey Cosmo.
S06E17,KRAMER,Hey...
S06E17,KRAMER,"...Steve. (to Jerry) Ah, you see?"
S06E17,ELAINE,"Hey Kramer, my friend Wendy wants to go out with you."
S06E17,KRAMER,"(interested) Well, how do you do?"
S06E17,MARY,"Hello, (finds the right photo) Jerry."
S06E17,JERRY,"Oh. Hello, uh (looks for and finds the photo) Mary."
S06E17,MARY,"You know, I've seen you so many times and now we can finally talk to each other."
S06E17,KRAMER,(keen) What was I telling you? Isn't this nice?
S06E17,JERRY,(not really) Yeah.
S06E17,MARY,"Jerry. You know, could you help me with a package?"
S06E17,JERRY,"Oh, sure, yeah."
S06E17,MARY,Thank you.
S06E17,JERRY,"Oh, no!"
S06E17,JERRY,You see? That's just what I need. More kissing!
S06E17,ELAINE,"(laughs) Hee, hee, hee. Hee hee hee..."
S06E17,JERRY,What is so funny?
S06E17,ELAINE,"Nothing, nothing. (laughs out loud)"
S06E17,JERRY,"Hello. Oh, hi mom. (listens) What? Oh my... He didn't?! He couldn't! (listens) Alright, I will. (listens) Okay, bye."
S06E17,JERRY,(aghast) Uncle Leo put Nana in a home!
S06E17,ELAINE,Why?
S06E17,JERRY,(suspicious) I don't know. Maybe to keep her quiet.
S06E17,JOAN,Hi Jerry. (she kisses Jerry) Mmmwah.
S06E17,JERRY,(not as eager) Hi Joan.
S06E17,JOAN,How you doing?
S06E17,JERRY,Pretty good.
S06E17,JOAN,Just pretty good? Not great?
S06E17,JERRY,"Okay, great."
S06E17,JOAN,Are you happy?
S06E17,JERRY,"Oh, I'm delighted."
S06E17,JOAN,Okay. Have a nice day.
S06E17,JERRY,You too.
S06E17,LOUISE,Hi Jerry.
S06E17,JERRY,"Hi, Louise."
S06E17,KRAMER,Hey.
S06E17,JERRY,"Ah, well. Thank you very much!"
S06E17,KRAMER,For what?
S06E17,JERRY,"(agitated) For putting my picture up on that wall! I'm like Richard Dawson down there now. And every person I see engages me in this long, boring, tedious, conversation. I can't even get out of the building!"
S06E17,KRAMER,"You should be thanking me for liberating you from your world of loneliness and isolation. Now, you're part of a family."
S06E17,JERRY,Family?
S06E17,KRAMER,Yeah.
S06E17,JERRY,"You think I want another family? My father's demanding my uncle pay interest on fifty dollars he was supposed to give my mother in nineteen-forty-one, and my uncle put my nana in a home to try and shut her up! And I tell you another thing, Cosmo Kramer, whatever you wanna be called. The kissing thing is over. There's no more kissing, and I don't care what the consequences are."
S06E17,RECEPTIONIST,"Oh, hi. Mister Costanza, we were trying to get in touch with you. Wendy can't make her appointment."
S06E17,GEORGE,What d'you mean?
S06E17,RECEPTIONIST,She had some personal affair she had to attend to. I left a message on your machine. You didn't get it?
S06E17,GEORGE,When did you leave the message?
S06E17,RECEPTIONIST,Few hours ago.
S06E17,GEORGE,"(pointedly) Oh, I'm sorry, I require twenty-four hours notice for a cancellation. Now, as I see it, you owe me seventy-five dollars."
S06E17,RECEPTIONIST,"Look, Mister Costanza..."
S06E17,GEORGE,"Will that be cash, or cheque?"
S06E17,WENDY,I am really glad I took the day off.
S06E17,ELAINE,"Oh, yeah, there's nothing better than skiing."
S06E17,WENDY,Yeah. I hope my clients weren't too upset.
S06E17,ELAINE,"Ugh, the hell with 'em."
S06E17,ELAINE,What're you stopping here for?
S06E17,WENDY,I'm dropping you off.
S06E17,ELAINE,"(pointing) Oh, no, I'm three more blocks."
S06E17,WENDY,"Yeah, but if I take you to your door, then I have to go all the way around Central Park West, back to Columbus, you know it's all one way..."
S06E17,ELAINE,"Yeah, but it's only three blocks."
S06E17,WENDY,Right. It's only three blocks.
S06E17,ELAINE,"(unbuckling her seatbelt) Alright, well..."
S06E17,ELAINE,"She'd driven me a hundred and twenty miles and, all of a sudden, three blocks from my door, she decides this trip is over. Isn't that strange?"
S06E17,JERRY,"Yes, it's very strange. Very strange."
S06E17,ELAINE,"I've never heard of anything like this. I mean, it's almost as if I was hitch-hiking and she says ""Well, this is as far as I can take you."""
S06E17,JERRY,"I tell you. If you were hitch-hiking, you'd never get into a car with someone with a hairdo like that."
S06E17,ELAINE,"I had to carry my skis, and my boots and my poles. I think I pinched a nerve in my shoulder."
S06E17,JERRY,You should have her work on it for you.
S06E17,ELAINE,"Yeah, alright, I gotta go."
S06E17,MAR,Hi Jerry.
S06E17,JERRY,Hi Mary.
S06E17,JERRY,"Uh, listen. I decided I can't kiss hello anymore. I'm sorry. It's nothing personal...."
S06E17,JERRY,...It just makes me a little uncomfortable and I can't do it. I'm sorry.
S06E17,LOU,Hi Jerry.
S06E17,JERRY,Hi Louise...
S06E17,JERRY,"...I was just telling Mary how I'm not gonna be doing the kiss hello thing anymore. (continues backing away) I'm sorry. I just can't do it. It's nothing personal, it's just I'm not really able to do it and uh, I'm sorry."
S06E17,JERRY,(as the elevator doors close) Thank you for your cooperation.
S06E17,JERRY,Hello.
S06E17,HELEN (V.O),Jerry?
S06E17,JERRY,"Hi mom. So, what's happening with uncle Leo? Is he paying you?"
S06E17,HELEN,"Well, he said no. He said we had no proof."
S06E17,MORTY,"No proof? We'll get him. He's a crook, sooner or later, he'll slip up."
S06E17,HELEN,"Uh, anyway, I want you to go check on Nana at the home."
S06E17,JERRY,"Okay, I will."
S06E17,MORTY,"D'you realise, an above-average performing growth mutual fund for fifty-three years..."
S06E17,KRAMER,What's up?
S06E17,JERRY,"(locking his door) Oh, I gotta go visit my nana in the nursing home."
S06E17,KRAMER,Oh.
S06E17,JERRY,"Hey, Kramer, look at this."
S06E17,JERRY,Look at my picture!
S06E17,JERRY,I've been defaced!
S06E17,KRAMER,"Hey, don't you worry buddy. I made double prints."
S06E17,JACK,Hey. Hi Cosmo.
S06E17,KRAMER,"Oh, hey, Jack. How you doing?"
S06E17,JERRY,Hi Jack.
S06E17,JERRY,"Hey, Julio. I was wondering, could you get to that shower today, You think?"
S06E17,JULIO,"Oh, I see. When you need something done, you're very friendly to people, huh?"
S06E17,JERRY,"(defensive) No no, that's not true!"
S06E17,JULIO,"(accusing) Well, I think it is! It's a big building, Seinfeld, maybe I'll get to it someday. After I take care of the people who're civil to each other."
S06E17,NURSE,"Yeah, she's upstairs, playing cards."
S06E17,JERRY,"You know, she really doesn't belong here. My uncle put her here, Because he's trying to prove he doesn't owe my mother fifty dollars."
S06E17,NURSE,"Well, she seems very happy. She met an old friend who used to live next door to her."
S06E17,JERRY,Buddy?
S06E17,NURSE,"Yes, that's his name. He's right over there."
S06E17,WENDY,"(smiling) I'm sorry, I don't owe you anything. I had some personal business that day."
S06E17,GEORGE,"(irascible) Oh, I see. So your time is more valuable than mine. Is that it? You're a delicate genius!"
S06E17,WENDY,A delicate genius?
S06E17,GEORGE,Elaine?
S06E17,ELAINE,(surprised) George!
S06E17,GEORGE,(leaving) Hah. Good luck.
S06E17,WENDY,What's going on?
S06E17,ELAINE,"(feeling her arm) Wendy, I injured my shoulder, Wednesday, when you dropped me off and I had to carry my skis, and my boots, and my poles and everything, all the way home. I'm, I'm having trouble lifting my arm. Do you think you could give me some treatment?"
S06E17,WENDY,"Oh sure. You have insurance, right?"
S06E17,ELAINE,(shocked) Insurance? You're charging me?
S06E17,GEORGE,"Wednesday? That's your personal business?! (stalks over to the counter) Skiing?! (angry) So let people suffer, while you're shushing all over a mountain?"
S06E17,WENDY,How did you hear that?
S06E17,GEORGE,I hear everything.
S06E17,WENDY,"I mean, why don't you two just take your business elsewhere, hmm?"
S06E17,ELAINE,"Oh, huh huh, that is a good idea. C'mon George."
S06E17,GEORGE,Yeah. Let's go.
S06E17,ELAINE,"(pointedly) And you know, you might wanna do something about that hair."
S06E17,WENDY,"Why, what's wrong with my hair?"
S06E17,ELAINE,"Huh, I think it's a little old-fashioned. Don't you? (to receptionist) Uh, tell her."
S06E17,RECEPTIONIST,She's right.
S06E17,JERRY,So you were with him that day at the track?
S06E17,BUDDY,Oh yeah. He won a thousand dollars. His son was there too.
S06E17,JERRY,Leo?
S06E17,BUDDY,"Yeah, that's it. Leo. Ooh, what an obnoxious little kid. He used to steal my soda bottles. and cash 'em in for the deposits, uh?"
S06E17,JERRY,Is that so?
S06E17,BUDDY,"And, after your grandfather hit the daily double, he gave him a hundred dollars, and told him to give fifty to his sister. His sister? Why I tell you he shoulda give it to me for all the bottles he took!"
S06E17,JERRY,"Well, that's very interesting."
S06E17,JERRY,(standing) Uncle Leo! I just met an old acquaintance of yours. (indicates Buddy) You remember Buddy. He just told me quite a story about you and Grandpa at the track.
S06E17,LEO,(defensive) One second...
S06E17,JERRY,(with a triumphant point) You're busted!
S06E17,JERRY,"Hey, Steve. How you doing?"
S06E17,JERRY,"Hey, Jeff. What's happening?"
S06E17,JERRY,"Mary! Oh, Mary! Give us a kiss."
S06E17,JERRY,"Don't be like that, Mary. C'mon, I made a mistake!"
S06E17,MARY,"(contemptuous) Look, why don't you do everybody a favour, and just get out of this building? (angry) Nobody wants you here. Nobody!"
S06E17,JEFF,Hi Mary.
S06E17,MARY,Hi Jeff. How are you?
S06E17,MARY,Hi Pete. How you doing?
S06E17,PETE,"Hey, let's go get some coffee."
S06E17,JEFF,Great idea.
S06E17,MARY,"Oh, that'd be great."
S06E17,JERRY,"Oh, Paul, could you hold that door..."
S06E17,KRAMER,Hi.
S06E17,JERRY,Hey. Could I use your shower?
S06E17,KRAMER,"What, again? You took one this morning."
S06E17,JERRY,"(pleading) I got a date. C'mon, please."
S06E17,KRAMER,I know but I... (waves toward the interior of his apartment) Little problem.
S06E17,KRAMER,(leaning to look round Kramer) Wendy here?
S06E17,KRAMER,"No no no. She changed her hairstyle, (pulls a face) it's terrible. No, we're done."
S06E17,GUY,I'll go get some more beer.
S06E17,KRAMER,"Oh yeah, yeah, great. (calling after the guy) And get some of those blue corn chips."
S06E17,KRAMER,Hey.
S06E17,STEFANIE,Hi Cosmo.
S06E17,KRAMER,Hi.
S06E17,STEFANIE,(kisses Kramer hello) Mmmwah.
S06E17,KRAMER,"Ooh, I like that."
S06E17,JERRY,(impressed) Who's that?
S06E17,KRAMER,Stefanie. 2-G.
S06E17,JERRY,Oh man. Looks like you got quite a few people here.
S06E17,KRAMER,"Yeah yeah. Well uh, you know, I'd invite you in, but uhm... you know."
S06E17,JERRY,"(rueful acceptance) Oh, yeah, I understand."
S06E18,DOORMAN,"Whoah, whoah, whoah. (rises and turns to Jerry) May I help you?"
S06E18,JERRY,"(indicates with his thumb) Yeah, I'm just going up to see Elaine Benes."
S06E18,DOORMAN,(unfriendly smile) Benes? (moves toward Jerry) No-one here by that name.
S06E18,JERRY,"Oh, she's uh, she's house-sitting for Mr. Pitt."
S06E18,DOORMAN,"Oh. House-sitting, mmm."
S06E18,JERRY,Yeah.
S06E18,DOORMAN,"What're you, the boyfriend? Here for a... quickie?"
S06E18,JERRY,Can I just go up?
S06E18,DOORMAN,"Oh, I get it. Why waste time making small talk with the doorman? I should just shut up and do my job, opening the door for you."
S06E18,JERRY,How 'bout those Knicks?
S06E18,DOORMAN,"Oh, I see. On the sports page..."
S06E18,JERRY,Yeah.
S06E18,DOORMAN,"...What makes you think I wasn't reading the Wall Street page? Oh, I know, because I'm the uneducated doorman."
S06E18,KRAMER,"So, you think your parents'll get back together?"
S06E18,GEORGE,"I hope so. I can't take him living with me much longer. He makes this kasha, it stinks up the whole house."
S06E18,KRAMER,"Hey, George, stick 'em up."
S06E18,GEORGE,What?
S06E18,KRAMER,For these German tourists. Pretend that I'm robbing you.
S06E18,GEORGE,Why?
S06E18,KRAMER,So these people can go back home and tell their friends they saw a real New York mugging. It'll give them a thrill.
S06E18,KRAMER,"Awright, hands up, porky!"
S06E18,KRAMER,"That's it. Now, gimme your wallet. Got it in here, huh, fat boy!"
S06E18,KRAMER,(aggressive) Is that all you got?! Hah? Is that all you got?!
S06E18,GEORGE,"Alright, that's enough."
S06E18,KRAMER,"I'll tell you when it's enough! (he releases George) Alright, now you better not say anything, or I'll stalk you!"
S06E18,ELAINE,"Where've you been? We're gonna miss the movie, let's go."
S06E18,JERRY,I am not going back down there. I can't face that guy again.
S06E18,ELAINE,What guy?
S06E18,JERRY,The doorman. I don't wanna play anymore of his mindgames. What time does he get off?
S06E18,ELAINE,Six. But then the night doorman comes on. He's much scarier. (scary noise) Whugh! (laughs) Ha-ha.
S06E18,JERRY,"Well, it's almost six now. Can't we just wait til he goes home?"
S06E18,ELAINE,(unhappy) I...
S06E18,JERRY,We'll still make the movie.
S06E18,ELAINE,"(accepting) Okay, okay."
S06E18,GEORGE,"What'd you do today, dad?"
S06E18,FRANK,"Today, I went record shopping in Greenwich Village. I bought this record, but I can't seem to find the hi-fi."
S06E18,GEORGE,I don't have a hi-fi.
S06E18,FRANK,Didn't I give you my old record player?
S06E18,GEORGE,(leaving to the bedroom) I gave it to Cosmo.
S06E18,FRANK,Cosmo? Who's Cosmo?
S06E18,KRAMER,I'm Cosmo.
S06E18,FRANK,"Well, I want it back. I wanna listen to that cha-cha record."
S06E18,KRAMER,"(little dance) One-two, cha-cha-cha."
S06E18,GEORGE,"(coming back in) Alright, alright. Can we go out and eat?"
S06E18,FRANK,(putting down the bowl) Lemme change my shirt.
S06E18,ELAINE,"Jerry, it's six. (claps her hands) Let's go."
S06E18,JERRY,"Uh, that doorman's still milling around outside. He's very peculiar."
S06E18,ELAINE,"No, don't..."
S06E18,JERRY,"(picks up phone) Hello? (listens) Oh, hi Mr. Pitt."
S06E18,ELAINE,(quietly) Give that to me.
S06E18,ELAINE,(taking the phone) Hello Mr. Pitt. How's Scotland?
S06E18,MR. PITT,"(concerned) Elaine, are you having a party?"
S06E18,ELAINE,"A party. Oh no, that was just my stupid friend Jerry."
S06E18,JERRY,"Alright, he just left. We can go."
S06E18,MR. PITT,(stern) Because there's to be no entertaining while I'm gone.
S06E18,ELAINE,"Believe me, we're not entertained. We were just leaving. (to Jerry) Oh, can you grab those empty bottles for me."
S06E18,MR. PITT,I need to know what's in the mail.
S06E18,ELAINE,"Oh, well, Mr. Pitt, there's really nothing that can't wait. We're trying to catch a movie."
S06E18,MR. PITT,"(resolute) Well, you better catch the later show, because I need to know what's in the mail."
S06E18,ELAINE,"Alright. (to Jerry, upset) I can't go."
S06E18,ELAINE,"...Uhm, the new Time magazine. The new People..."
S06E18,MR. PITT (O.C.),"(piqued interest) Oh, who's on the cover?"
S06E18,DOORMAN,"Hey, buddy."
S06E18,JERRY,(surprise) You? Wh...what're you doing here? You work at this building too?
S06E18,DOORMAN,"Ah, sure. Poor doorman has to work two jobs to put food on the table for mother and baby. (supercilious) No, I live here. That's okay, isn't it?"
S06E18,JERRY,So you work all day as a doorman at one building. Then you come home and stand outside your own building?
S06E18,DOORMAN,You got a problem with that?
S06E18,JERRY,"Look, I'm not going in your building. I really don't have to talk to you. Goodbye."
S06E18,DOORMAN,"(calling after Jerry) You really think you're better than me, don't you?!"
S06E18,GEORGE,My father opened his shirt...
S06E18,JERRY,"Yeah, and?"
S06E18,GEORGE,"(nods to Kramer) Tell him, Kramer."
S06E18,KRAMER,(matter of fact) He had breasts.
S06E18,JERRY,"What d'you mean, breasts?"
S06E18,GEORGE,(waves his hands) Big breasts!
S06E18,JERRY,So what? A lot of older men have that.
S06E18,KRAMER,"No, not these. These were real hooters."
S06E18,GEORGE,I was throwing up all night. It was like my own personal Crying Game.
S06E18,KRAMER,"Well, maybe you're gonna get 'em too, George."
S06E18,GEORGE,"(worried) Yeah, that's right. What if it's a genetic thing, like father like son?"
S06E18,JERRY,"But, your father's not bald."
S06E18,GEORGE,"No, no no. That skips a generation. The baldness gene comes from your grandfather."
S06E18,JERRY,Then I suppose the bosom gene comes from your grandmother.
S06E18,KRAMER,"You know, Frank can't be too comfortable with those things clanging around. He should wear something for support."
S06E18,GEORGE,You mean like a bra?
S06E18,KRAMER,A bra is for ladies. I'm talking about a support undergarment specifically designed for men.
S06E18,JERRY,"Boy, that brain never stops working, does it?"
S06E18,KRAMER,"I tell you, I'm gonna go noodle with this."
S06E18,BUXOM WOMAN,"(indicating her shirt with her finger) Hey, we're twins."
S06E18,GEORGE,(thinking she means the breasts) What!!
S06E18,BUXOM WOMAN,Our shirts. They're the same.
S06E18,GEORGE,"Oh, Huh, imagine that."
S06E18,ELAINE,(to Jerry) What? What'd you say to the doorman?
S06E18,JERRY,What? Nothing.
S06E18,ELAINE,"(sitting beside Jerry) He claims that you followed him home, and started harassing him."
S06E18,JERRY,What has this guy got a personal vendetta with me?! What'd I do to him? 'Cos I asked him about the Knicks?
S06E18,ELAINE,"Hey, did you make the movie?"
S06E18,JERRY,No.
S06E18,ELAINE,You wanna go tonight? You can pick me up.
S06E18,JERRY,"Alright. Can we go to a later show, so he's off his shift when I come by?"
S06E18,ELAINE,Ugh. So now we have to rearrange our lives to avoid the doorman?
S06E18,JERRY,"Yes, we do."
S06E18,ELAINE,What is wrong with George?
S06E18,JERRY,He's... trying to get something off his chest.
S06E18,GEORGE,"(agitated) Alright, I gotta try and talk my mother into taking him off my hands."
S06E18,DOORMAN,Help you?
S06E18,JERRY,(jumps in surprise) Hoh! What're you doing here? You're supposed to be gone.
S06E18,DOORMAN,"I traded shifts with the night doorman. He had some personal affairs to attend to. You see, my fellow doorman and I watch out for each other. We don't stab each other in the back, like people in your world."
S06E18,JERRY,"(trying to ease the tension) Look, I don't want any trouble. I don't have a doorman in my building. I guess I'm just not used to talking to them. I'd really just like to be friends."
S06E18,DOORMAN,You wanna be friends?
S06E18,JERRY,I'd like to be.
S06E18,DOORMAN,"Then watch the door for a minute, would you?"
S06E18,JERRY,What?
S06E18,DOORMAN,"Yeah, I just wanna run and get a beer. I'll be back in a minute."
S06E18,JERRY,Wha...? Wai... wait a second. What do I do?
S06E18,DOORMAN,"It's not brain surgery. You open the door for people who live here. And, if they don't live here, don't let them in. (takes off his hat) Here. (putting it on Jerry's head) Wear that."
S06E18,JERRY,Oh.
S06E18,JERRY,"(to the man in the elevator) Hey, hey. Wait a second. Hey! Hello!"
S06E18,JERRY,"Hey, hey, wait a second. You live here?"
S06E18,MR. GREEN,"(indignant) Of course I live here. I've lived here for twenty years. Now, if you don't let me in, I'm going to call the police and have you arrested."
S06E18,JERRY,(after the guy) You think you're better than me?
S06E18,DELIVERY GUY,(indicating) You have to sign for it.
S06E18,JERRY,"Oh, right."
S06E18,DELIVERY GUY,"(with a smile) Hey, how 'bout those Knicks, huh?"
S06E18,JERRY,"(dismissive) Yeah, yeah, yeah."
S06E18,KRAMER,"Hey. I uh, brought back your record player, huh."
S06E18,FRANK,"Thank you, Kramer."
S06E18,KRAMER,Yeah.
S06E18,FRANK,(indicating a chair) Put it over there.
S06E18,KRAMER,"So, how you feeling?"
S06E18,FRANK,Tired.
S06E18,KRAMER,Uh huh. Your back hurt?
S06E18,FRANK,How did you know?
S06E18,KRAMER,"Well, it's obvious, you know. You're carrying a lot of extra baggage up there."
S06E18,FRANK,"(looks down, and indicates his chest) Up here?"
S06E18,KRAMER,"Oh, yeah. Top floor. (sits beside Frank) Listen, Frank, have you ever considered wearing something for support? Now, look at this. (reaches into his pocket) Mind you, this is just a prototype."
S06E18,FRANK,You want me to wear a bra?!
S06E18,KRAMER,"No, no. A bra is for ladies."
S06E18,KRAMER,"Meet, the bro."
S06E18,ESTELLE,"So, is your father excited about coming home?"
S06E18,ESTELLE,George?
S06E18,GEORGE,(broaching a subject) Hey mom. What kind of woman was grandma?
S06E18,ESTELLE,All of a sudden you're interested in your grandmother?
S06E18,GEORGE,"Well, you know. You get to a certain point, you wanna know about your roots."
S06E18,ESTELLE,She was a lovely woman.
S06E18,GEORGE,Yuh. What about physically?
S06E18,ESTELLE,Physically?
S06E18,GEORGE,"Yeah, you know, what'd she uh, look like?"
S06E18,ESTELLE,"Well, you've seen pictures."
S06E18,GEORGE,(to himself) You can't tell much from those pictures.
S06E18,ESTELLE,So what?
S06E18,GEORGE,"Was she uh, was she a big, uh woman?"
S06E18,ESTELLE,"Big? No, just my height."
S06E18,GEORGE,Bosomy?
S06E18,ESTELLE,Bosomy? You wanna know if your grandmother was bosomy?!
S06E18,GEORGE,"(trying to laugh it off) No, I was just wondering. The information could be relevant."
S06E18,ESTELLE,Where do you get your genes from?!
S06E18,GEORGE,(to himself) That's what I'd like to know.
S06E18,ELAINE,I can't believe you left your post.
S06E18,JERRY,He left me there. You see the mind games?
S06E18,ELAINE,"(to one of the tenants) Hey, what's up? What's going on here?"
S06E18,TENANT 1,Somebody stole the couch out of the lobby.
S06E18,TENANT 2,Where's the doorman? How come someone wasn't watching the door?
S06E18,ELAINE,"(quietly to Jerry) Jerry, let's get out of here."
S06E18,JERRY,Yeah.
S06E18,ESTELLE,"(shocked) Oh, my god!"
S06E18,ELAINE,What were you doing watching the door anyway?
S06E18,JERRY,He asked me to. We were getting along.
S06E18,ELAINE,"(thinking) You know, my fingerprints are all over this. That doorman knows you're a friend of mine. He'll tell that co-op lady, she'll tell Mr. Pitt... Jerry, I'm in this too deep."
S06E18,JERRY,"Don't you find it odd that as soon as he leaves, the couch gets stolen? Maybe he's setting me up!"
S06E18,ELAINE,"(taking command) Alright, shut up. Shut up. Just let me think. I gotta think. We gotta get our story straight."
S06E18,JERRY,"Alright, well what if we say..."
S06E18,ELAINE,"Alright, (claps hands) here it is. This is what we'll tell 'em. You came to pick me up..."
S06E18,JERRY,I came to pick you up.
S06E18,ELAINE,Yeah. That's what I just said.
S06E18,JERRY,I know. I was just...
S06E18,ELAINE,"Yeah, I know what you were just. It's not helping."
S06E18,JERRY,"Alright, well. Just, start again, then."
S06E18,ELAINE,"Okay, you came to pick me up at..."
S06E18,JERRY,Right.
S06E18,ELAINE,You see? Again.
S06E18,JERRY,What? I said right.
S06E18,ELAINE,"Alright, you came right upstairs, without talking to the doorman."
S06E18,JERRY,But the doorman's gonna say that I was there.
S06E18,ELAINE,(intense) So what? No-one's gonna believe a doorman!
S06E18,JERRY,But I don't know if this is gonna work.
S06E18,ELAINE,"(aggressive, with finger pointing) Just stick with the story. We'll be fine. Let me do the talking!"
S06E18,JERRY,Okay.
S06E18,ELAINE,Good. Now fix me a drink.
S06E18,KRAMER,How's that feel?
S06E18,FRANK,This feels very comfortable.
S06E18,KRAMER,You see?
S06E18,FRANK,I feel ten years younger.
S06E18,KRAMER,"Yeah, and your posture's a lot better. Look at you."
S06E18,FRANK,"And I can breathe easier, too."
S06E18,KRAMER,"I told you! Now, Frank, listen. Here's what I'm thinking. Now, you have a friend in the bra business, right?"
S06E18,FRANK,Of course. Sid Farkus. He's the best in the business.
S06E18,KRAMER,"(claps his hands) Here's our chance. What d'you say? It'll be me, you and the bro, bro."
S06E18,FRANK,Let's do it!
S06E18,FRANK,"Except, we gotta do something about the name."
S06E18,KRAMER,"Why, what's wrong with bro?"
S06E18,FRANK,"No, bro's no good. Too ethnic."
S06E18,KRAMER,"Alright, you got something better?"
S06E18,FRANK,How 'bout uh... the mansiere?
S06E18,KRAMER,Mansiere?
S06E18,FRANK,"That's right. A brassiere for a man. The mansiere, get it?"
S06E18,GEORGE,"(upset) Well, you've scared her off. We may never see mom again."
S06E18,FRANK,"Hey George, what d'you like better? The bro, or the mansiere?"
S06E18,GEORGE,Dad. We need to talk.
S06E18,DOORMAN,"I had to use the bathroom, so I asked this guy to watch the door for a few minutes."
S06E18,MRS. PAYTON,Why should I believe you?
S06E18,DOORMAN,"(indicating Elaine) Actually, it was her friend."
S06E18,MRS. PAYTON,"I was just speaking to the doorman here, about the couch robbery."
S06E18,ELAINE,"Oh really? (skeptical) The doorman. And, pray tell, what did the doorman say?"
S06E18,MRS. PAYTON,He said he asked a friend of yours to watch the door.
S06E18,ELAINE,"(dismissive) Oh, my. Well, the doorman certainly has a wild imagination, doesn't he?"
S06E18,DOORMAN,Well... what do we have here? Perhaps Miss Benes could explain why a Jerry Seinfeld signed for this package (handing the package to Mrs. Payton) at the exact same time the couch was stolen.
S06E18,ELAINE,"(in a rush) He never watched a door before, Mrs Payton, he didn't know how to do it. (pleading) You know, he's a comedian, Mrs Payton, they don't know how to do anything."
S06E18,ELAINE,(desperate) Don't you see what's going on here? He set us up. He's playing all these mindgames.
S06E18,JERRY,You're saying I'm responsible for the couch?
S06E18,ELAINE,(worked up) There was nothing I could do. He said he had a Federal Express slip with your signature on it.
S06E18,JERRY,(livid) Diabolical. He thought of everything. He was setting me up from day one!
S06E18,ELAINE,Is it possible we were victims of a sting?
S06E18,JERRY,I'm sure he's having a good laugh over this with his doorman buddies.
S06E18,DOORMAN 2,"So, you didn't even (indistinct) watch the couch?"
S06E18,DOORMAN,No. I was just messing with his head.
S06E18,DOORMAN 2,And they think they're better than us?
S06E18,ELAINE,"Anyway, Jerry... Jerry?"
S06E18,ELAINE,We have to replace the couch.
S06E18,JERRY,Now we have to buy a new couch?!
S06E18,GEORGE,(crafty) Not necessarily. Why don't you take back the couch you gave me?
S06E18,JERRY,The one with the Poppie stain?!
S06E18,GEORGE,"Yeah, sure. (big smile) Then my father will have no place to sleep. (snaps fingers) He's gotta move out."
S06E18,ELAINE,But it's got a pee-stain on it.
S06E18,GEORGE,"No, the cushion's turned over."
S06E18,ELAINE,(not sure) I guess.
S06E18,GEORGE,(enthusiastic) Yeah. You get a couch. I get rid of my father. It couldn't be more perfect!
S06E18,KRAMER,"Now, it's called the bro."
S06E18,FRANK,"Or, the mansiere."
S06E18,KRAMER,"Yeah, but I prefer the bro."
S06E18,FRANK,I like mansiere.
S06E18,FARKUS,"Well, I have to tell you, it's a very interesting idea."
S06E18,KRAMER,Yeah.
S06E18,FARKUS,"You know, selling bras exclusively to women, we're really only utilising fifty percent of the market."
S06E18,FRANK,"(to Kramer) That's what we figured, huh?"
S06E18,KRAMER,(to Frank) I told you.
S06E18,FARKUS,"And, to be perfectly frank, I've always felt I could use some support. I know, when I'm wearing Banlon, there appears to be some jiggling."
S06E18,FRANK,(vehement) I wouldn't be caught dead in Banlon.
S06E18,FARKUS,"(indicating the bro) So uh, what d'you see in the back? Hooks? Velcro? What?"
S06E18,KRAMER,Uh.
S06E18,FRANK,Definitely velcro.
S06E18,KRAMER,"Say you're getting intimate with a woman uh, you don't want her fumbling and struggling back there."
S06E18,KRAMER,I think we've all experienced that.
S06E18,FARKUS,Summer nights.
S06E18,KRAMER,(pointing at Farkus) Very funny.
S06E18,FARKUS,"Well, I still have to talk about this to Mr. Degrunmont..."
S06E18,KRAMER,"Of course, yes."
S06E18,FARKUS,"...But, barring any unforeseen developments, gentlemen, I think we're sitting on a winner."
S06E18,FARKUS,"(sympathy) Frank, I wanna tell you how sorry I am to hear about you and Estelle separating."
S06E18,FRANK,"Oh, thank you, Sid, but that's all in the past. I'm ready to move on."
S06E18,FARKUS,"(thoughtful) I've always been very fond of Estelle. Beautiful woman. I uh, I hope you don't think uh, this is out of line, but would it be okay with you, if I were to ask her out?"
S06E18,FRANK,(anger) You wanna go out with my wife?! (rage) Where do you get the nerve to ask me something like that?!
S06E18,FARKUS,"Oh, no, Frank, I was just saying..."
S06E18,FRANK,"I know what you're saying, and I know what you're thinking!!"
S06E18,FARKUS,"No, Frank..."
S06E18,FRANK,"C'mon, Cosmo, I'm not doing business with this guy."
S06E18,KRAMER (O.C.),Frank!
S06E18,GEORGE,Jerry took the couch back.
S06E18,FRANK,He took it back? Didn't you tell him I was using it?
S06E18,GEORGE,"Oh, I pleaded with him."
S06E18,FRANK,Where am I supposed to sleep?
S06E18,GEORGE,"Well, I took the liberty of packing your things. (gleeful) Mom's coming to get you."
S06E18,KRAMER,"I thought Jerry didn't want that couch, because of the stain?"
S06E18,FRANK,What stain?
S06E18,KRAMER,"Oh, you didn't notice? It has a pee-stain."
S06E18,FRANK,(disbelief) You had me sleeping on a pee-stained couch?
S06E18,GEORGE,"(light) No. No, no, no. The cushion was turned over."
S06E18,FRANK,"(anger) But, the very idea. you had me lying in urine!!"
S06E18,GEORGE,"Ah! There's mom, there's mom."
S06E18,ESTELLE,Is it safe to come in?
S06E18,GEORGE,"Oh, of course. (motioning Estelle to enter) Of course."
S06E18,ESTELLE,You're not having any of your transvestite parties?
S06E18,FRANK,Will you stop it?
S06E18,ESTELLE,"(to Kramer) I lived with him for forty years, I never saw him trying on my underwear. As soon as he leaves the house, he turns into J. Edgar Hoover!"
S06E18,FRANK,"Here, Cosmo..."
S06E18,KRAMER,"Oh, hey."
S06E18,FRANK,...You can have the hi-fi. (hands it over) I don't need it now...
S06E18,KRAMER,"Awright, I got it."
S06E18,FRANK,...I got one at home.
S06E18,ESTELLE,"Alright, let's go."
S06E18,FRANK,We'll go out for dinner tonight.
S06E18,ESTELLE,"I can't tonight, I'm busy."
S06E18,FRANK,"What d'you mean, busy?"
S06E18,ESTELLE,I'm having dinner with someone.
S06E18,FRANK,With whom?
S06E18,ESTELLE,Sid Farkus.
S06E18,FRANK,(anger) Sid Farkus?! You're not having dinner with a bra salesman.
S06E18,ESTELLE,"Hey, he only sells them. He doesn't wear 'em."
S06E18,FRANK,"Okay, that's it! I'm not coming home!"
S06E18,GEORGE,(upset) But you can't stay here. There's no place to sleep!
S06E18,FRANK,We'll work something out.
S06E18,GERMAN WOMAN,"Stop him! Ja, ja, ja, it's him!"
S06E18,GERMAN WOMAN,Stop that man! It's him.
S06E18,GERMAN WOMAN,"Somebody, stop him! Please, quick. Stop, it's him. I know, I know. Help. Stop him."
S06E18,HORST,"Hey, hey. (pointing) That record player is not yours."
S06E18,KRAMER,"Now, look. Somebody gave it to me."
S06E18,HORST,You're a thief. We have proof.
S06E18,HORST,What is that?
S06E18,KRAMER,"The first upper-body support undergarment, specifically designed for men."
S06E18,HORST,How does it connect in the back? With a hook?
S06E18,KRAMER,"Oh, no, no. (demonstrates) Here, velcro."
S06E18,HORST,"(to the portly German) Ooh, (indistinct German) ...keine problem, ah?"
S06E18,HORST,"Is gut, ja?"
S06E18,MRS. PAYTON,"Well, I suppose it'll have to do."
S06E18,ELAINE,It's a beautiful couch.
S06E18,JERRY,It's hardly been used.
S06E18,JERRY,Poppie!
S06E18,POPPIE,"Oh, hello, Jerry."
S06E18,JERRY,What're you doing here?
S06E18,POPPIE,Visiting my friend.
S06E18,JERRY,"Ohh. Hey, how you feeling?"
S06E18,POPPIE,"Oh, much better, much better. The doctors say I cannot have no aggravation."
S06E18,JERRY,Hmm.
S06E18,POPPIE,"So, I sell the restaurant, uh? I just take it easy. See, if I get excited, 'ats aggravated my condition. The last time I got aggravated, was in the restaurant. With your friend."
S06E18,POPPIE,"She start the big fight, about abortion."
S06E18,POPPIE,It's you! It's you!
S06E18,ELAINE,Wha...?
S06E18,POPPIE,You! I... I gotta sit down!
S06E18,JERRY,"No, Poppie! No!!"
S06E18,FRANK,Kasha?

S06E20,JERRY,..What is this?

S06E20,KRAMER,Flea bites?

S06E20,TEACHER,"Miss Benes , Are you chewing gum?"
S06E20,ELAINE,(nods) HumHummmm....
S06E20,KARL,Yep!...In your bedroom too Mr. Seinfeld. You've got a full outbreak of fleas on your hands.
S06E20,JERRY,I don't get this. How did this happen. I don't have a dog.
S06E20,KARL,I don't explain 'em Mr. Seinfeld. I just exterminate them.
S06E20,JERRY,I don't understand this..
S06E20,KARL,I 'm gonna have to seal the place up for 48 hours and fog it. That's the only way to get rid of them.
S06E20,JERRY,"Nobody can be in here for 48 hours, I got my parents in town."
S06E20,KARL,"Well , unless you want to kill them. They can't stay in here. This stuff is pretty toxic. I'll go get my stuff, it's in the truck."
S06E20,JERRY,Okay..
S06E20,ELAINE,Hi....???
S06E20,JERY,Bug guy.
S06E20,ELAINE,Why do you have a bug guy?
S06E20,JERRY,I have fleas.
S06E20,ELAINE,Argh.. Fleas ( strikes the purse she just deposited on the couch) How did you get fleas?
S06E20,JERRY,I don't know...But every one's got to clear out of the apartment for two days. I don't know what I'm gonna do with my parents. they'll never let me pay for a hotel and if they go to someplace on their own I'm sure it's gonna be some awful dump. Wait a second.. Have you checked in The Plaza yet?
S06E20,ELAINE,No....Oh No....
S06E20,JERRY,"Come on,c'mon"
S06E20,ELAINE,"No, No..."
S06E20,JERRY,"c'mon ,c'mon...."

S06E20,GEORGE,yeah!
S06E20,ELAINE,Well what about you. Where you gonna stay?
S06E20,JERRY,"I dunno , I'm gonna ask Shelley ,but she still might be upset from the masticated pecan incident."
S06E20,ELAINE,Hey!! I found out from Paula; She likes George. I'll bet he'll be relieved.
S06E20,JERRY,Yeah.. When he's dead he'll be relieved... Oh by the way Viking Press sent a Fedex for you to my parents. They brought it with 'em.
S06E20,ELAINE,Yeah that's just some stuff about the company.
S06E20,GEORGE,Hum..( to Elaine) Hey! did you talk to Paula?
S06E20,ELAINE,Yeah.
S06E20,GEORGE,So what did she say?
S06E20,ELAINE,She...likes you..
S06E20,GEORGE,She said she liked me. No kiddin' she said that?
S06E20,ELAINE,Ya!
S06E20,GEORGE,"Those were her exact words, I like George."
S06E20,ELAINE,Yep!
S06E20,GEORGE,"Ha Haaaaaaa... Jerry how do you like that.You see I get myself in a dizzy, I'm all worked up and for what?"
S06E20,ELAINE,For nothing..
S06E20,GEORGE,ha Ha..
S06E20,ELAINE,In fact she said that looks aren't even that important to her...
S06E20,GEORGE,You see.....WHAT!!
S06E20,ELAINE,Ah Oh!!
S06E20,GEORGE,She said looks aren't important to her?
S06E20,ELAINE,"Well..hum...let me rephrase that, She said...."
S06E20,GEORGE,She thinks I'm ugly. I knew it.
S06E20,JERRY,"You see the thing of it is, there's a lot of ugly people out there walking around, but they don't know they're ugly, because nobody actually tells them."
S06E20,GEORGE,.....So what's your point?
S06E20,JERRY,I dunno...
S06E20,ELAINE,"Okay.. The point , George, is she likes you."
S06E20,GEORGE,"Oh!, so what. I'd rather she hate me and thought I was good looking....At least I can get somebody else. (scratching his chest) What is this? Why am I itching?"
S06E20,JERRY,That'd be the fleas.
S06E20,JERRY,Hey!!!
S06E20,MORTY,"Hey! I do you like this? Huh, huh!"
S06E20,HELEN,"Oh! my god, Morty lets go, this is too nice."
S06E20,MORTY,"Hey! This is the kind of room Sinatra stays in. Hey! look , Macadamian nuts."
S06E20,HELEN,Macadamian nuts?
S06E20,MORTY,"Hey! You know what these cost, they're like 80 cents a nut."
S06E20,HELEN,"Jerry, are you sure this all right?"
S06E20,JERRY,Yeah! it's all taken care of.
S06E20,MORTY,( from the other room) Hey!!! They got a phone in the john here.
S06E20,ELAINE,Judy .
S06E20,JUDY,Hey!!!!.
S06E20,ELAINE,"Hi, Thank you so much for recommending me to Viking Press ."
S06E20,JUDY,"It is my pleasure , just make sure you give that manuscript a good read."
S06E20,ELAINE,Manuscript?
S06E20,JUDY,Yeah. I'm sure they Fedexed you a manuscript. They want to see that you can read an unpublished work and give insightful criticism.
S06E20,ELAINE,Oooh!!
S06E20,JUDY,Read it twice if you have to. This is a big step in your career.
S06E20,ELAINE,Yeah! hmmm..I gotta go..
S06E20,JUDY,Hey! What about lunch?
S06E20,ELAINE,(she leaves hurriedly) I gotta gooo...
S06E20,ELAINE,Thank god I found you..
S06E20,JERRY,Oh! Hey!

S06E20,JERRY,"Yeah! I got it . It's in the apartment, but we can't go in there it's being fumigated."
S06E20,ELAINE,No I'll take my chances. Come on...( Grabs him by the coat and head back to his place)
S06E20,JERRY,You see?
S06E20,ELAINE,"Jerry , I need that Fedex right now.."
S06E20,JERRY,I told you to take it.
S06E20,ELAINE,"Well, I didn't know that it was a manuscript that I had to read..."
S06E20,JERRY,"Well, You can't go in there it's like a gas chamber in there."
S06E20,KRAMER,I left a Macanaw peach in your refrigerator.
S06E20,JERRY,"Kramer, they're fumigating. There's toxic gas in there."
S06E20,KRAMER,Toxic gas!!!
S06E20,JERRY,"Aw! You'll be fine, you were in there for what , a couple of minutes."
S06E20,KRAMER,"An hour and a half!!! I was reading a manuscript, I just couldn't put it down."
S06E20,ELAINE,My manuscript?
S06E20,JERRY,How do you feel?
S06E20,KRAMER,"Now that you mention it , a little woozy."
S06E20,ELAINE,Kramer You got go back in there grab my manuscript.
S06E20,KRAMER,I'm not going back in there!!
S06E20,ELAINE,"all right then, where is it??"
S06E20,KRAMER,I left it on the coffee table or somethin'
S06E20,JERRY,Well wh..wh.what are you doing?
S06E20,ELAINE,I'm going in .
S06E20,JERRY,Didn't you see the sign on the door?
S06E20,KRAMER,Well I thought it was so your parents wouldn't walk in while you're with a girl.
S06E20,ELAINE,"( Heavy Panting) It's not on any table, Kramer. Where is it?"
S06E20,KRAMER,"Well I don't know . I was in the bathroom , the kitchen..."
S06E20,ELAINE,Okay... bathroom....kitchen.
S06E20,JERRY,Can you get me a soda?
S06E20,KRAMER,"Jerry, I had some milk, I made a sandwich. I got to get out of the building."
S06E20,ELAINE,(again pants) I couldn't find it anywhere. How did you get fleas anyway?
S06E20,JERRY,I don't know. Who could've been in my apartment.
S06E20,ELAINE,"I 've looked everywhere , even under the couch but all I could find were the stupid Chunky wrappers. I couldn't...."
S06E20,JERRY,Wait a minute . Did you say chunky wrappers?
S06E20,ELAINE,Yeah!
S06E20,JERRY,Let me see those. ( smells them) Oh! I know the chunky that left these Chunkies......NEWMAN!!! I've got him.
S06E20,JERRY,"Newman . Open the door, Newman, I know you're in there."
S06E20,NEWMAN,Hello jerry. What a pleasant surprise.
S06E20,JERRY,"There's nothing pleasant about it, so lets just cut the crap.. You gave me fleas. I know it and you know it.."
S06E20,NEWMAN,"Fleas? Bwa ha ha ha ha .That's preposterous. How can I , give you fleas. Now if you don't mind..."
S06E20,JERRY,Oh! but I do. There's probably fleas crawling all over your little snack bar. ( as he says this Newman is wildly scratching behind his back. he suddenly stops when Jerry turns around)
S06E20,NEWMAN,"So , you have fleas. Maybe you keep your house in a state of disrepair. Maybe you live in squalor."
S06E20,JERRY,"You know Newman , the thing about fleas is that they irritate the skin and they start to...itch. Oh! maybe you can hold out five seconds or ten, maybe fifteen or twenty but after a while, no matter how much will power a person may have. It won't matter, because they're crawling , crawling on your skin. Up your legs , up your spine , up your back....."
S06E20,NEWMAN,(Cannot take this torture anymore) Baaaaaaaaarrhhhhhhhhhhh....I'm ripped with fleas ( scratches furiously)
S06E20,MORTY,Oh! Oh! That feels good. Hey! This guy charges a hundred bucks an hour but I'm telling ya he's worth every penny OOOOHH!
S06E20,HELEN,I'm next.
S06E20,MORTY,"Hey! Leo, get this, four movies at once; Pay Per View."
S06E20,LEO,I love these nuts.
S06E20,NANA,This Champagne's gone flat. ( throws her glass over her shoulder)
S06E20,HELEN,Nana!!!
S06E20,NANA,He Ha Ha Ha...Let the chambermaid clean it up
S06E20,GEORGE,Hello..
S06E20,PAULA,What's the matter?...
S06E20,GEORGE,Well I spoke to Elaine...
S06E20,PAULA,"Hey! Look , no shave."
S06E20,GEORGE,No...Why should that make any difference to you?
S06E20,PAULA,It doesn't..
S06E20,GEORGE,Of course not. You don't care what I look like.
S06E20,PAULA,That's right I don't.
S06E20,GEORGE,I suppose I could just pull this out ( his tucked shirt)and walk around like this and you wouldn't care?
S06E20,PAULA,Not a wit.
S06E20,GEORGE,Hu humm? i suppose we could go to Lincoln Center and I'd be wearing sneakers and jeans and that would be fine too.
S06E20,PAULA,You can wear sweatpants.
S06E20,GEORGE,I could..
S06E20,PAULA,"(seductively) You could drape yourself in velvet, for all I care."
S06E20,GEORGE,Velvet...
S06E20,ELAINE,Did you read the whole thing?
S06E20,KRAMER,Oh! yeah.
S06E20,ELAINE,Huh . So What's it about?
S06E20,KRAMER,"Well it's a story about love, deception, greed, lust and...unbridled enthusiasm."
S06E20,ELAINE,unbridled enthusiasm...?
S06E20,KRAMER,"Well , that's what led to Billy Mumphrey's downfall."
S06E20,ELAINE,Oh! boy.
S06E20,KRAMER,"You see Elaine, Billy was a simple country boy. You might say a cockeyed optimist, who got himself mixed up in the high stakes game of world diplomacy and international intrigue."
S06E20,ELAINE,Oh! my God.
S06E20,KRAMER,ah! Here we go.
S06E20,ELAINE,(to the waitress) can I have a scotch on the rocks.
S06E20,KRAMER,May I..( pointing her food)
S06E20,ELAINE,(feeling sick) Yeah! go ahead.
S06E20,KRAMER,what is this?
S06E20,ELAINE,What? What are you doin'? ( Kramer salting her food)
S06E20,KRAMER,I can't taste this.
S06E20,ELAINE,What are you talking about?
S06E20,KRAMER,"This food ,it has no taste......nothin' I'm gettin' nothin'...( realizes) It must be the toxic gas from the fumigation......( he leaves paranoid and confused)"
S06E20,JERRY,"Hey, thanks a lot for lettin' me stay here."
S06E20,SHELLY,"Well, I don't keep pecans in the house so I didn't think it'd be a problem."
S06E20,JERRY,( embarrassed laugh) ...Oh! Damn..
S06E20,SHELLY,What's the matter?
S06E20,JERRY,I forgot my toothbrush.
S06E20,SHELLY,Oh! no problem.....You can use mine.
S06E20,JERRY,Yours?....You know what I'll think I'll brush later.
S06E20,SHELLY,Brush now.
S06E20,JERRY,(long pause).......Sure. ( humms a song then stares at the toothbrush)
S06E20,KRAMER,"Newman ,Let me have a bite of your Macanaw.."
S06E20,NEWMAN,"What for, you got your own."
S06E20,KRAMER,"Come on ,c'mon i need to taste it. ( takes his peach).....Nothin' , Can't even taste a Macanaw."
S06E20,NEWMAN,( resumes eating) Well that's a shame.
S06E20,KRAMER,Waited all year and I can't even taste it..
S06E20,NEWMAN,You can't taste 'em . Why waste 'em . Why not give them all to me.
S06E20,ELAINE,"It's a story about love , deception ,greed , lust and.... unbridled enthusiasm ."
S06E20,MANDEL,Unbridled enthusiasm.
S06E20,ELAINE,Yeah!..tha..that's right. that That's what led to...(throath clearing) Billy Mumphrey's downfall.
S06E20,MANDEL,"hmmm...interesting take. So you believe, has he not been so enthusiastic he could have adverted disaster."
S06E20,ELAINE,"Yes...Ye..Yes..That's right...You see ,Billy Mumphrey was a simple country boy. Some might say a cockeyed optimist, who got caught up in the dirty game of world diplomacy and International intrigue."
S06E20,MANDEL,So.. It was more a question of attitude than politics..
S06E20,ELAINE,"Yes, yes Mr. Mandel."
S06E20,MORTY,Hey! Under Siege is on again. Whose up for it?
S06E20,LEO,No more nuts. Awrghh.....
S06E20,JERRY,Oh! my god. What the hell is this? ..... Don't tell me.......Velvet!!!
S06E20,GEORGE,It's the real deal.
S06E20,JERRY,She's seen you in this thing.
S06E20,GEORGE,That's right...We just had sex......You know Jerry I've been searching for someone a long time. Well the search is over.
S06E20,JERRY,And now the search for the right psychiatrist begins.
S06E20,GEORGE,He he...So huh! What's with the suitcase.
S06E20,JERRY,Ahh! She threw me out.
S06E20,GEORGE,Why?
S06E20,JERRY,I wouldn't use her toothbrush.
S06E20,GEORGE,So where are you staying?
S06E20,JERRY,Well I guess I'm stuck with the Velvet Fog.
S06E20,MANDEL,"Three hours of massage time , twelve in-room movies including several adult features, five shoe shines and four hundred dolars worth of snacks. Not to mention the damage to the room."
S06E20,ELAINE,"Mr Mandel, you don't understand ...my my friend had fleas. I ran into the gas, it could have killed me, and my, my other friend couldn't taste his peaches ,they only good for two weeks."
S06E20,MANDEL,"I think , you've read, one too many, Billy Mumphrey stories. Good day Miss Benes."
S06E20,ELAINE,Okay...Good day..
S06E20,PAULA,Hi George.
S06E20,GEORGE,"( mouth full) Hi, this is fantastic ( puts the pit in the a plate)D'you ever had a Macanaw peach?"
S06E20,PAULA,Oh! yeah I love those.
S06E20,GEORGE,"Too bad , it's all done."
S06E20,KRAMER,ya....Yes!....Yes! it's back I can taste again. ( to a passerby) Hey! What's the date today?
S06E20,PASSERBY,The fifteenth.
S06E20,KRAMER,"Fifteenth , Yes last day for the Macanaws. I can still make it. Wait.. Newman..."
S06E20,NEWMAN,"Sorry , last one . Would you want to suck the pit?"
S06E20,KRAMER,( fake laugh ) Look Hubert. It's the mailman. You remember the mailman don't you.
S06E20,ELAINE,( knocks) Hello is anybody here?..
S06E20,LEO,They said they were sending an Asian woman.
S06E20,ELAINE,Oh! my God.
S06E21,[Opening Scene,"Jerry and Elaine are outside, heading towards the apartment building]"
S06E21,JERRY,I hear you're going out with David Putty.
S06E21,ELAINE,"Yeah. What, is it a problem?"
S06E21,JERRY,"Well, I think he could've asked me. Supposed to be a friend of mine."
S06E21,ELAINE,"Well, I guess he figured you just wouldn't care. It *has* been a few years."
S06E21,JERRY,"Elaine, you always care who an ex-girlfriend dates. You don't want it to be someone you know, and you don't want it to be someone better than you. Now, even though the latter is *obviously* impossible."
S06E21,ELAINE,"Oh, god."
S06E21,JERRY,"The former still applies. I don't know what it is, but I just can't see you with a mechanic."
S06E21,ELAINE,"Oh, yeah. Right, right. Well, all those mechanics do is work all day with their hands and their *big*, *muscular* arms on machines, and then they come home dripping with animal sexuality like Stanley Kowalski. What a huge turn-off that is."
S06E21,JERRY,All right.
S06E21,GEORGE,"Look at that. They got lobster on the menu. Who would order a lobster here. I mean, do they bring a lobster in everyday hoping *todays* the day."
S06E21,ESTELLE,So what if they have a lobster. Suddenly you're a shell-fish connoisseur.
S06E21,GEORGE,"You know, I think we really need to be in front of a television set. You take T.V. out of this relationship, it is *just* torture."
S06E21,ESTELLE,"So, I'm getting an eye job."
S06E21,GEORGE,"An eye job? Ma, you don't need an eye job."
S06E21,ESTELLE,"Georgie, I'm a divorcee."
S06E21,GEORGE,"No, you're not a divorcee. Youre just separated. You're---you're a separatee."
S06E21,ESTELLE,"Well, I'm out there, George."
S06E21,GEORGE,"No, you're not out there."
S06E21,ESTELLE,"I am, too!"
S06E21,GEORGE,"You're not out there! You can't be, because *I* am out there. And if I see *you* out there, there's not enough voltage in this world to electroshock me back into coherence!"
S06E21,ESTELLE,"Well, anyway, the operation is on Tuesday and I need you to drive me home because I'll be all drugged up."
S06E21,GEORGE,Tuesday? I can't do it Tuesday. Steinbrenner needs me to run---
S06E21,ESTELLE,This is the only time the doctor *has*.
S06E21,GEORGE,"Kramer, hey, hey! (Gets up out of his seat)"
S06E21,KRAMER,"Hi, little buddy."
S06E21,GEORGE,Come on over and sit down.
S06E21,KRAMER,"Hey, listen, I gotta go somewhere."
S06E21,GEORGE,"No, you're gonna sit down, you son of a gun..."
S06E21,KRAMER,"All right, I'm sitting down. How are you? (Kisses Estelle on the cheek)"
S06E21,ESTELLE,"So, Kramer. I'm getting an eye job."
S06E21,KRAMER,"Oh, yeah, good for you. Hey, you have to look your best. You're out there now."
S06E21,GEORGE,She's not out there!
S06E21,KRAMER,"So, who is your doctor?"
S06E21,ESTELLE,"Uh, Bakersoll."
S06E21,KRAMER,(whistles). He's good. He's *very* good. He worked on this kid from Guatemala with no nose. Turned him into Ricardo Montalban.
S06E21,GEORGE,"Hey, Kramer, what are you doing Tuesday?"
S06E21,KRAMER,Tuesday? Uh...
S06E21,GEORGE,Why doesn't *he* pick you up after the operation. He's got the car with the bench seats that you like.
S06E21,ESTELLE,"Oh, I don't care."
S06E21,KRAMER,"Yeah, I know, but I can't drive anybody anywhere until I go down to the motor vehicle bureau and get my new plates."
S06E21,GEORGE,"Well, giddy-up!"
S06E21,KRAMER,"Yeah, I'm here to pick up my new plates. My name is Kramer. Cosmo Kramer."
S06E21,CLERK,Kramer.... (checks computer) All right...
S06E21,KRAMER,All righty...
S06E21,CLERK,"Sign right here, please. (hands over clipboard)"
S06E21,KRAMER,"(signs it) Okay. (The clerk hands him a manila envelope). Thanks. (opens up the envelope) Assman? Oh, no, these don't belong to me. I'm not the Assman. I think there's been a mistake."
S06E21,CLERK,What's your name again?
S06E21,KRAMER,Cosmo Kramer.
S06E21,CLERK,(checks computer again) Cosmo Kramer. You *are* the Assman.
S06E21,KRAMER,No! I'm not the Assman.
S06E21,CLERK,"Well, as far as the state of New York is concerned, you are."
S06E21,DAVID,How do you feel?
S06E21,ELAINE,Fine.
S06E21,DAVID,Something the matter?
S06E21,ELAINE,No.
S06E21,DAVID,Then what is it?
S06E21,ELAINE,"No, nothing."
S06E21,JERRY,Hi.
S06E21,ELAINE,I was with David *Putty* last night.
S06E21,JERRY,"Yeah, so."
S06E21,ELAINE,He did the move.
S06E21,JERRY,What move?
S06E21,ELAINE,You know...*the* move.
S06E21,JERRY,Wait a second. *My* move?
S06E21,JERRY,David Putty used *my* move?
S06E21,ELAINE,"Yes, yes."
S06E21,JERRY,Are you sure?
S06E21,ELAINE,Jerry! There is no confusing *that* move with any other move.
S06E21,JERRY,I can't believe it. He *stole* my move.
S06E21,ELAINE,What else did you tell (reaches over to slap Jerry) him. (does it again) The two of you must have had *quite* a little chat!
S06E21,JERRY,"Oh, it wasn't like that! I didn't even mention you. You know, we were in the garage. You know how garages are. They're conducive to sex talk. It's a high-testosterone area."
S06E21,ELAINE,Because of all the pistons and the lube jobs?
S06E21,JERRY,"Well, I'm going down to that garage and telling him to stop doing it."
S06E21,ELAINE,"Well, wait---wait a second."
S06E21,JERRY,What?
S06E21,ELAINE,Isn't that a little...rash?
S06E21,JERRY,No! He stole my move!
S06E21,ELAINE,"Yeah, but...*I* like the move."
S06E21,JERRY,"Yeah, but it's like another comedian stealing my material."
S06E21,ELAINE,"Well, he doesn't even do it exactly the same. He--he--he uses a pinch at the end instead of the *swirl*!"
S06E21,JERRY,"Oh, yeah. The pinch. *I've* done the pinch. That's not new. Besides which, I don't know how you could trust any of his moves now. His whole *repertoire* could be lifted."
S06E21,ELAINE,"You know, it's strange, because he's such an honest mechanic."
S06E21,JERRY,"I know, he's probably the only honest mechanic in New York."
S06E21,JERRY,...so he stole my move and he's using it on Elaine.
S06E21,GEORGE,"You told David Putty your move and you didn't tell *me*? I *need* a move. You know I have no moves, Jerry. (points to the candy bar) Gimme a bite."
S06E21,JERRY,Can I just get it opened first?
S06E21,GEORGE,I can't believe you're hoarding sex moves. I'm out there rubbing two sticks together. You walk around with a zippo.
S06E21,JERRY,"All right, all right. Here. (hands George a piece of the candy bar)."
S06E21,GEORGE,"(takes a bite) Oh, that's good. That's very good."
S06E21,JERRY,You feel better?
S06E21,GEORGE,"Yeah, much better. All right, so what's the move, because I need *something*. This woman I'm dating, it's like she's doing her nails during love-making."
S06E21,JERRY,Nancy Klopper?
S06E21,GEORGE,"Yeah. Never seen anyone so bored. I'm working like a dog here. Give me a moan. *Something*. I'd settle for a belch, for god's sake. All right, come on, let's have it."
S06E21,JERRY,"All right, George. I'm gonna tell you. But I just wanna make sure, before---"
S06E21,GEORGE,"Yeah, yeah, yeah. It's in the vault. I'm putting it in the vault."
S06E21,JERRY,"It's not even a question of that. The point is when something like this is passed along, one must be certain that it's going to be used in a *conscientious* way. This is not some parlor trick to be used---"
S06E21,GEORGE,You're gonna tell me...or not.
S06E21,JERRY,All right. On your bed. You got a headboard? You'll need a headboard.
S06E21,GEORGE,I got a headboard.
S06E21,JERRY,Is it padded?
S06E21,GEORGE,No.
S06E21,JERRY,Good. How tall is she?
S06E21,GEORGE,Five-foot four. Why?
S06E21,JERRY,"You can't have more than a one-foot differential in your heights. Otherwise, you could really hurt your neck."
S06E21,GEORGE,I can't tell ya how much I appreciate this.
S06E21,JERRY,"George, if you could master this, you'll never be alone again."
S06E21,[Back at Jerry's apartment,"Jerry and George have just walked in, still conversing on the same subject]"
S06E21,JERRY,"Now, the ending is kind of an option. I use the swirl. I like the swirl. I'm comfortable with the swirl. *I* feel the swirl is a great capper. He uses the pinch, which I find a little presumptuous."
S06E21,GEORGE,Is it a clockwise swirl?
S06E21,JERRY,"I prefer clockwise, but it's not written in stone."
S06E21,KRAMER,"Here you go, buddy. (shows it to Jerry)."
S06E21,JERRY,What is it?
S06E21,KRAMER,*Fusilli* Jerry! It's made from Fusilli pasta. See the microphone?
S06E21,JERRY,When did you do this?
S06E21,KRAMER,"In my spare time. (turns to George). You know, I'm working on one of you, George. I'm using ravioli. See, the hard part is to find a pasta that captures the individual."
S06E21,JERRY,Oh... Why Fusilli?
S06E21,KRAMER,Because *you're* silly. Get it? (hands the Fusilli to Jerry) Yeah...
S06E21,JERRY,"Well, thank you very much."
S06E21,GEORGE,"So, did you get your new plates?"
S06E21,KRAMER,Oh...yeah. I got my new plates. But they mixed them up. Somebody got mine and I got their *vanity* plates.
S06E21,GEORGE,What do they say?
S06E21,KRAMER,Assman.
S06E21,JERRY,Assman?
S06E21,KRAMER,"Yeah. Assman, Jerry. I'm Cosmo Kramer, the Assman!"
S06E21,JERRY,"Who would order a license plate that says ""Assman""?"
S06E21,GEORGE,Maybe they're Wilt Chamberlain's.
S06E21,JERRY,It doesn't have to be someone who gets a lot of women. It could be just some guy with a big ass.
S06E21,KRAMER,"Yeah, or it could be a proctologist."
S06E21,JERRY,Yeah. Proctologist.
S06E21,GEORGE,Come on! No doctor would put that on his car.
S06E21,KRAMER,"Have you ever *met* a proctologist? Well, they usually have a very good sense of humor. You meet a proctologist at a party, don't walk away. *Plant* yourself there, because you will hear the funniest stories you've ever heard. See, no one wants to admit to them that they *stuck* something up there. Never! It's always an accident. Every proctologist story ends in the same way ""It was a million to one shot, Doc. Million to one."""
S06E21,KRAMER,Oh! There's my phone. (He leaves)
S06E21,GEORGE,"So, where you gonna stick this (points to the Fusilli Jerry)"
S06E21,JERRY,I'll tell you where I'd like to stick it.
S06E21,JERRY,"Hey, David."
S06E21,DAVID,"Oh, hi, Jerry."
S06E21,JERRY,"Hey, what's the story? I hear you're doing my move."
S06E21,DAVID,What move?
S06E21,JERRY,What move? *My* move. The one I told you about. You used it on Elaine.
S06E21,DAVID,"You're move? What, are you kidding? I was doing that before I knew you. All you told me about was the ending."
S06E21,JERRY,"The ending is the whole thing. Without the ending, it's nothing. You had *nothing*."
S06E21,DAVID,"Oh, that ending was *so* obvious. I would have figured it out anyway. I didn't need you to tell me that stupid twist."
S06E21,JERRY,Swirl.
S06E21,DAVID,Whatever. I don't even do it.
S06E21,JERRY,"Oh, yeah, I know. You do the *pinch*."
S06E21,DAVID,"Yeah, that's right."
S06E21,JERRY,"You can't come up with your own stuff , so you *steal* other peoples? You're nothing but a hack."
S06E21,DAVID,"Are you through, 'cuz, uh, I gotta get back to work."
S06E21,JERRY,"Well, I'll tell you what I'll do, you know. If you wanna do it out of town...okay. But not in the city."
S06E21,DAVID,"All right, how about the next time your car breaks down, you take *that* out of town."
S06E21,JERRY,Fine.
S06E21,DAVID,Good!
S06E21,NANCY,"Ow, George! (crawls out from beneath the covers) What are you doing?"
S06E21,GEORGE,"(pops his head out of the covers, looking a bit confused) Uh...you know, uh...pleasuring you."
S06E21,NANCY,"Well, stop it!"
S06E21,GEORGE,You don't like the move?
S06E21,NANCY,No. I don't.
S06E21,GEORGE,You're kidding.
S06E21,NANCY,"No, I'm not. It feels like aliens poking at my body."
S06E21,GEORGE,Sorry. I'll just go back to my usual routine.
S06E21,ELAINE,"Oh, god! Oh, god, Dave! Oh, yes! Yes!"
S06E21,DAVID,"No, I'm sorry."
S06E21,ELAINE,What?!!
S06E21,DAVID,I can't do the move.
S06E21,ELAINE,What?
S06E21,DAVID,"Oh, he's ruined it for me."
S06E21,ELAINE,"Oh, oh, come on, please?"
S06E21,DAVID,"No, he called me a hack. I'm just not into doing it anymore."
S06E21,ELAINE,"Oh, so---so that's it?"
S06E21,DAVID,I'll come up with some new stuff.
S06E21,KRAMER,"""Call me. Thirty-six, twenty-four, forty-six. I think I have what you're looking for."" (Pleased by the note, Kramer stumbles into his car)."
S06E21,DR. BAKERSOLL,I must caution you about one thing. You can't cry for at least ten day. You can ruin the operation.
S06E21,ESTELLE,"Oh, okay."
S06E21,DR. BAKERSOLL,"Now, is someone coming to pick you up?"
S06E21,ESTELLE,"Yes, my son's friend should be here any minute."
S06E21,SECURITY GUARD,Can I help you?
S06E21,KRAMER,"Ah, yeah. Doctor Cosmo Kramer. (points to plate) Proctology."
S06E21,SECURITY GUARD,"Oh, oh, okay. Sure..."
S06E21,KRAMER,Thanks. Have a good day.
S06E21,KRAMER,I just can't get over how fantastic you look.
S06E21,ESTELLE,"Oh, really?"
S06E21,KRAMER,"Oh, yeah. This takes twenty years off."
S06E21,ESTELLE,And it was all done by laser. I don't even need bandages.
S06E21,ESTELLE,"Did he say ""Assman""?"
S06E21,KRAMER,"Oh, yeah."
S06E21,ESTELLE,Oh my goodness.
S06E21,(Another car passes,"""Hey, the Assman's in town!"")"
S06E21,KRAMER,You got that straight!
S06E21,ESTELLE,Boy. I never dreamed it could make such a difference.
S06E21,JERRY,You must have done *something* wrong. You probably screwed up the order. Did you close with the swirl?
S06E21,GEORGE,Supposed to close with the swirl?
S06E21,JERRY,"Oh my god. Yes, you close with the swirl. There's a progression there. I told you to write it down."
S06E21,GEORGE,"Yeah, yeah, should've written it down."
S06E21,JERRY,Yeah?
S06E21,BUZZER,Elaine.
S06E21,JERRY,C'mon up. (turns to George) You know what? Do me a favor. Don't even do the move anymore. You're gonna give it a bad name.
S06E21,JERRY,"Hello? Yeah, this is Jerry Seinfeld. What? Twenty-eight hundred dollars?!! That's the estimate on my car?!! No, don't even do anything. I'm gonna think about it. Okay, bye."
S06E21,GEORGE,"What's to think about? If Putty says it's what it is, it's what it is. He's not gonna cheat you."
S06E21,JERRY,Except that it's not Putty.
S06E21,GEORGE,What happened to Putty?
S06E21,JERRY,"Eh, we had a little fight about the move. I took her to this other place. I think they might be trying to screw me."
S06E21,GEORGE,"Well, of course they're trying to screw you. What do you think? That's what they do. They can make up anything. Nobody knows. ""By the way, you need a new Johnson rod in there."" ""Oh, a Johnson rod. Yeah, well, you better put one of those on."""
S06E21,JERRY,"Hey, Elaine."
S06E21,ELAINE,"Yeah, yeah, hello."
S06E21,JERRY,Is it something I said?
S06E21,ELAINE,Yes! As a matter of fact! David Putty won't do the move anymore.
S06E21,JERRY,Really?
S06E21,ELAINE,"Oh, he's come up with some other move. You should see this thing."
S06E21,JERRY,What is it?
S06E21,ELAINE,"Oh, it's a lot of just fancy-shmancy stuff. You know what it's like? It's like a big budget movie with a story that goes *nowhere*."
S06E21,JERRY,Huh.
S06E21,ELAINE,"I mean, this move is no good, Jerry. It's just taking up a lot of my time. And I...will not stand by and allow him to perform this move on me, when a perfectly good move is just sitting in the barn doing nothing!"
S06E21,GEORGE,Let me ask you a question. This new move. Is there a knuckle involved in any way?
S06E21,ELAINE,"Yes. As a matter of fact, there is."
S06E21,GEORGE,I think that's mine.
S06E21,ELAINE,I'm not surprised.
S06E21,JERRY,Listen. I need you to do me a favor. When's the next time you're gonna see him?
S06E21,ELAINE,Why?
S06E21,JERRY,You gotta get an estimate on my car from him. I think this garage is trying to screw me.
S06E21,ELAINE,An estimate? How am I supposed to do that?
S06E21,JERRY,"Well, look. Here's the work order with everything that broke. Just kind of bring it up at the right time and find out. (hands Elaine the work order)"
S06E21,ELAINE,(takes the work order and points to the Fusilli Jerry sitting on the table) What? What is this?
S06E21,JERRY,"That's, uh, Fusilli Jerry."
S06E21,ELAINE,Fusilli Jerry?
S06E21,JERRY,Yeah. Kramer made it.
S06E21,GEORGE,"All right, listen, I'll see you guys later."
S06E21,JERRY,"Hey, Assman!"
S06E21,KRAMER,"Hey, well, this is Sally."
S06E21,SALLY,Hello.
S06E21,JERRY,Hi.
S06E21,ELAINE,Hi.
S06E21,KRAMER,Shall we go?
S06E21,SALLY,Okay. (turns around and walks out with an exaggerated swing of her hips)
S06E21,ESTELLE,You can't face the fact that I'm improving myself.
S06E21,FRANK,You're not the only one improving yourself. I worked out with a dumbbell yesterday. I feel *vigorous*.
S06E21,ESTELLE,Just take your mail and go home. I have things to do.
S06E21,FRANK,"I got things to do, too."
S06E21,ESTELLE,Don't upset me! I can't cry!
S06E21,FRANK,"Getting an eye job like some Manhattanite, huh?"
S06E21,ESTELLE,"Well, it's already working. Kramer made a pass at me."
S06E21,FRANK,Kramer made a pass at you? You're crazy.
S06E21,ESTELLE,I'm not crazy. He stopped short and made a grab.
S06E21,FRANK,He stopped short? That's my move. I'm gonna kill him!
S06E21,ELAINE,"Hey, let me ask you a question."
S06E21,DAVID,Sure.
S06E21,ELAINE,What do you charge for blown shocks?
S06E21,DAVID,What?
S06E21,ELAINE,"Two, three hundred?"
S06E21,DAVID,I don't know. Maybe five hundred.
S06E21,ELAINE,Ah.
S06E21,ELAINE,What about a bad gasket?
S06E21,DAVID,Bad gasket?
S06E21,ELAINE,Yeah. Like a terrible gasket.
S06E21,DAVID,What is all this?
S06E21,ELAINE,"Nothing, nothing. I'm just taking an interest in what you...do."
S06E21,DAVID,What kind of car is it?
S06E21,ELAINE,Oh...any kind of---of a Swedish car.
S06E21,DAVID,"All together, that could run about sixteen hundred."
S06E21,ELAINE,Oh.
S06E21,ELAINE,Is that with the parts and labor?
S06E21,DAVID,Uh-huh.
S06E21,ELAINE,Hmm.
S06E21,ELAINE,"Oh, no. No, David. No, please. Not the knuckle...."
S06E21,NANCY,Wow. That was...*great*. I mean...*wow*.
S06E21,GEORGE,It just came to me.
S06E21,NANCY,I---I've never in my life have---have I---. What was that?
S06E21,GEORGE,You mean in the end?
S06E21,NANCY,Uh-huh.
S06E21,GEORGE,A counter-clockwise swirl.
S06E21,NANCY,What's that?
S06E21,GEORGE,What?
S06E21,NANCY,On---on your hand? Let me see what's on your hand.
S06E21,GEORGE,Nothing. I don't know...just a little dirt.
S06E21,NANCY,Give me that. (grabs his hand) I wanna see what's on your hand.
S06E21,NANCY,"Number one. Take her leg.... Oh, my god! Crib notes? You've got crib notes?!!"
S06E21,GEORGE,It's a very complicated move! I couldn't remember it all.
S06E21,NANCY,"Oh, my god, you're sick. (gets out of bed)"
S06E21,GEORGE,"You know, it's not the S.A.T.s!"
S06E21,FRANK,"Assman? I'll get him, Assman!"
S06E21,JERRY,"Sixteen hundred dollars? That's all? *Ooh*, they are ripping me off."
S06E21,ELAINE,So what are you going to do?
S06E21,JERRY,"Well, that's it. I'm going back to Putty. No move is worth this."
S06E21,ELAINE,Oh! You mean you don't care if he does the move anymore?
S06E21,JERRY,Are you kidding? He can do every move I've ever done! Do you know what a good mechanic is worth? You can't compare that to sex.
S06E21,JERRY,"Hi, Mr. Constanza. What's uh...?"
S06E21,FRANK,Where's your friend Kramer?
S06E21,JERRY,I don't know. Why?
S06E21,FRANK,Because I'm looking for him. That's why. He stopped short.
S06E21,JERRY,What do you mean?
S06E21,FRANK,"In a car, with my wife. He stopped short. You think I don't know what that's about? That's my old move! I used it on Estelle forty years ago! I told everybody about it! Everybody knows! (Demonstrates) Hmmph! I stopped short."
S06E21,JERRY,"Really, stopping short. That's a good move."
S06E21,FRANK,You're not kidding it's a good move!
S06E21,KRAMER,Hey.
S06E21,JERRY,Hey.
S06E21,KRAMER,"Hey, Frank."
S06E21,FRANK,Don't Frank me! I know what you did. How dare you stop short with my wife!
S06E21,KRAMER,"C'mon, Frank, relax. I don't even know what you're talking about."
S06E21,FRANK,"You think I don't know, Assman?!! To think I almost split the profits on the Manssierre with you."
S06E21,KRAMER,Bro.
S06E21,FRANK,Manssierre!
S06E21,KRAMER,Bro!
S06E21,FRANK,Manssierre! You...!
S06E21,FRANK,Aah!!!
S06E21,JERRY,"Oh, my god!"
S06E21,JERRY,"If I wasn't there, I wouldn't have believed it."
S06E21,ELAINE,Me either.
S06E21,GEORGE,They say this guy's the best.
S06E21,JERRY,He had to use cork-screw pasta.
S06E21,KRAMER,"Jerry. Jerry, come here. Take a look at this."
S06E21,KRAMER,The name on the boat. Look at it.
S06E21,JERRY,Assman!
S06E21,KRAMER,"Yeah (points towards the doctor's office), he's the Assman! Jerry, *he's* the Assman!"
S06E21,DOCTOR,Which one is the son?
S06E21,GEORGE,(stands up) I am.
S06E21,DOCTOR,Ah. I'm Doctor Cooperman. I just want you to know that this won't take long. And he's going to be fine.
S06E21,KRAMER,"Yeah, excuse me, uh... You didn't by any chance recently get the wrong license plates?"
S06E21,DR. COOPERMAN,Yes. I'm still waiting for the motor vehicle bureau to straighten it out.
S06E21,KRAMER,So...you're the Assman.
S06E21,FRANK,"It was a million to one shot, Doc. Million to one."
S06E21,ESTELLE,Where have you been?!! You were supposed to fix the stove! I've been waiting for hours!
S06E21,FRANK,I fell on some Fusilli.
S06E21,ESTELLE,Fusilli?
S06E21,FRANK,"You know, the corkscrew pasta. It was a Fusilli Jerry. It got stuck in me. Had to go to the proctologist."
S06E21,ESTELLE,The proctologist? Are you okay?
S06E21,FRANK,Yeah.
S06E21,ESTELLE,"Oh, I was so worried. (grabs a couple of tissues from the box)"
S06E21,GEORGE,"Ma, don't cry!"
S06E21,ESTELLE,"Oh, I can't help it!"
S06E21,GEORGE,"Ma, your eyes!"
S06E21,ESTELLE,Oh!
S06E22,JERRY,"What time does your flight get in? Six? All right, that gives us six hours. Then I'll meet you at the diplomat's club. I'll be the one without the big red sash. Okay, see you tonight. (Hangs up)"
S06E22,ELAINE,Is that the supermodel?
S06E22,JERRY,"Yep, she's not gonna be back for a month, but I got six hours."
S06E22,ELAINE,I thought you had a show in Ithaca.
S06E22,JERRY,"I do, but it's three o'clock and then I'm flying right back and meeting Bridget at the Diplomat's Club in the airport."
S06E22,ELAINE,"Well, guess what I'm doing. I'm going to Mr. Pitt's, and I am telling him that I am quitting."
S06E22,JERRY,So that's it? You know I never even met the guy.
S06E22,ELAINE,I've had enough. I am marchin' in.
S06E22,JERRY,You're marchin' in.
S06E22,ELAINE,I'm marchin'. (Enter George)
S06E22,GEORGE,Hey.
S06E22,JERRY,Hey. Elaine's quitting.
S06E22,GEORGE,Really?
S06E22,ELAINE,I'm marchin' in.
S06E22,GEORGE,I've done the march in. Best feeling in the world.
S06E22,JERRY,How 'bout the march out?
S06E22,GEORGE,Not as good. That's when you realize all the money you're losing.
S06E22,ELAINE,This is it. Wish me luck.
S06E22,JERRY,Get a march goin'! March it! (She exits)
S06E22,GEORGE,"Jerry, I need to borrow your camera."
S06E22,JERRY,Why?
S06E22,GEORGE,"Well, I wanna put a picture of me and my boss Mr. Morgan up at the office."
S06E22,JERRY,What for?
S06E22,GEORGE,"They're reorganizing the staff, and I'm on thin ice with this guy as it is."
S06E22,JERRY,Isn't putting this guy's picture on your desk a little transparent?
S06E22,GEORGE,It better be.
S06E22,ELAINE,"Mr. Pitt, I have something to tell you."
S06E22,PITT,One second Elaine.
S06E22,ELAINE,Mr. Pitt...
S06E22,PITT,"Elaine, you know what I just did? I just amended my will to include you as a beneficiary."
S06E22,ELAINE,What?
S06E22,PITT,"Well, I think of you as part of my family. You've come to be like a daughter to me and I want to make sure you're taken care of after I'm gone."
S06E22,ELAINE,(Flattered) Mr. Pitt...
S06E22,PITT,"(Sneezes) Elaine, I feel a cold coming on. Could you get me a cold pill from the medicine cabinet?"
S06E22,ELAINE,"Oh no no, Mr. Pitt, you mustn't. You have to check with the pharmacy before you combine anything with your heart medicine,"
S06E22,PITT,"Yes, yes, I'll check with the pharmacist."
S06E22,ELAINE,"We don't want anything to happen to you Mr. Pitt. We want you to live a long, long time."
S06E22,GEORGE,"(Holding camera) Look at this, I only have one picture left... How 'bout a shot of me and Mr. Morgan?"
S06E22,MORGAN,Why?
S06E22,GEORGE,"Why? Because we're a team! C'mon! Would you take this for us, dear? Thank you very much. Here we go... (To Morgan) Anyone ever tell you you look a lot like Sugar Ray Leonard? Yeah, you must get that all the time."
S06E22,MORGAN,"I suppose we all look alike to you, right Costanza?"
S06E22,GEORGE,"No, not a racial thing, there really is a resemblance..."
S06E22,ELAINE,Oh my God.
S06E22,WOMAN,Who are you?
S06E22,PITT,This is the girl I want to put in my will. Elaine...
S06E22,MAN,"Please, rest Mr. Pitt."
S06E22,WOMAN,You're the assistant? Why weren't you taking care of him?
S06E22,ELAINE,"Well, he gave me the morning off, I was doing a little... shopping. How did this happen?"
S06E22,MAN,Took a very dangerous combination prescription heart medicine and these other pills.
S06E22,ELAINE,"Mr. Pitt, you were s'posed to talk with the pharmacist."
S06E22,PITT,I spoke to someone who worked there.
S06E22,ELAINE,I'm gonna go and call that pharmacist. (She exits)
S06E22,WOMAN,How well do you know her?
S06E22,KATE,"Jerry, listen, just so you know, before we take off they're gonna tell us what to do in the vent of a crash-"
S06E22,JERRY,"Yes, I know. I've flown before."
S06E22,KATE,Oh good. I just didn't want you to freak out... The chance of a crash is very slim. Do you have to go to the bathroom?
S06E22,JERRY,No.
S06E22,KATE,(Pause) Because even if you have (Jerry gets up to go) to go a little you'd better go now because you won't get another chance until way after take off.
S06E22,KRAMER,"Hey, how you doin'?"
S06E22,EARL,Pretty good.
S06E22,KRAMER,Name's Kramer.
S06E22,EARL,"Earl Hafler, nice to meet you. I'm headed to Houston, where you headed?"
S06E22,KRAMER,"Oh I'm happy right here. Isn't this place amazing? Planes flying in from all corners of the world, and they know the minute they're arriving."
S06E22,EARL,"Ah they don't know a darn thing. That's why my flight the Houston's been delayed. They're all morons. Matter of fact, I'll bet you that that flight to Pittsburgh takes off before my flight to Houston."
S06E22,KRAMER,"Bet? Um, not betting."
S06E22,EARL,Friendly wager.
S06E22,KRAMER,"I haven't made a bet in three years, I-"
S06E22,EARL,"Ah c'mon. Keep things interesting, pass the time."
S06E22,KRAMER,"Okay, how much?"
S06E22,EARL,How 'bout 200?
S06E22,KRAMER,"You're on, cowboy!"
S06E22,GEORGE,How ya doin'?
S06E22,MAN,Okay.
S06E22,GEORGE,Nice day today.
S06E22,MAN,What?
S06E22,GEORGE,"I'm George. George Costanza, you live around here?"
S06E22,INTERCOM,Now arriving at gate 12...
S06E22,EARL,This could be Mexico City.
S06E22,KRAMER,"C'mon Seattle, let's go."
S06E22,EARL,"Come on, Mexico City!"
S06E22,KRAMER,"Seattle, yeah!"
S06E22,INTERCOM,...flight 42 from Mexico City.
S06E22,KRAMER,"All right, c'mon, let's go again."
S06E22,ELAINE,"Mr. Pitt, do you need anything?"
S06E22,PITT,No.
S06E22,ELAINE,You need something to sit up. Why don't I get you a pillow?
S06E22,PITT,Okay.
S06E22,KATE,"It's a pretty full house, the lighting guy's name is Lew, he's got a birthday next week."
S06E22,JERRY,I don't care.
S06E22,KATE,"By the way, Jerry, I don't want you to freak out, but the pilot is going to be in the audience."
S06E22,JERRY,Who?
S06E22,KATE,Remember the plane we took here? The pilot is gonna be sitting out there watching the show.
S06E22,JERRY,"I don't care, why are you telling me this?"
S06E22,KATE,I just didn't want you to freak out when you saw him.
S06E22,JERRY,Why would I freak out? (To himself) Pilot...
S06E22,Off stage,"Ladies and gentlemen, a big hand for Mr. Jerry Seinfeld! (Clapping)"
S06E22,JERRY,"Hey, all right. Good afternoon Ithaca. Welcome, good to see you here... Boy, I'll tell you, there's an awful lot of those orange cones you have on the throughway... (Sees pilot) on the way... up here... um... I.."
S06E22,KATE,"It didn't go very well, did it?"
S06E22,JERRY,"No, it didn't. And you know why? Seeing the pilot in the audience really freaked me out."
S06E22,KATE,I knew it.
S06E22,JERRY,"If you hadn't mentioned anything, I would have been fine. I became obsessed with him."
S06E22,KATE,"Why did we invite him? Stupid, stupid. when he asked for a ticket, I should have said no. I'm gonna go chew him out."
S06E22,JERRY,"Oh, it doesn't matter now."
S06E22,KATE,"Don't worry, Jerry. I'm on top of this."
S06E22,JERRY,"Yeah, you're on top of it, and I'm on the bottom!"
S06E22,EARL,"Well, Mr. Kramer, looks like you're in the hole $3200... Will that be cash or check?"
S06E22,KRAMER,"All right, look, one more bet. Double or nothing. C'mon."
S06E22,EARL,"All right, but I wanna see some cash on the table."
S06E22,KRAMER,"All right, let me call my bank. You stay here. (He calls)"
S06E22,NEWMAN,Hello?
S06E22,KRAMER,"Yeah, it's, uh, me."
S06E22,NEWMAN,"Hey, what's up?"
S06E22,KRAMER,"All right, listen. I need some cash."
S06E22,NEWMAN,What for?
S06E22,KRAMER,"I just need it, that's all."
S06E22,NEWMAN,"Oh no. Don't tell me. You're gambling again, aren't you? Oh you weak, weak man. Where are you?"
S06E22,KRAMER,I'm at the airport.
S06E22,NEWMAN,The airport?
S06E22,KRAMER,"We've been betting on arrivals and departures. (Newman rolls eyes) But I'm down $3200 , so you've gotta get me some cash."
S06E22,NEWMAN,I don't have that kinda dough.
S06E22,KRAMER,Sure you do.
S06E22,NEWMAN,"Oh no, no, not the bag!"
S06E22,KRAMER,"Oh help me man, I'm desperate!"
S06E22,NEWMAN,"All right, all right."
S06E22,INTERCOM,"Sorry for the delay, folks, there is a slight complication that we're taking care of, and then we'll be on our way to La Guardia..."
S06E22,JERRY,(To Katie) What is the complication?
S06E22,FLIGHT ATTENDANT,Mr. Seinfeld?
S06E22,JERRY,Yes?
S06E22,FLIGHT ATTENDANT,"I'm sorry, but the pilot has asked that you leave this plane."
S06E22,JERRY,What?
S06E22,FLIGHT ATTENDANT,"Apparently, he has some sort of problem with you."
S06E22,KATE,"I'm not surprised. I really let him have it, Jerry. He has no business being in your audience if you didn't want him there."
S06E22,JERRY,I didn't care.
S06E22,FLIGHT ATTENDANT,"Well, now the pilot doesn't want you on his plane."
S06E22,JERRY,He can't just throw me off the plane!
S06E22,FLIGHT ATTENDANT,"Yes he can, if he has cause to believe a passenger will be a disturbance."
S06E22,JERRY,But I'm not a disturbance!
S06E22,FLIGHT ATTENDANT,"Well, apparently you are disturbing him, sir."
S06E22,JERRY,But someone is waiting for me!
S06E22,KATE,"Jerry, I don't want you to freak out."
S06E22,JERRY,I'm freakin' out! I am freakin' out!
S06E22,KATE,"There's a flight leaving at eight, and another one at eight-thirty, which one do you want?"
S06E22,JERRY,Which one do you think I want?
S06E22,KATE,The eight will get you in a little earlier.
S06E22,JERRY,Then we'll make it the eight.
S06E22,KATE,"I'll book a hotel, do you want a standard room or mini suite?]"
S06E22,JERRY,Hotel?
S06E22,KATE,"Yeah, it's eight in the morning."
S06E22,JERRY,"No, no, no. I have to get home tonight. Bridget's gonna be waiting for me at the Diplomat's Club. Rent a car."
S06E22,KATE,"Mid-size, luxury, or sports model, what's your preference?"
S06E22,JERRY,"I don't have a preference, okay! Just make a decision yourself! Stop bothering me with every minor little detail, please?"
S06E22,KATE,"Okay, you're a big celebrity. (She exits)"
S06E22,GEORGE,Yo.
S06E22,JERRY,George.
S06E22,GEORGE,"Hey, Jerry, how was Ithaca?"
S06E22,JERRY,"I'm still here. Listen, you gotta go down to the Diplomat's Club..."
S06E22,GEORGE,"Hey, Jerry, what was the name of the exterminator who fumigated your apartment when you had fleas?"
S06E22,JERRY,"Carl, I think."
S06E22,GEORGE,"Carl... Yeah, he was a nice guy."
S06E22,JERRY,"Yeah, he was nice."
S06E22,GEORGE,What company was it?
S06E22,JERRY,Defent.
S06E22,GEORGE,"Yeah, you know we spoke for a little bit..."
S06E22,JERRY,You need an exterminator?
S06E22,GEORGE,"No, not really."
S06E22,JERRY,"Oh, don't tell me. 'Cause he's black?"
S06E22,GEORGE,Gotta go.
S06E22,JERRY,"George, George!"
S06E22,JERRY,"Hello, this is Jerry Seinfeld. Is Elaine there?"
S06E22,WOMAN,"Hold on... Elaine, there's a Jerry Seinfeld on the phone for you."
S06E22,ELAINE,Hello?
S06E22,JERRY,"Elaine, I need you to do me a big favor. I need you to go down to the Diplomat's Club and meet Bridget for me. I'm going to be late."
S06E22,ELAINE,"That's at the airport, right?"
S06E22,JERRY,"Right, I don't want Bridget to think I stood her up. I'll never get another date with her. She'll freak out."
S06E22,ELAINE,"All right, all right. You sound a little freaked out yourself."
S06E22,JERRY,I am a little freaked out!
S06E22,ELAINE,"Calm down, I'll take care of it. (Ms. Walker looks suspicious of Elaine)"
S06E22,JERRY,"All right, but you have to go now."
S06E22,ELAINE,I said I'll take care of it!
S06E22,NEWMAN,Kramer.
S06E22,KRAMER,Hey.
S06E22,NEWMAN,"Okay, here it is."
S06E22,KRAMER,Good. (To Earl) Here's my collateral.
S06E22,EARL,"So it's a mailbag, so what?"
S06E22,NEWMAN,So what? Do you know whose mailbag that is?
S06E22,EARL,(Reading) David Berkowitz.
S06E22,NEWMAN,Son of Sam. The worst mass murderer the post office ever produced.
S06E22,EARL,Where did you get this?
S06E22,NEWMAN,"I took over his route. And boy, were there a lot of dogs on that route."
S06E22,EARL,Any of 'em talk to you?
S06E22,NEWMAN,Just to tell me to keep off the snacks!
S06E22,EARL,(To Kramer) Your buddy's a helluva guy.
S06E22,KRAMER,"Yeah, don't I know it."
S06E22,EARL,"Okay, Cosmo, we're back in business. Let's check out the board. Now, who do you like?"
S06E22,KRAMER,"All right, how 'bout Ithaca vs. Boston?"
S06E22,EARL,"All right, I'll give you a sportin' chance. I'll take Ithaca."
S06E22,KRAMER,Double or nothin'.
S06E22,EARL,Double or nothin'.
S06E22,NEWMAN,I hope you know what you're doing... (Kramer gives Newman a look of lack of confidence)
S06E22,JERRY,(Wakes up) Where are we?
S06E22,KATE,I'm not sure.
S06E22,JERRY,Is this even a road?
S06E22,KATE,Oh we lost the road a half hour ago.
S06E22,JERRY,What? Why didn't you wake me up?
S06E22,KATE,You told me not to bother you with minor details.
S06E22,JERRY,"No, road is a major detail!"
S06E22,KATE,"Okay, now I know. Should I keep going or turn around, do you have a preference?"
S06E22,JERRY,(Pointing ahead) Look out!
S06E22,GEORGE,May I help you?
S06E22,CARL,I'm the exterminator.
S06E22,GEORGE,"Oh, yes of course, come in."
S06E22,CARL,Why didn't you want me to bring my equipment or wear my uniform?
S06E22,GEORGE,"Yes, well, if the other people in the office saw that I called an exterminator, they would just panic. Besides, this is sort of a friendly visit. Carl, right?"
S06E22,CARL,Do I know you?
S06E22,GEORGE,"Yeah, sure, we met at Jerry Seinfeld's apartment. When you fumigated for fleas over there."
S06E22,CARL,"Seinfeld... Oh yeah, funny white guy, right?"
S06E22,GEORGE,"Jerry? Yes, I suppose he is white. You know, I never really thought about it. I don't see people in terms of color. You know, there's someone I'd like you to meet. Hand on... (To phone) Is Mr. Morgan in?"
S06E22,PHONE,Mr. Morgan left for dinner.
S06E22,GEORGE,"He left... huh... Carl, you hungry?"
S06E22,TV,"Here's a new twist on car pooling Early this morning, a lost Manhattanite drove through a residential backyard and wound up in a swimming pool near Ithaca, New York. Comedian Jerry Seinfeld, a passenger, seemed a little freaked out."
S06E22,JERRY,That's it! No more questions! I don't care!
S06E22,PITT,That's him! That's the man who gave me the pills in the drug store! He's no pharmacist.
S06E22,WOMANEWMAN,Jerry Seinfeld... I know that name. He called here earlier for Elaine. (She looks at Mr. Pitt)
S06E22,GEORGE,"(To Carl) Oh, by the way, order anything you want, it's all on me. Just do me a tiny favor pretend we're old friends. Oh my God! Mr. Morgan! What a coincidence, it's Mr. Morgan. Mr. Morgan, I want you to meet a dear old friend of mine, Carl."
S06E22,CARL,I'm the exterminator. (Morgan confused)
S06E22,GEORGE,"That's... what we used to call him in high school, the exterminator. He's a linebacker. Oh, did we have some wild times."
S06E22,EARL,"Well, that Newman was your good luck charm."
S06E22,KRAMER,"Yeah, he was."
S06E22,EARL,I should have quitted at double or nothin'. Travelers checks acceptable?
S06E22,KRAMER,Oh I accept.
S06E22,NEWMANEWMAN,(Talking to another man) ...yeah he worked in the cubicle right next to me. We once double dated.
S06E22,KRAMER,"Yeah, it's a pleasure doin' business with a gentleman like yourself. (Elaine enters)"
S06E22,ELAINE,Kramer.
S06E22,KRAMER,Oh hi Elaine. What are you doing here?
S06E22,ELAINE,Jerry asked me to meet his girlfriend here. Did you here about his plane in Ithaca?
S06E22,EARL,What about the plane in Ithaca?
S06E22,ELAINE,"Oh, our stupid friend freaked out the pilot. Single handedly delayed the plane a whole hour. Can you believe that?"
S06E22,KRAMER,Boy...
S06E22,EARL,Your friend caused the delay?
S06E22,ELAINE,Uh huh.
S06E22,EARL,You're a cheat! Nobody hustles Earl Hafler.
S06E22,KRAMER,C'mon!
S06E22,EARL,"See you around, Cosmo."
S06E22,KRAMER,What?
S06E22,ELAINE,"Poison you? Jerry Seinfeld tried to poison you? Wha? Mr. Pitt, what are you, delirious? He's never even met you!"
S06E22,PITT,"You're fired, Elaine. Goodbye."
S06E22,ELAINE,Goodbye? (Elaine thinks of memories with Mr. Pitt)
S06E22,JERRY,Bridget!
S06E22,BRIDGET,"Jerry, what happened?"
S06E22,JERRY,"Oh, I'm so sorry. I got stuck out of town. I missed our whole time together."
S06E22,BRIDGET,"Well, my plane doesn't leave for another half hour."
S06E22,JERRY,"Really? (They start to make out, Jerry sees the pilot on the plane) Oh my God, that's him! That's the pilot!"
S06E22,GEORGE,"I love this place. You know, Carl and I come here all the time."
S06E22,MORGANEWMAN,Is that right?
S06E22,CARL,"Yeah, I come here all the time. You wouldn't believe the rat problems in the kitchen."
S06E22,MORGANEWMAN,"(George spits out food) I thought so. You really are an exterminator. This time, George, you've sunk to a new low. (He leaves)"
S06E22,GEORGE,"Check, please."
S06E22,WAITER,"Hey, Sugar Ray Leonard can eat here on the house."
S06E22,GEORGE,Mr. Morgan! Did you hear that? Mr. Morgan!
S06E23,GEORGE,"Take toilet paper for example. Do you realize that toilet paper has not changed in my lifetime? It's just paper on a cardboard roll, that's it. And in ten thousand years, it will still be exactly the same because really, what else can they do?"
S06E23,SIENA,That's true. There really has been no development in toilet paper.
S06E23,GEORGE,"And everything else has changed. But toilet paper is exactly the same, and will be so until we're dead."
S06E23,SIENA,"Yeah, you're right George. What else can they do?"
S06E23,GEORGE,"It's just paper on a roll, that's it. And that's all it will ever be."
S06E23,SIENA,Wow.
S06E23,GEORGE,"You find this interesting, don't you?"
S06E23,SIENA,"Yes. yes, I do."
S06E23,ELAINE,"(to the busboy) Oh, thanks very much, the soup was really good."
S06E23,JERRY,What are you telling him for?
S06E23,ELAINE,What?
S06E23,JERRY,"He's the busboy, you think he cares about the soup?"
S06E23,ELAINE,"Yeah, why? Wouldn't he want the soup to be good?"
S06E23,JERRY,"Elaine, it's all this guy can do to keep from killing himself. You think he's back there, talking to the chef, going, ""Hey, they like the soup! Keep it up!""?"
S06E23,ELAINE,"Hey, isn't that Alec Berg?"
S06E23,JERRY,"Yep, Alec Berg. He's got a good 'John Houseman' name. Alec Beeerg. Mr. Beeerg."
S06E23,ELAINE,"I can't stand him, he is so pretentious."
S06E23,JERRY,John Houseman?
S06E23,ELAINE,"No, Alec Berg."
S06E23,ALEC,(approaching) Elaine!
S06E23,ELAINE,Hi!
S06E23,ALEC,"Hi, how are you? Jerry."
S06E23,JERRY,"Hi, Alec."
S06E23,ALEC,Did you hear about Gary Fogel?
S06E23,JERRY,Yeah.
S06E23,ALEC,You gonna go to the funeral on Friday?
S06E23,JERRY,"Yeah, hey did I see you on TV at the Ranger game? Were those your seats right behind the glass?"
S06E23,ALEC,"Those are them, yeah. Season tickets. Uh, you know, unfortunately I can't go tonight, so they're available if you'd like to use them."
S06E23,JERRY,"Oh, I'd love to, are you sure?"
S06E23,ALEC,"Absolutely, you just call my secretary, she'll arrange everything."
S06E23,JERRY,Gee thanks! Thanks a lot!
S06E23,ALEC,"It's my pleasure. Be good. (Walking away, he stops abruptly) You know, I actually might not use them on Friday either so I'll let you know."
S06E23,JERRY,"Alright, thanks again."
S06E23,ELAINE,Thank you very much.
S06E23,JERRY,"Really, thank you."
S06E23,JERRY,Well what about these nitwits that get on a plane with nothing to read? You know who these people are?
S06E23,ELAINE,Who?
S06E23,JERRY,"These are the people that want to talk to you. They got nothing else to do, why not disturb you?"
S06E23,ELAINE,I will never understand people.
S06E23,JERRY,They're the worst.
S06E23,GEORGE,"Something's up, there's something in the air."
S06E23,JERRY,"Well, what is with you?"
S06E23,GEORGE,"Well, I think this is it."
S06E23,ELAINE,What's it?
S06E23,GEORGE,I saw Siena again.
S06E23,ELAINE,Siena?
S06E23,JERRY,"Yeah, he's dating a crayon."
S06E23,GEORGE,We discussed toilet paper.
S06E23,JERRY,Toilet paper?
S06E23,GEORGE,"Yeah, I told her how toilet paper hasn't changed in my lifetime, and probably wouldn't change in the next fifty thousand years and she was fascinated, fascinated!"
S06E23,JERRY,What are you talking about?
S06E23,ELAINE,Yeah.
S06E23,JERRY,Toilet paper's changed.
S06E23,ELAINE,Yeah.
S06E23,JERRY,It's softer.
S06E23,ELAINE,Softer.
S06E23,JERRY,More sheets per roll
S06E23,ELAINE,Sheets.
S06E23,JERRY,Comes in a wide variety of colors.
S06E23,ELAINE,Colors.
S06E23,GEORGE,"Ok, ok, fine! It's changed, it's not really the point. Anyway, I'm thinking of making a big move."
S06E23,JERRY,What?
S06E23,GEORGE,"I might tell her that I love her. I came this close last night, then I just chickened out."
S06E23,JERRY,"Well, that's a big move, Georgie boy. Are you confident in the 'I love you' return?"
S06E23,GEORGE,Fifty-fifty.
S06E23,JERRY,"Cause if you don't get that return, that's a pretty big matzoh ball hanging out there."
S06E23,GEORGE,"Aw, I've just got to say it once, everybody else gets to say it, why can't I say it?"
S06E23,ELAINE,"What, you never said it?"
S06E23,GEORGE,"Once, to a dog. He licked himself and left the room."
S06E23,JERRY,"Well, so it wasn't a total loss."
S06E23,KRAMER,Hey.
S06E23,JERRY,"Hey, I forgot to tell you! I got tickets to the Rangers-Devils playoff game tonight!"
S06E23,KRAMER,"Oh, I'm there, Monongahela!"
S06E23,JERRY,"What about you, George?"
S06E23,GEORGE,"Eh eh eh, can't do it, can't do it, sorry, I got a date."
S06E23,KRAMER,"So, so."
S06E23,GEORGE,"Oh no no no, if you must know, I would rather be with her than go to the game."
S06E23,KRAMER,"She must be a very special lady, huh George, yeah."
S06E23,JERRY,"Well, what do I do with the extra ticket?"
S06E23,ELAINE,"Oh hey, can I bring David Puddy? He's a big Devils' fan."
S06E23,JERRY,"Sure, fine with me."
S06E23,GEORGE,"Hey, by the way, if anybody wants an inside tour of the zoo, Siena works there as a trainer."
S06E23,KRAMER,So she works at the zoo?
S06E23,GEORGE,"Yeah, yeah."
S06E23,KRAMER,"Yeah, like Diane Fosse. You know she's the only person that's ever been accepted into gorilla society. And you know, once those gorillas accept you, you got it made in the shade."
S06E23,ELAINE,So how long have you been a Devils' fan?
S06E23,PUDDY,"(off camera) Since I was a kid, I'm from Jersey."
S06E23,ELAINE,"Yeah? Well, we're gonna kick your butts tonight."
S06E23,PUDDY,"Hey, no way, man."
S06E23,ELAINE,Yes.
S06E23,PUDDY,We're primed.
S06E23,ELAINE,"Alright, you almost ready? Cause Jerry and Kramer are gonna be here any second."
S06E23,ELAINE,What the--
S06E23,PUDDY,So what do you think?
S06E23,ELAINE,What is that?
S06E23,PUDDY,I painted my face.
S06E23,ELAINE,(still in disbelief) You painted your face?
S06E23,PUDDY,Yeah.
S06E23,ELAINE,Why?
S06E23,PUDDY,"You know, support the team."
S06E23,ELAINE,"Well, you can't walk around like that."
S06E23,PUDDY,Why not?
S06E23,ELAINE,Because it's insane?
S06E23,PUDDY,"Hey, you gotta let them know you're out there, this is the playoffs."
S06E23,KRAMER,Hey.
S06E23,PUDDY,Hey.
S06E23,ELAINE,"Dave, um, painted his face."
S06E23,KRAMER,"Yeah, that's cool. Well, you gotta support your team."
S06E23,PUDDY,"Ok, ready to go?"
S06E23,KRAMER,Yeah.
S06E23,PUDDY,(startlingly loud) LET'S GET IT ON!!! Alright!! Go Devils!! Go Devils!! Let's go Devils!!
S06E23,PUDDY,"You're dead, Messier! We're gonna get you, Messier!"
S06E23,FAN #1,Will you sit down?
S06E23,PUDDY,"Hey man, I'm just trying to support the team."
S06E23,ELAINE,Will you sit down? You're disturbing everybody. Sit down!
S06E23,PUDDY,"Oh yeah, because you're a Ranger fan and you know I'm messing with their heads."
S06E23,PUDDY,Go Devils!!
S06E23,RADIO ANNOUNCER,Devils goal! Stephan Richer scores from just inside the blue line! And the Devils take-- (George turns down the volume)
S06E23,GEORGE,"You know, I could have actually gone to that."
S06E23,SIENA,So why didn't you?
S06E23,GEORGE,"Well, I didn't want to break our date."
S06E23,SIENA,"Oh, well."
S06E23,GEORGE,Because I... I love you.
S06E23,SIENA,"You know, I'm hungry. Let's get something to eat."
S06E23,PUDDY,"Ha ha! We took it to you! You couldn't get it out of your zone all night. We were aggressive, we didn't let you penetrate!"
S06E23,KRAMER,"Alright, that's enough out of you, there's still three more games left in this series, my friend, and it's far from being over. Very far from being over. (Notices a car coming right towards Puddy, who's crossing the street) Watch out!"
S06E23,PUDDY,"(pounding the hood) Hey, what are you doing?! Watch where you're driving, man! (He approaches the passenger side window) Don't mess with the Devils, buddy. We're number one, we beat anybody! We're the Devils! The Devils!! Haaaa!!!"
S06E23,FATHER HERNANDEZ,El Diablo! Dios mio! El Diablo!!
S06E23,JERRY,"""I'm hungry. Let's get something to eat."""
S06E23,GEORGE,Yup.
S06E23,JERRY,Big matzoh ball.
S06E23,GEORGE,Huge matzoh ball.
S06E23,JERRY,Those damn 'I love you' returns.
S06E23,GEORGE,"Well, it's all over. I slipped up."
S06E23,JERRY,"Oh, you don't know."
S06E23,GEORGE,"You have any idea how fast these things deteriorate when there's an 'I love you' out of the bag? You can't have a relationship where one person says, ""I love you"", and the other says, ""I'm hungry. Let's get something to eat.""."
S06E23,JERRY,Unless you're married.
S06E23,GEORGE,"I mean, now she thinks that I'm one of these guys that love her. Nobody wants to be with somebody that loves them."
S06E23,JERRY,"No, people hate that."
S06E23,GEORGE,You want to be with somebody that doesn't like you.
S06E23,JERRY,Ideally.
S06E23,GEORGE,I am never saying 'I love you' again unless they say it first.
S06E23,WAITRESS,Matzoh ball soup?
S06E23,GEORGE,That'd be me.
S06E23,KRAMER,"Hey, Jerry? You're a smart guy, right?"
S06E23,JERRY,No question about it.
S06E23,KRAMER,"Alright, you know I'm supposed to go on this special tour today with George's girlfriend."
S06E23,JERRY,At the zoo?
S06E23,KRAMER,"Yeah, but before I met up with her, I stopped to look at the monkeys, when all of a sudden I am hit in the face with a banana peel. I turn and look and there is this monkey really laughing it up. Then someone tells me that he did it. Well, I pick up the banana peel and I wait for that monkey to turn around. And then I *whap* let him have it."
S06E23,JERRY,"Kramer, you threw a banana peel at a monkey?"
S06E23,KRAMER,"Well, he started it!"
S06E23,JERRY,"It's a monkey, Kramer!"
S06E23,KRAMER,"Well, he pushed my buttons, I couldn't help it, Jerry."
S06E23,JERRY,"Well, I still think it's wrong."
S06E23,KRAMER,"Alright, alright, fine. You take the monkey's side, alright, go ahead."
S06E23,JERRY,I'm not taking anyone's side.
S06E23,KRAMER,"(walking out) Cause I know what happened, Jerry. (remembering something and walking back in) Did you call Alec Berg and thank him for the hockey tickets?"
S06E23,JERRY,No.
S06E23,KRAMER,"Oh, Jerry, what are you waiting for?"
S06E23,JERRY,"What do I gotta call him for? I thanked him five times when he gave them to me, how many time I gotta thank him?"
S06E23,KRAMER,"Oh, no no no, you gotta call him the next day, it's common courtesy."
S06E23,JERRY,"No, I don't believe in it. I'm taking a stand against all this over thanking."
S06E23,KRAMER,"Jerry, good manners are the glue of society."
S06E23,JERRY,"Hey, if I knew I had to give him eight million 'thank you's, I wouldn't have taken the tickets in the first place."
S06E23,KRAMER,"Alright, you know what this is gonna do? He's gonna be upset because you didn't call him and we're not gonna get those tickets for Friday night."
S06E23,JERRY,"Ah, you're out of your mind."
S06E23,KRAMER,"Alright, where you going?"
S06E23,JERRY,"I gotta get a suit cleaned, I have a funeral on Friday."
S06E23,KRAMER,Who died?
S06E23,JERRY,Remember the guy who pretended he had cancer so O would buy him the toupee?
S06E23,KRAMER,So he actually had it?
S06E23,JERRY,"No, car accident. He was trying to adjust his toupee while he was driving and he lost control of the car."
S06E23,ELAINE,That poor priest. He was just visiting from El Salvador. Now he's gone completely loco.
S06E23,JERRY,The one Puddy screamed at in the car?
S06E23,ELAINE,Yeah. He thinks he saw the devil. He won't leave his room in the church basement.
S06E23,JERRY,"Well, that's what you get for getting mixed up with a face painter."
S06E23,ELAINE,"I mean, what compels a seemingly normal human being to do something like that?"
S06E23,JERRY,Gotta support the team.
S06E23,ELAINE,You know I really hate my clothes.
S06E23,JERRY,Hm.
S06E23,ELAINE,"I open up my closet, there's just nothing."
S06E23,JERRY,Hm.
S06E23,ELAINE,"Nothing. I hate everything I have, I really hate it. (The weeping increases in volume and intensity) I mean, at this point, it's like I can wear something three or four times and that's it."
S06E23,JERRY,Hm.
S06E23,ELAINE,It's getting to be a terrible problem for me.
S06E23,JERRY,"(noticing Alec Berg walk in, whispers) Hey, Alec!"
S06E23,JERRY,Did you see that? What kind of a 'hello' was that?
S06E23,MR. PLESS,"Ah, Mr. Kramer?"
S06E23,KRAMER,Yes.
S06E23,MR. PLESS,Thanks for coming.
S06E23,KRAMER,"So, uh, what did you want to see me about?"
S06E23,MR. PLESS,"Well, Mr. Kramer, to get right to it, we're having a bit of a problem with Barry."
S06E23,KRAMER,Barry?
S06E23,MR. PLESS,The chimpanzee.
S06E23,KRAMER,"Oh. Well, uh, what's the problem?"
S06E23,MR. PLESS,"Well, he's not functioning the way he normally does. He seems depressed. He's lost his appetite. He's even curtailed his autoerotic activities. And we think this is directly related to the altercation he had with you the other day."
S06E23,KRAMER,"So, so what do you want me to do?"
S06E23,MR. PLESS,"Well, frankly we'd like you to apologize."
S06E23,KRAMER,"Yeah, well he started it."
S06E23,MR. PLESS,"Mr. Kramer, he is an innocent primate."
S06E23,KRAMER,"So am I. What about my feelings? Don't my feelings count for anything? Oh, only the poor monkey's important. Everything has to be done for the monkey! Look, I'm sorry. I--"
S06E23,SIENA,"Hey, that's ok. Well, I've gotta go feed the marmosets."
S06E23,KRAMER,"(to Siena as she's walking out, but she appears to ignore) You know George really likes you."
S06E23,MR. PLESS,She doesn't hear too well out of her left ear.
S06E23,KRAMER,Oh.
S06E23,JERRY,"I mean, do you think it's possible that he's mad at me because he didn't get the day-after 'thank you'?"
S06E23,GEORGE,"Wait a minute, you were at a funeral, right?"
S06E23,JERRY,Yeah.
S06E23,GEORGE,"Well, people never give a good 'hello' at a funeral. I mean, they go like this (George gives an extremely understated nod) That's the biggest."
S06E23,JERRY,"Yeah, yeah, that's kinda what he gave me."
S06E23,GEORGE,"Hey, they can't go, ""Hey! You look fabulous!"""
S06E23,JERRY,Hey.
S06E23,KRAMER,"Hey. Well, I just spoke to your girlfriend."
S06E23,GEORGE,"Girlfriend, yeah, right."
S06E23,KRAMER,"Anyway, she asked me to apologize to Barry."
S06E23,GEORGE,Barry?
S06E23,KRAMER,The monkey.
S06E23,JERRY,Well?
S06E23,KRAMER,"Nothing doing. Jerry, I didn't do anything. It's the monkey that should be apologizing to me."
S06E23,JERRY,"Well, I don't think that's gonna happen."
S06E23,KRAMER,"Well, I'm sorry. Well, George, I tried to put the good word in for you with Siena, but I don't think she heard me. You know, left ear?"
S06E23,GEORGE,What?
S06E23,KRAMER,"Yeah, her boss told me that she can't hear very well out of her left ear. What, you didn't know that?"
S06E23,GEORGE,Oh my god.
S06E23,JERRY,What?
S06E23,GEORGE,She probably never heard it. Don't you see what this means? It's like the whole thing never happened. It's like when Superman reversed the rotation of the earth to save Lois Lane!
S06E23,JERRY,Are you gonna say it again?
S06E23,GEORGE,"That's the question, Jimmy."
S06E23,GEORGE,I'm gonna do it.
S06E23,JERRY,"What? After what you just went through, I thought you said you'd never say it again."
S06E23,GEORGE,I'd like to say it once to someone that can actually hear it!
S06E23,KRAMER,What's going on?
S06E23,JERRY,He's gonna talk into her other ear.
S06E23,KRAMER,"Oh. Well listen, I almost forgot to ask you. What happened at the funeral? Now, did you talk to Alec berg?"
S06E23,JERRY,"Yeah, I saw him."
S06E23,KRAMER,"Alright, so he's gonna give you the hockey tickets, huh?"
S06E23,JERRY,"Well, not exactly."
S06E23,KRAMER,"He's mad, isn't he? See, I knew it."
S06E23,JERRY,I don't know if he's mad.
S06E23,KRAMER,"Alright, so what happened when you saw him?"
S06E23,JERRY,"Well, I didn't really get a good 'hello', but see, I was at a funeral."
S06E23,KRAMER,Uh huh.
S06E23,JERRY,"See, so I don't know if I got a funeral 'hello' or he was mad because he didn't get his day-after 'thank you'."
S06E23,KRAMER,"See, I told you, Jerry, I told you!"
S06E23,JERRY,"Look, what do you want me to do?"
S06E23,KRAMER,I want you to get on this phone and give him his 'thank you'!
S06E23,JERRY,"No. No, I can't!"
S06E23,KRAMER,"Jerry, this is the way society functions. Aren't you a part of society? Because if you don't want to be a part of society, Jerry, why don't you just get in your car and move to the East Side!"
S06E23,JERRY,"Look, we got five hours before the game. I am betting it was a funeral 'hello'. He knows we're here, he knows the number, he knows we want to go. There's plenty of time for him to call and give us the tickets."
S06E23,KRAMER,"You stubborn, stupid, silly man!"
S06E23,PUDDY,"Hey, great dip. You made this?"
S06E23,ELAINE,"No, it's from the store."
S06E23,PUDDY,"Oh. Hey, how come people don't have dip for dinner? Why is it only a snack, why can't it be a meal, you know? I don't understand stuff like that."
S06E23,ELAINE,"David? David, I think we aught to talk."
S06E23,PUDDY,"Alright, that's cool."
S06E23,ELAINE,"David, I don't think we should see each other anymore."
S06E23,PUDDY,"You gotta be kidding, how come?"
S06E23,ELAINE,"Well, you see, David, you're a face painter."
S06E23,PUDDY,"Yeah, that's right."
S06E23,ELAINE,"Well, it's not that I don't like you, but, well to be perfectly honest, I'm just having some trouble getting past the face painting."
S06E23,PUDDY,"Well, alright, so you don't like the face painting, I just won't paint it anymore."
S06E23,ELAINE,"Yeah, but you like the face painting."
S06E23,PUDDY,"Well, I don't need to do it. It's not like a habit or anything."
S06E23,ELAINE,Oh. You mean you'd stop it for me?
S06E23,PUDDY,"Yeah, that's right."
S06E23,ELAINE,"That's so, that's so sweet."
S06E23,PUDDY,"Ah, c'mere. (They kiss) Alright, I gotta go home and get changed before the game. I'll be back, we'll make out."
S06E23,GEORGE,"Siena, I love you."
S06E23,SIENA,"Yeah, I know. I heard you the first time."
S06E23,GEORGE,Yeah. Just confirming.
S06E23,JERRY,"Hello? Oh, hi mom. No, listen, I was expecting somebody else. I'm sorry, I can't talk now, I gotta keep the line clear, I'll call you later. Yes, I know I have call waiting but I don't trust it in an emergency. Good bye."
S06E23,KRAMER,"Anyway, I um, I just want to say that I'm sorry. I lost my temper and I probably shouldn't have. I took it out on you and, look, if I've caused you any problems as a result of my behavior, well then, I'm sorry. I apologize. Even though, Barry, between me and you, we both know that you started it. I mean, who's kidding who? But they tell me that you're very upset, and god forbid I should disturb the very important monkey, I'm just hoping we can put this behind us, let's just move on with our lives, ok? So no hard feelings?"
S06E23,ELAINE,What is that?
S06E23,PUDDY,That's the letter 'D'.
S06E23,ELAINE,Why is the letter 'D' painted on your chest?
S06E23,PUDDY,"Well, I'm going to the game tonight, and me and these five other guys are gonna take our shirts off and spell out 'Devils'."
S06E23,ELAINE,But you said no more painting.
S06E23,PUDDY,"No, I said no more face painting, and as you can see this is not my face."
S06E23,ELAINE,"Yeah, that's right."
S06E23,KRAMER,Well? Did he call?
S06E23,JERRY,No.
S06E23,KRAMER,"Oh, come on, Jerry! Come on, this is stupid! It's six o'clock! It's all over, just pick up the phone and thank him!"
S06E23,JERRY,"Alright! (picks up the phone and dials) Hello, Alec? Hi, it's Jerry Seinfeld. You know, you got a great 'John Houseman' name. Alec Berg. Did you hand in your assignment, Mr. Berg?"
S06E23,ALEC,"What can I do for you, Jerry?"
S06E23,JERRY,"Well, Alec, the reason I called is I just wanted to thank you for the tickets from the other night."
S06E23,ALEC,"I wish you'd called me earlier, I could have given you my tickets for tonight."
S06E23,JERRY,"Oh, you already gave them away?"
S06E23,ALEC,"Yeah, but you know what? I have a friend, he's got a couple of seats. If you don't mind the nose bleed section, they're yours."
S06E23,JERRY,"No, we don't care, we just want to go."
S06E23,ALEC,"There is one little catch, though."
S06E23,PUDDY,"Hey, great game, huh?"
S06E23,PRIEST,Father Hernandez?
S06E23,FATHER HERNANDEZ,Huh?
S06E23,PRIEST,"Una senora que te vino a ver. Ella dice que tiene informacion muy importante, y que te puede ayudar. (Subtitled ""A woman here to see you, she has important information that could be helpful to you."")"
S06E23,FATHER HERNANDEZ,Bueno.
S06E23,PRIEST,"Al fini finalmente par el llover. (Subtitled ""Finally it stopped raining."")"
S06E23,FATHER HERNANDEZ,"Aha, bueno."
S06E23,ELAINE,Hello father.
S06E23,FATHER HERNANDEZ,Oh. La Madonna! Madre de Christo! Yo estoy lista!
S06E24,GENNICE,(Crying) (sob sob)
S06E24,JERRY,"(To himself) Now what am I supposed to do here? Shall I go over there? It's not like somebody died. It's ""Beaches"" for god's sake. If she was sitting next to me I'd put my arm around her. I can't be making a big move like going all the way over there. I can't. I won't."
S06E24,JERRY,"She calls me this morning and tells me she's upset I didn't console her. I mean it was ""Beaches"" for god's sake. What, what do you do in a situation like that?"
S06E24,GEORGE,Where were you?
S06E24,JERRY,I was sitting on the chair. She was over here on the couch.
S06E24,GEORGE,"Well you know, if you were sitting right next to her you'd have to console her no matter what."
S06E24,JERRY,Of course.
S06E24,GEORGE,"When you're talking about a movie like ""Beaches"", moving from the chair to the couch , . . . that's quite a voyage."
S06E24,JERRY,"yeah,"
S06E24,KRAMER,Hey.
S06E24,GEORGE,Hey. I gotta go.
S06E24,KRAMER,Where you going?
S06E24,JERRY,"The Improv is playing ""Rochelle Rochelle"" The musical."
S06E24,KRAMER,Really? What is Bette Midler playing? Is she going to be there?
S06E24,JERRY,She might be. She's the star of the show.
S06E24,KRAMER,"Bette Midler is going to be in the park today? Yeeee. Jerry, don't tease me."
S06E24,GEORGE,I didn't know you were such a Bette Midler fan.
S06E24,KRAMER,"So maybe I'll go down there and watch, uh? She'll be there, ,maybe."
S06E24,GEORGE,Gennice palying today?
S06E24,JERRY,"Yeah, maybe."
S06E24,KRAMER,Who's Gennice?
S06E24,JERRY,That's the understudy. I'm dating her.
S06E24,KRAMER,"Oh, uh, is this uh, Bette Midler's understudy?"
S06E24,JERRY,Yeah.
S06E24,KRAMER,"Oh, understudies are a very shifty bunch. The substitute teachers of the theater world."
S06E24,JERRY,I'm glad she's an understudy. I don't have to avoid going back stage and having to think of something to say.
S06E24,GEORGE,Going backstage is the worst. Especially when they stink. You know that's a real problem.
S06E24,JERRY,Just once I would like to tell someone they stink. You know what? I doidn't like the show. I didn't like you. It just really stunk. The whole thingreal bad. Stinkaroo. Thanks for the tickets though.
S06E24,RUBY,You late.
S06E24,ELAINE,I know I know. I didn't have change for the bus and they don't give change in this city. So they threw me off the bus
S06E24,RUBY,"""That's a shame"". You'll have to wait for Lotus now."
S06E24,ELAINE,How long do you think this will take. I have a millllioooon things to do.
S06E24,RUBY,"""Mustn't keep the princess waiting. Princess in a big hurry."" ""No change for bus"" ""Poor princess."""
S06E24,ELAINE,"What?, uh?"
S06E24,RUBY,"Nothing, won't be long."
S06E24,LOTUS,"""Princess wants a manicure."""
S06E24,SUNNY,"""Oh lucky me."""
S06E24,LOTUS,"""Oh, you got the princess."""
S06E24,ELAINE,What is so funny?
S06E24,RUBY,tell knock-knock joke.
S06E24,ELAINE,The Korean women were talking about me. I think they were calling me a dog.
S06E24,JERRY,How would you know? You don't speak Korean.
S06E24,ELAINE,Because this woman came in with a dog and Ruby called the dog the same word they used when they were pointing at mege ge ge
S06E24,KRAMER,"You know, maybe in Korean ""dog"" isn't an insult. Could be like the word ""fox"" to us. Oh, she's a DOG!"
S06E24,JERRY,Why don't you go to another nail shop?
S06E24,ELAINE,"Because they're the best Jerry, the best. Look. Maybe I'm just being paranoid."
S06E24,JERRY,What you need is a translator to go in the shop with you and tell you what they're saying.
S06E24,ELAINE,"Yeah, who speaks Korean?"
S06E24,JERRY,You know who speaks Korean?
S06E24,ELAINE,"No, who?"
S06E24,JERRY,George's father.
S06E24,ELAINE,You gotta' be kidding me. How does he speak Korean?
S06E24,JERRY,He used to go there a lot on business.
S06E24,ELAINE,What did he do?
S06E24,JERRY,"He sold religious articles the statues of Jesus, the virgin Mary, that were manufactured in Korea."
S06E24,ELAINE,"Uh,"
S06E24,JERRY,"George, does your father speak Korean?"
S06E24,GEORGE,"Yeah, he once bumped into reverend Yung Sun Moon."
S06E24,JERRY,"Oh, hi Gennice."
S06E24,GENNICE,Hi Jerry.
S06E24,JERRY,"This is George, this is Kramer."
S06E24,GENNICE,Nice to meet you.
S06E24,JERRY,Playing today?
S06E24,GENNICE,No. I'm on the bench today.
S06E24,JERRY,They really stick to that understudy rule.
S06E24,KRAMER,So she's coming?
S06E24,GENNICE,"Oh, yeah, she'll be here. . . .(DROPS HOT DOG) Oh no, my frankfurter, my frankfurter fell (sob sob sob sob) . It was really good. I can't believe that I dropped it. (sob sob sob sob)"
S06E24,JERRY,"It's okayit's just a hot dog, (still sobbing) everything is going to be okay."
S06E24,GENNICE,No it (sob) was really good.
S06E24,KRAMER,"Look it's Bette It's Bette! Ah, Ah, AH, . . . Bette, psst, hi."
S06E24,BETTE,Hi.
S06E24,KRAMER,"Uh, I just want to say I think you're wonderful."
S06E24,BETTE,"Uh, thank you."
S06E24,KRAMER,"Yeah, I've seen you in everything you've done."
S06E24,BETTE,Really?
S06E24,KRAMER,Anything I can get you? Water? They got ice over here.
S06E24,BETTE,What flavours do they have?
S06E24,KRAMER,"Chocolate, Lemon, and uh, Cherry."
S06E24,BETTE,How about Pineapple?
S06E24,KRAMER,"Pineapple, sure, alright, I'll be right back."
S06E24,ICE CREAM VENDER #1,"No pineapple. Just Cherry, Lemon and Tutti-Frutti"
S06E24,KRAMER,"Oh, uh, uh. (Leaves)"
S06E24,ELAINE,"Anyway, Mr. Costanza, what I want you to do is to come to the shop with me and tell me what they are saying. You do speak Korean?"
S06E24,FRANK,I once talked to the reverend Yung Son Moon. He bought two Jesus statues from me. He's a hell of a nice guy.
S06E24,ELAINE,"uh, ha."
S06E24,FRANK,Ever see that face on him? Like a Biiig apple pie.
S06E24,ELAINE,"Yeah, yeah. Uh, uh listen Mr. Costanza, if uh, if you do this for me I'll get you a manicure, I'll pay for it. Or you can get a pedicure if you want."
S06E24,FRANK,"No one is touching my feet. Between you and me, Elaine, I think I've got a foot odour problem."
S06E24,GEORGE,"I watched ""Beaches"" on cable last night. (wings?)  Give me a break."
S06E24,BETTE,Get some talent then you can mouth off.
S06E24,UMPIRE,Strike three.
S06E24,BETTE,What? Are you blind?
S06E24,UMPIRE,What?
S06E24,BETTE,"Nothing, nothing."
S06E24,FRANK,I had an affair with a Korean woman.
S06E24,ELAINE,"Uh, Mr. Costanza, I"
S06E24,FRANK,"No, I feel I need to unburden myself. I loved her very deeply. But the clash of cultures was too much. Her family would not accept me."
S06E24,ELAINE,"Mr. Costanza, I,"
S06E24,FRANK,"Maybe it was because I refused to take off my shoes. Again, the foot odour problem. Her father would look at me and say, "" eno enoa juang "". Which means, ""this guy - this is not my kind of guy""."
S06E24,ICE CREAM VENDER #2,Sure I got Pineapple.
S06E24,BETTE,Move it in. Move in everybody. Get your shrimp here. Shrimp on special today!
S06E24,JERRY,"Come on George, just loosen up."
S06E24,JERRY,Come on George.
S06E24,KRAMER,I GOT THE PINEAPPLE.  I GOT THE PINEAPPLE.
S06E24,JERRY,(to George) Keep going.
S06E24,GEORGE,Aaaaaah
S06E24,UMPIRE,SAFE!
S06E24,GEORGE,come on it's just a game.
S06E24,KRAMER,"(holding bette) Don't worry Kramer is going to take care of everything. See,, I got you Pineapple. I saw Beaches last night for the fourth time (sings) ""You are the wind"""
S06E24,TV,the show will go on but not Bette Midler. While playing softball in the park Ms. Midler was injured when another player thoughtlessly rammed her at home plate. All captured on amateur video tape. She will be out for two weeks from her Broadway show; Rochelle Rochelle - The Musical.
S06E24,GENNICE,. . . Thank you. (hugs Jerry and George)
S06E24,JERRY,Well we
S06E24,GENNICE,"No, please. This is the first time in my life (sobs) that anyone has ever done anything like this for me. I've always had to struggle so hard for everything I ever got. (sobbing) and I know this is going to be my big break. (sobbing)"
S06E24,JERRY,(with no emotion) It's okay. Everything is going to be all right.
S06E24,KRAMER,"Come on Jerry, open up. I KNOW YOU'RE IN THERE!"
S06E24,JERRY,Come back another time.
S06E24,KRAMER,SO...you're all in here together. How convenient. I hope you're all proud of yourselves.
S06E24,KRAMER,"So my dear you think you can get to Broadway. Well, let me tell you something. Broadway has no room for people like you. Not the Broadway I know. My Broadway takes people like you and eats them up and spits them out. My Broadway is the Broadway of Merman, and Martin, and Fontaine, and if you think you can build yourself up by knocking other people down... ...GOOD LUCK... (exits)"
S06E24,ELAINE,"Hi everyone. Um, this is my friend, Frank."
S06E24,RUBY,"What would you like today? Manicure, Pedicure?"
S06E24,FRANK,I'll take a manicure. I don't take my shoes off for anyone.
S06E24,RUBY,"""That's the least of his problems."""
S06E24,FRANK,What was that?
S06E24,ELAINE,What'd they say? What'd they say?
S06E24,FRANK,They made a derogatory comment about me.
S06E24,RUBY,"""She's with a man twice her age."" ""He doesn't look like he's got much money either."""
S06E24,LOTUS,"""Check out that sweater"". (all laughing)"
S06E24,RUBY,"""I think I saw a moth fly out of a pocket."""
S06E24,LOTUS,"""What happened to his tail?"""
S06E24,FRANK,"Okay, THAT'S IT! ""oki on awa"" Where's my tail? I heard every word you said. You got some nerve."
S06E24,KIM,That voice? It sounds so familiar. It reminds me of when I was ayoung girl in Korea and I met an American businessman. He was a very unusual man. Quick temperd with a strange halting way of speaking. We fell in love but when I brought him home to meet my father? He refused to take his shoes off. And there was a terrible fight.
S06E24,LOTUS,That man also refuses to take his shoes off.
S06E24,FRANK,(from other room) I never seen people treated like this!
S06E24,RUBY,You brought in a spy! . . . Get Out!
S06E24,KIM,Frank?
S06E24,FRANK,Kim?
S06E24,KRAMER,"(on phone) A turkey sandwich. A side of slaw,  you want whit e meat or dark?"
S06E24,BETTE,White meat.
S06E24,KRAMER,"Yeah, white meat. And if I see one piece of dark meat on there. It's your ass buster."
S06E24,BETTE,Get me one of those Black and White cookies.
S06E24,KRAMER,"yeah, all right, yeah. (hangs up) They don't have any. But don't worry I'm going to get you one somewhere."
S06E24,BETTE,Good. Because if I don't get a Black and White cookie I'm not going to be very pleasant to be around.
S06E24,KRAMER,Now that's impossible.
S06E24,ELAINE,(sob sob) (bumps into man with an umbrella)  I don't even know where I'm going.
S06E24,PETERMAN,That's the best way to get someplace you've never been.
S06E24,ELAINE,"yes, (sob) I suppose,"
S06E24,PETERMAN,Have you been crying?
S06E24,ELAINE,"Yes, (sob) you see this (sob) woman, this manicurist,"
S06E24,PETERMAN,"Oh no, that doesnt matter now. That's a very nice jacket."
S06E24,ELAINE,"Uh, (sob) thanks."
S06E24,PETERMAN,"Very soft, huge button flaps, cargo pockets, draw string waist, deep biswing vents in the back perfect for jumping into a gondola."
S06E24,ELAINE,How do you know all that?
S06E24,PETERMAN,That's my coat.
S06E24,ELAINE,You mean..?
S06E24,PETERMAN,"Yes, I'm J. Peterman."
S06E24,ELAINE,Oh!
S06E24,JERRY,"I don't know why I have to go to the hospital. I didn't do anything to Bette Midler. Driver can you stop over here, we're picking somebody up."
S06E24,GENNICE,"Hey, I didn't do anything. I was never informed.  YOU CAN ALL GO STRAIGHT TO HELL. You see that? You see what I am going through?"
S06E24,GEORGE,So what? Somebody dropped an egg on my head as I went into my building last night.
S06E24,JERRY,"Hey, I'm being heckled on stage. People are yelling out Galloogy."
S06E24,GENNICE,I'm having a little trouble with all this. I mean all I ever wanted to do is sing. Now I'm the focus of this big media frenzy. (sob) Nobody in the show will even talk to me.
S06E24,JERRY,Stop your crying will ya?
S06E24,GENNICE,What?
S06E24,GEORGE,You heard him.
S06E24,GENNICE,"Oh, don't you you're the reason this whole thing happened."
S06E24,GEORGE,"Oh, yeah. I read what you said to the papers yesterday. You weren't in on the planing. What planning? YOU THINK WE PLANED THIS? Uh?"
S06E24,CABBIE,Wait. Wait. I know you. You knocked Bette Midler out of Rochelle Rochelle the Musical. I want you creeps out of my cab.
S06E24,JERRY,"Hey, I had nothing to do with it."
S06E24,CABBIE,"Get out of my cab. You should go to prison. You should be in prison for the rest of your life. Get out, each of you. Each and every one of you get out of my cab."
S06E24,PETERMAN,Then in the distance I heard the bulls. I began running as fast as I could. Fortunately I was wearing my Italian Captoe Oxfords. Sophisticated yet different; nothing to make a huge fuss about. Rich dark brown calfskin leather. Matching leather vent. Men's whole and half sizes 7 through 13. Price $135.00.
S06E24,ELAINE,"Oh, that's not too expensive."
S06E24,PETERMAN,That shirt. Where did you get it?
S06E24,ELAINE,"Oh, this innocent looking shirt has something which isn't innocent at all. Touchability! Heavy, silky Italian cotton, with a fine almost terrycloth like feeling. Five button placket, relaxed fit, innocence and mayhem at once."
S06E24,PETERMAN,That's NOT bad!
S06E24,KIM,"Oh, Frank. So many years. If only you had taken your shoes off."
S06E24,FRANK,I couldn't because I had a potential foot problem.
S06E24,KIM,I thought maybe you had a hole in your socks.
S06E24,FRANK,I wiped them for two minutes on the mat. I don't know why your father had to make a federal case out of it.
S06E24,KIM,Anyway that is all in the past. We have our whole future ahead of us.
S06E24,FRANK,Between you and me I think your country is placing a lot of importance on shoe removal.
S06E24,KIM,You short stop me? We don't do that in Korea! Take me home. Inever want to see you again.
S06E24,KRAMER,"Hi, here. I made this for your. (gives her a pasta statue)"
S06E24,BETTE,What is it?
S06E24,KRAMER,It's macaroni Midler.
S06E24,BETTE,Macaroni Midler?
S06E24,KRAMER,"Yeah, see how you're singing?"
S06E24,BETTE,yeah ha ha. Well you made a long journey from Milan to Minsk.
S06E24,KRAMER,"oh, what's that from?"
S06E24,BETTE,"Oh, that's one of the songs from my show. Bette sings"
S06E24,KRAMER,Oh You are so freaking talented.
S06E24,KRAMER,"Oh, so look who's here. What do you want."
S06E24,JERRY,We just want to talk to her. We want to apologize and tell her the whole thing was an accident.
S06E24,KRAMER,"No, no. I'm sorry it's out of the question."
S06E24,JERRY,What?
S06E24,KRAMER,Bette is recuperating right now and I'm not going to allow anything to disturb her.
S06E24,GEORGE,Who are you to decide?
S06E24,KRAMER,I'm calling the shots around here so there won't be anymore ACCIDENTS!
S06E24,GEORGE,"Hey, look, Kramer,"
S06E24,KRAMER,AH! I don't want her disturbed.
S06E24,RUBY,"hello, Elaine."
S06E24,ELAINE,Hello
S06E24,LOTUS,We're so excited.
S06E24,ELAINE,You're welcome.
S06E24,RUBY,We'll see you inside.
S06E24,JERRY,What happened?
S06E24,ELAINE,"Well I felt bad about the spying, so you know, ,I got them tickets to the show."
S06E24,JERRY,"Oh,, that's nice. Alright, I'll see you later."
S06E24,ELAINE,"Wait, wait. I didn't get to tell you about my new job."
S06E24,JERRY,Where?
S06E24,ELAINE,Writing for the J. Peterman catalogue.
S06E24,JERRY,(pushing her) How did you get that?
S06E24,ELAINE,I met him.
S06E24,JERRY,You met J. Peterman?
S06E24,ELAINE,yeah.
S06E24,JERRY,What is he like?
S06E24,ELAINE,"He wore a classic courtman's duster. beige corduroy collar, 100% cotton canvas, high waist, nine pockets, six on the outside, great for running along side a train, (Jerry walking away) waving last goodbyes, posing on a veranda, Men's sizes ..."
S06E24,JERRY,"(walking away) Yeah, I'll see ya'."
S06E24,ELAINE,". . . Small, Medium, Large, XL, Double..."
S06E24,JERRY,"Well, break a leg tonight."
S06E24,GENNICE,I'm really nervous.
S06E24,STAGEHAND,"Here you got a telegram. Well, look who's here."
S06E24,JERRY,"Listen buddy,"
S06E24,STAGEHAND,What are you going to do? Break my legs? You don't scare me. You or your goons.
S06E24,GENNICE,How do you like this?
S06E24,JERRY,What is it?
S06E24,GENNICE,My grandmother died.
S06E24,JERRY,"Oh, I'm so sorry."
S06E24,GENNICE,"Oh, it's okay,"
S06E24,JERRY,So you don't cry when your grandmother dies? But a hotdog makes you lose control?
S06E24,VOICE,(Off camera) Places everyone.
S06E24,GENNICE,I gotta go.
S06E24,JERRY,Good luck.
S06E24,ANNOUNCER,ladies and gentlemen for this evening's performance the part of Rochelle will be played by Gennice Grant.
S06E24,LOTUS,Gennice Glant?
S06E24,RUBY,What happened to Bette Midler?
S06E24,ELAINE,"Oh, she got hurt."
S06E24,RUBY,No Bette Midler? (they talk Korean and all three leave)
S06E24,ELAINE,"I, uh, wait,"
S06E24,GENNICE,"(singing and dancing) ""It's a long journey from Milan to Minsk"" (Shoe lace comes undone (even LOOKS like figure skates) wait wait. Hold it stop, (sob) I'm sorry, I have to start it over, my shoelace. (sob) I can't do it like this. Please let me start over. (sob) Please. (sob) Please. . . ."
S07E01,GEORGE,"Well, you got no place to go. I'll tell you what your problem is You brought your queen out too fast. What do you think? She's one of these feminists looking to get out of the house? No, the queen is old fashioned. . Likes to stay home. Cook. Take care of her man. Make sure he feels good."
S07E01,LIZ,Checkmate.
S07E01,GEORGE,I don't think we should see each other any more.
S07E01,ELAINE,Shut up! Shut up! You stupid mutt.
S07E01,JERRY,And you broke up with her 'cuz she beat you at chess? That's pretty sick.
S07E01,GEORGE,"I don't see how I could perform sexually in a situation after something like that. I was completely emasculated. Anyway, it's not the only reason."
S07E01,JERRY,"Yeah, what else?"
S07E01,GEORGE,"All right. You wanna know what one of her favorite expressions is? Happy, Pappy?"
S07E01,JERRY,"Happy, Pappy? What does that mean?"
S07E01,GEORGE,"Like if she wants to know if I'm pleased with something, she'll say, ""Happy, Pappy?"""
S07E01,JERRY,"Oh, you're ""Pappy""."
S07E01,GEORGE,"I'm ""Pappy""."
S07E01,JERRY,"Oh, I get it. Why don't you just say it?"
S07E01,GEORGE,"Oh, come on. What, are you kidding? GEORGE I'm much more comfortable criticizing people behind there backs. Anyway, look who's talking. You just broke up with with Melanie last week because she ""shuushed you"" while you were watching TV."
S07E01,JERRY,"Hey, I got a real thing about ""shushing""!"
S07E01,GEORGE,What is this? Did you ever get the feeling like you've had a haircut but you didn't have one? I'm all itchy back here.
S07E01,JERRY,Ahh.
S07E01,GEORGE,What?
S07E01,JERRY,What is this? What are we doing? What in god's name are we doing?
S07E01,GEORGE,What?
S07E01,JERRY,OUR LIVES!! . What kind of lives are these? We're like children. We're not men.
S07E01,GEORGE,"No, we're not. We're not men."
S07E01,JERRY,We come up with all these stupid reasons to break up with these women.
S07E01,GEORGE,I know. I know. That's what I do. That's what I do.
S07E01,JERRY,Are we going to be sitting here when we're sixty like two idiots?
S07E01,GEORGE,. We should be having dinner with our sons when we're sixty.
S07E01,JERRY,We're pathetic you know that?
S07E01,GEORGE,"Yeah, Like I don't know that I'm pathetic."
S07E01,JERRY,Why can't I be normal?
S07E01,GEORGE,"Yes. Me, too. I wanna be normal. Normal."
S07E01,JERRY,It would be nice to care about someone.
S07E01,GEORGE,Yes. Yes. Care. You know who I think about a lot? Remember SUSAN ? The one that used to work for NBC?
S07E01,JERRY,Hmm. I thought she became a lesbian.
S07E01,GEORGE,No. It didn't take.
S07E01,JERRY,Oh.
S07E01,GEORGE,"Did I tell you I ran into her last week? Ho-ho, she looked great."
S07E01,JERRY,Hmm.
S07E01,GEORGE,"You thought she was good looking, right?"
S07E01,JERRY,"See, there you go again. What is the difference what I think?"
S07E01,GEORGE,I was just curious.
S07E01,JERRY,"Well, this is it. I'm really gonna do something about my life, you know? You know, I think I'm gonna call Melanie again. So what if she shushed me. GEORGE, I am really gonna make some changes."
S07E01,GEORGE,Yes. Changes.
S07E01,JERRY,I'm serious about it.
S07E01,GEORGE,Think I'M not?
S07E01,JERRY,I'm not kidding.
S07E01,GEORGE,"Me, too."
S07E01,[At JERRY,'s. He's on the phone]
S07E01,JERRY,"Melanie, you can shush me at every opportunity. 5? 3? Oh, it was just an expression. All right, well, that's very sweet of you. Okay, I'll call you later. All right, bye. Hey!"
S07E01,KRAMER,What?
S07E01,JERRY,I had a very interesting lunch with GEORGE Costanza today.
S07E01,KRAMER,Really?
S07E01,JERRY,We were talking about our lives and we both kind of realized we're kids. We're not men.
S07E01,KRAMER,"So, then you asked yourselves, ""Isn't there something more to life?"""
S07E01,JERRY,Yes. We did.
S07E01,KRAMER,"Yeah, well, let me clue you in on something. There isn't."
S07E01,JERRY,There isn't?
S07E01,KRAMER,"Absolutely not. I mean, what are you thinking about, JERRY? Marriage? Family?"
S07E01,JERRY,Well...
S07E01,KRAMER,They're prisons. Man made prisons. You're doing time. You get up in the morning. She's there. You go to sleep at night. She's there. It's like you gotta ask permission to use the bathroom. Is it all right if I use the bathroom now?
S07E01,JERRY,Really?
S07E01,KRAMER,"Yeah, and you can forget about watching TV while you're eating."
S07E01,JERRY,I can?
S07E01,KRAMER,"Oh, yeah. You know why? Because it's dinner time. And you know what you do at dinner?"
S07E01,JERRY,What?
S07E01,KRAMER,"You talk about your day. How was your day today? Did you have a good day today or a bad day today? Well, what kind of day was it? Well, I don't know. How about you? How was your day?"
S07E01,JERRY,Boy.
S07E01,KRAMER,"It's sad , Jerry. It's a sad state of affairs.."
S07E01,JERRY,I'm glad we had this talk.
S07E01,KRAMER,"Oh, you have no idea."
S07E01,GEORGE,La-la-la...
S07E01,KRAMER,Hey.
S07E01,JERRY,Hey.
S07E01,ELAINE,Three hours of sleep again last night.. Three hours of sleep because of that dog.
S07E01,KRAMER,What dog?
S07E01,KRAMER,Yeah. What dog?
S07E01,ELAINE,This dog in the courtyard across from my bedroom window that never never stops barking..
S07E01,KRAMER,Don't...
S07E01,ELAINE,"I lost my voice screaming at this thing. I can't sleep. I can't work. I mean, I just moved. I can't move again. What am I gonna do? What? What am I gonna do?"
S07E01,KRAMER,"Well, there is something you can do."
S07E01,ELAINE,"What? KRAMER, I'll do anything."
S07E01,KRAMER,"Well, what if there should be an unfortunate accident?"
S07E01,JERRY,You're going to rub out the dog?
S07E01,KRAMER,"No, no. Not me. I just happen to know someone who specializes in exactely these kinds of sticky situations."
S07E01,ELAINE,Uh-huh.
S07E01,JERRY,"What, you're considering this?"
S07E01,KRAMER,"Look, just meet with him. ?????."
S07E01,ELAINE,"I don't really know why I'm here. Kramer talked me into coming up here. But, obviously, I could never really do anything."
S07E01,NEWMAN,Of course. Obviously.
S07E01,ELAINE,"Uh, so, anyway, I'm sorry for wasting your time."
S07E01,NEWMAN,What kind of dog did you say it was?
S07E01,ELAINE,"Um, I don't know. I've never really seen it."
S07E01,NEWMAN,I see many dogs on my mail route. I'll bet there's not one type of mutt or mongrel I haven't run across.
S07E01,NEWMAN,"If you ask me, they have no business living amongst us. Vile, USELESS BEASTS . . ."
S07E01,KRAMER,NEWMAN ! Stop it!!
S07E01,NEWMAN,Anyway.
S07E01,ELAINE,"Yeah. Well um, I was just curious if I were interested in availing myself of your services, um, what exactly would you do?"
S07E01,NEWMAN,"Well, ELAINE, There's any number of things I could do. But, I can promise you this, though, this vicious beast will never bother you again. So, what's it going to be?"
S07E01,ELAINE,"No, I'm sorry. I can't hurt a dog. I can't hurt a dog. I can't."
S07E01,KRAMER,I got it. We'll kidnap him . and we'll drop him off Upstate and this way he won't bother you anymore and he won't get hurt.
S07E01,NEWMAN,"Yeah, I suppose."
S07E01,KRAMER,Huh?
S07E01,ELAINE,"I'd have to think about it. I doubt it, though. I doubt it. I'll let you know."
S07E01,NEWMAN,Of course. Take your time. I be here.
S07E01,[GEORGE,is still at the pier. His thoughts shift somewhat.]
S07E01,GEORGE,La-la-la-la-la-la-la! [flashbacks to Susan]
S07E01,ELAINE,All right. Let's do it.
S07E01,NEWMAN,Excellent. Excellent.
S07E01,JERRY,How come you're eating your peas one at a time?
S07E01,MELANIE,I'm sorry.
S07E01,SUSAN,Who is it?
S07E01,GEORGE,It's GEORGE.
S07E01,SUSAN,"GEORGE? GEORGE, what is it?"
S07E01,GEORGE,Will you marry me?
S07E01,GEORGE,"Ma, guess what!"
S07E01,MRS. COSTANZA,"Oh, my god!"
S07E01,GEORGE,"No, it's nothing bad. I'm getting married."
S07E01,MRS. COSTANZA,You're what?
S07E01,GEORGE,I'm getting married?
S07E01,MRS. COSTANZA,"Oh, my god! You're getting married?"
S07E01,GEORGE,Yes!
S07E01,MRS. COSTANZA,"Oh, I can't believe it. FRANK, come here."
S07E01,FRANK,You come here.
S07E01,MRS. COSTANZA,Georgie's getting married.
S07E01,FRANK,What?
S07E01,MRS. COSTANZA,Georgie's getting married.
S07E01,FRANK,Get the hell out of here. He's getting married?
S07E01,MRS. COSTANZA,Yes.
S07E01,FRANK,To a woman?
S07E01,MRS. COSTANZA,Of course to a woman. What's she look like?
S07E01,FRANK,I'm sure she's pretty gorgeous.
S07E01,GEORGE,What difference does it make what she looks like?
S07E01,MRS. COSTANZA,Is she pretty?
S07E01,GEORGE,"Yes, she's pretty. What difference does it make?"
S07E01,MRS. COSTANZA,"Oh, I'm just curious."
S07E01,FRANK,She's not pretty?
S07E01,MRS. COSTANZA,Let me talk to her.
S07E01,GEORGE,She wants to talk to you.
S07E01,SUSAN,"Uh, hello?"
S07E01,MRS. COSTANZA,Congratulations!
S07E01,SUSAN,I just want you to know that I love your son very much.
S07E01,MRS. COSTANZA,You do?
S07E01,SUSAN,Yes.
S07E01,MRS. COSTANZA,Really?
S07E01,SUSAN,Yes.
S07E01,MRS. COSTANZA,May I ask why?
S07E01,FRANK,Okay...
S07E01,MRS. COSTANZA,Will you stop. I'm on the telephone.
S07E01,FRANK,"Can I talk to her, please?"
S07E01,JERRY,Hey!
S07E01,KRAMER,Hey!
S07E01,JERRY,What are you up to?
S07E01,KRAMER,Nothing.
S07E01,JERRY,What's the rope for?
S07E01,KRAMER,"Oh! Well, How do you like that. I got rope. Um, I gotta go."
S07E01,JERRY,The dog. You're getting the dog.
S07E01,GEORGE,"Hey, Kramer, where are you going?"
S07E01,KRAMER,Out.
S07E01,GEORGE,"Don't go. Kramer! Come back. I got great news. Well, I did it."
S07E01,JERRY,Did what?
S07E01,GEORGE,I got engaged. I'm getting married. I asked Susan to marry me. We're getting married this Christmas.
S07E01,JERRY,You're getting married?
S07E01,GEORGE,Yes!
S07E01,JERRY,"Oh, my god!"
S07E01,GEORGE,"I'm a man. Jerry, I'm a man. And do you know why? It's because of that talk we had. You were my inspiration. Do you believe it? You. That lunch was the defining moment of my life."
S07E01,JERRY,I'm blown away.
S07E01,GEORGE,You're blown?
S07E01,JERRY,Wow!
S07E01,GEORGE,You like that?
S07E01,JERRY,"And she said ""Yes""?"
S07E01,GEORGE,"It took a couple of hours of convincing. I was persistent. I was just like those guys in the movies. And it worked! She said ""Yes""! I can't believe my luck that she was still available . A beautiful woman like that. You think she's good looking, right?"
S07E01,JERRY,You're gonna have gorgeous kids.
S07E01,GEORGE,Yes. She's got great skin - a rosy glow..
S07E01,JERRY,Pinkish hue?
S07E01,GEORGE,"Oh, she's got the hue. So, what's going on with you and Melanie? I mean, I know you're not getting married, but uh, things are happening?"
S07E01,JERRY,"Well...actually, we kind of broke up."
S07E01,GEORGE,You what?
S07E01,JERRY,"Well, you know, we were having dinner the other night, and she's got this strangest habit. She eats her peas one at a time. You've never seen anything like it. It takes her an hour to finish them. I mean, we've had dinner other times. I've seen her eat Corn Niblets. But she scooped them."
S07E01,GEORGE,. . . she scooped her niblets?
S07E01,JERRY,Yes. That's what was so vexing.
S07E01,GEORGE,Uh-huh. Uh-huh. What about the pact?
S07E01,JERRY,What?
S07E01,GEORGE,What happened to the pact? We were both gonna change. We shook hands on a pact. Did you not shake my hand on it uh?
S07E01,JERRY,"You stuck your hand out, so I shook it. I don't know about a pact. Anyway, you should be happy you're engaged. You're getting married."
S07E01,GEORGE,"Well, it's not that. I just, you know, I thought that we were both uh..."
S07E01,JERRY,You thought I was gonna get married?
S07E01,GEORGE,"Well, maybe not married, but..."
S07E01,JERRY,"I mean, you love Susan, right?"
S07E01,GEORGE,Yeah.
S07E01,JERRY,You want to spend the rest of your life with her
S07E01,GEORGE,. . . . . . Yeah.
S07E01,JERRY,So?
S07E01,GEORGE,Yeah. It doesn't make any difference.
S07E01,JERRY,"No. So, we're still on to see uh, Firestorm tonight?"
S07E01,GEORGE,Yeah.
S07E01,JERRY,I'll pick you up at your apartment. We'll go to the Eight.
S07E01,GEORGE,Yeah.
S07E01,JERRY,"Hey, wait a second. Wait a second. ! Celebrate! How about some champagne?"
S07E01,GEORGE,Champagne?
S07E01,JERRY,"Yes, come on! How often do you get engaged? Come on!"
S07E01,GEORGE,Okay! Alright!
S07E01,JERRY,You know what? No champagne. Anyway. . . I'll see you later.
S07E01,GEORGE,Yeah.
S07E01,ELAINE,That's it. That's it. Stop right here.
S07E01,NEWMAN,"All right, give me the rope."
S07E01,ELAINE,What? What do you need a rope for?
S07E01,NEWMAN,"Look, I don't have time to explain every little thing to you."
S07E01,ELAINE,"I don't know. Now, I'm thinking maybe we shouldn't do this."
S07E01,NEWMAN,I knew you'd back out.
S07E01,ELAINE,"KRAMER, are we doing a bad thing?"
S07E01,KRAMER,"Well, Look at it this way. We drop the dog off in front of somebody's house in the country. They find it and adopt it. Now the dog is prancing in the fields. Dancing and prancing. Fresh air. . Dandelions. We're doing this dog a huge favor."
S07E01,ELAINE,Yeah. That's him.
S07E01,NEWMAN,All right. I'm going in. Keep the motor running.
S07E01,JERRY,Ready?
S07E01,GEORGE,"Um, I don't uh, really think I can go."
S07E01,JERRY,"Oh, how come?"
S07E01,GEORGE,"Well, I didn't really tell Susan about it, and she doesn't really have anything else to do."
S07E01,JERRY,"Well, she could come."
S07E01,GEORGE,"Well, she doesn't really want to see Firestorm."
S07E01,JERRY,Oh.
S07E01,GEORGE,"She um, she wants to see The Muted Heart."
S07E01,JERRY,"Oh, The Muted Heart. Glen Close. Sally Field. Well, that should be good."
S07E01,GEORGE,Yeah. see you later.
S07E01,JERRY,"Hey, wait a second. You know, we could share a cab. They're playing at the same Cineplex."
S07E01,SUSAN,"George, better get ready."
S07E01,GEORGE,I am ready.
S07E01,SUSAN,You wearing that shirt?.
S07E01,GEORGE,"Okay, I guess I'll see you down there."
S07E01,JERRY,Yeah.
S07E01,GEORGE,Okay.
S07E01,ELAINE,What time you got?
S07E01,KRAMER,"Oh, no. I don't wear a watch."
S07E01,ELAINE,What do you do?
S07E01,KRAMER,"Well, I tell time by the sun."
S07E01,ELAINE,How close do you get?
S07E01,KRAMER,"Well, I can guess within an hour."
S07E01,ELAINE,"Tsk. Well, I can guess within the hour, and I don't even have to look at the sun."
S07E01,KRAMER,Yeah.
S07E01,ELAINE,"Well, what about at night? What do you do then?"
S07E01,KRAMER,"Well, night's tougher but it's only a couple of hours."
S07E01,NEWMAN,Let's go. Let's go. Move!
S07E01,KRAMER,You got it?
S07E01,NEWMAN,What do you think? Drive. Drive.
S07E01,ELAINE,Where is it? Where is it? This? This is the dog?
S07E01,NEWMAN,Yep.
S07E01,ELAINE,But he's so small.
S07E01,NEWMAN,"Yeah, but he's a fighter."
S07E01,ELAINE,That can't be the dog. Are you sure you got the right one?
S07E01,NEWMAN,"Look, you said the one in the second courtyard. He was in the second courtyard."
S07E01,ELAINE,How could that be the dog?
S07E01,KRAMER,"Well, get him to bark."
S07E01,ELAINE,Yeah. Yeah. I'll know if he barks.
S07E01,NEWMAN,All right. Bark.
S07E01,ELAINE,Bark.
S07E01,NEWMAN,Bark.
S07E01,SUSAN,Did you like it?
S07E01,GEORGE,"Yes, it was very, very good."
S07E01,SUSAN,"Oh, do you think he'll ever find her again?"
S07E01,GEORGE,"Oh, I sure hope so."
S07E01,JERRY,"How about when Harrison Ford jumped out of that plane, and he was shooting back at them as he was falling?"
S07E01,FRIEND,What about that underwater escape?
S07E01,JERRY,"Oh, man!"
S07E01,KRAMER,Let's turn the radio on. Maybe there's a news report about it.
S07E01,NEWMAN,???????
S07E01,ELAINE,You think we're far enough.
S07E01,NEWMAN,We're practically to Monticello.
S07E01,KRAMER,"Yeah. This looks right. All right. Give me the dog. Okay, boy. This is it. This is your new home. Let go of my shirt. Come on. Let go of my shirt. This shirt is from Rudy's."
S07E01,GEORGE,Hello?
S07E01,JERRY,"Hey, ??? is rerunning the Yankee game. You watching this?"
S07E01,GEORGE,They are?
S07E01,SUSAN,"GEORGE, you coming to bed? I'm taping Mad About You."
S07E01,GEORGE,"Uh, yeah, I'll be there in a minute."
S07E01,JERRY,What was that?
S07E01,GEORGE,"Uh, nothing. I got to go."
S07E01,JERRY,"Oh, Mattingly just singled ."
S07E01,GEORGE,"You know, it was really wrong of you to back out on that deal."
S07E01,JERRY,I didn't make a deal. I just shook your hand.
S07E01,GEORGE,"Yeah, Well that's a deal where I come from."
S07E01,JERRY,We come from the same place.
S07E01,SUSAN,"GEORGE, I'm starting it."
S07E01,GEORGE,I got to go.
S07E01,LADY,Roxy! Where have you been? We've been worried sick about you. What's this? Hmm. Rudy's.
S07E01,ELAINE,No! No! It's impossible. It's impossible.
S07E01,ELAINE,"I don't know. I don't know how it happened. We were practically in Monticello. I mean, how could that thing have found its way back? There's no way."
S07E01,JERRY,Very strange.
S07E01,ELAINE,I know.
S07E01,JERRY,"So, tell me anyway. Who was the BIG mastermind?"
S07E01,ELAINE,"Oh, I can't Jerry. 4I'm sworn to secrecy."
S07E01,JERRY,All right. But then I can't tell you the BIG news.
S07E01,ELAINE,News? What news?
S07E01,JERRY,Sorry!
S07E01,ELAINE,What? What?
S07E01,JERRY,"All right, Elaine but this is beyond news. This is like Pearl Harbor. Or the Kennedy assassination. It's like not even news. It's total shock."
S07E01,ELAINE,"Oh, come on, Jerry. Please, please, please, please, please!"
S07E01,JERRY,George Costanza...
S07E01,ELAINE,Yeah?
S07E01,JERRY,Is getting married!
S07E01,ELAINE,Get out!
S07E01,KRAMER,Hi.
S07E01,COP,You Cosmo Kramer?
S07E01,KRAMER,"Uh, yes. Yeah."
S07E01,COP,You recognize this piece of fabric?
S07E01,KRAMER,"Oh, yeah, that's..."
S07E01,COP,What?
S07E01,KRAMER,What?
S07E01,COP,You're under arrest.
S07E01,KRAMER,Arrest?
S07E01,COP,I have a receipt for a rental car with your signature. Including a report with some damage to the rear seat. It seems the spring was so compressed it completely collapsed the right side..
S07E01,JERRY,Newman.
S07E01,NEWMAN,What took you so long?
S07E01,KRAMER,"Hey, what do you think they'll do to us?"
S07E01,NEWMAN,"Ah, don't worry about a thing. In twenty minutes that place'll be swarming with mailmen. We'll be back on the street by lunch."
S07E01,ELAINE,I gotta make some changes. I'm not a woman. I'm a child. What kind of life is this?
S07E02,ELAINE,"Hey, good news. My dog problem has been solved."
S07E02,JERRY,Really? What happened?
S07E02,ELAINE,"Well, there's this rabbi in my building. You've met him. Very nice man."
S07E02,JERRY,Isn't he the one with the show on cable?
S07E02,ELAINE,"Yea, yeah, yeah,. So I spoke to him about the dog. He went down. Talked to the owner. She agr4eed to keep the dog inside from now on."
S07E02,JERRY,That's great.
S07E02,ELAINE,I know.
S07E02,JERRY,That looks pretty good.
S07E02,ELAINE,He's in.
S07E02,JERRY,"Hey, say, you know, we haven't even discussed George's engagement yet."
S07E02,ELAINE,What's to discuss?
S07E02,JERRY,Come on! GEORGE is getting married!
S07E02,ELAINE,Is he happy?
S07E02,[At the restaurant! GEORGE,is coming from the bathroom to sit with his bride-to-be.]
S07E02,GEORGE,I will never understand the bathrooms in this country. Why is it that the doors on the stalls do not come all the way down to the floor?
S07E02,SUSAN,"Well, maybe it's so you can see if there's someone in there."
S07E02,GEORGE,Isn't that why we have locks on the doors?
S07E02,SUSAN,"Well, as a backup system, in case the lock is broken, you can see if it's taken."
S07E02,GEORGE,A backup system? We're designing bathroom doors with our legs exposed in anticipation of the locks not working? That's not a system. That's a complete breakdown of the system.
S07E02,SUSAN,"Can we change the subject, please?"
S07E02,GEORGE,Why? What's wrong with the subject? This is a bad subject?
S07E02,SUSAN,"No, fine. If you wanna keep talking about it, we'll talk about it."
S07E02,GEORGE,It's not that I want to keep talking about it? just think that the subject should resolve itself based on its own momentum.
S07E02,SUSAN,"Well, I didn't think that it had any momentum."
S07E02,GEORGE,(To himself) How am I gonna do this? I'm engaged to this woman? She doesn't even like me. Change the subject? Toilets were the subject. We don't even share the same interests.
S07E02,JERRY,"Yeah, he seems pretty happy."
S07E02,ELAINE,"Well, that's all that counts, I guess."
S07E02,JERRY,What's the matter?
S07E02,ELAINE,"Oh, nothin'."
S07E02,JERRY,"Well, you don't seem too enthused about the whole thing."
S07E02,ELAINE,"Well, what do you want me to do?"
S07E02,JERRY,"Well, at least have some reaction to it."
S07E02,ELAINE,"Well, I don't."
S07E02,JERRY,Maybe you're a little jealous.
S07E02,ELAINE,"Oh, what? You think I wanna marry George?"
S07E02,JERRY,"No! But maybe you wish it was you who was getting married, not him."
S07E02,ELAINE,"Oh, please! That is the last thing that I want."
S07E02,JERRY,"Oh, yeah. Right."
S07E02,ELAINE,"Yeah, right."
S07E02,JERRY,Lainy!
S07E02,ELAINE,Jerry!
S07E02,JERRY,You don't wanna get married?
S07E02,ELAINE,"Yeah, that's right. I don't wanna get married."
S07E02,JERRY,"Oh, come on!"
S07E02,ELAINE,"Oh, you come on."
S07E02,JERRY,You're such...
S07E02,KRAMER,"Oh, hey!"
S07E02,JERRY,Hey.
S07E02,KRAMER,"Elaine, listen, I was talking to a friend about this dog business. Do you realize this is gonna be on our permanent records? Are you aware of this?"
S07E02,ELAINE,"Oh, dear."
S07E02,KRAMER,"It can never be erased. It'll follow us wherever we go for the rest of our lives. I'll never be able to get a job. I mean, doesn't that concern you? Everything I've worked for...down the drain because of one stupid mistake. I mean, aren't we entitled to make one mistake in our lives, Jerry?"
S07E02,JERRY,We're gonna change the system.
S07E02,KRAMER,Yes!
S07E02,ELAINE,"Well, I could care less. I hope it is on our record. I'm just sorry they didn't lock me up."
S07E02,ELAINE,"Oh, hello, Rabbi Krischma."
S07E02,RABBI,ELAINE! Always a pleasure to see you.
S07E02,ELAINE,Thanks again for taking care of that dog for us.
S07E02,RABBI,"Elaine, often times in life there are problems, and just as often there are solutions."
S07E02,ELAINE,"Yeah, I suppose."
S07E02,RABBI,"Elaine, you don't seem yourself today. You seem, if I may say, troubled."
S07E02,ELAINE,"No, Rabbi, I'm not myself."
S07E02,RABBI,Come upstairs. We'll have a talk.
S07E02,JERRY,Hey!
S07E02,GEORGE,I want your honest opinion about something.
S07E02,JERRY,Have I ever been less than forthright?
S07E02,GEORGE,"No, you haven't. Well, maybe you have. What do I know."
S07E02,JERRY,"Yeah, I probably have. Yeah, of course I have. What am I talking about?"
S07E02,GEORGE,"All right. Okay, tell me what you think about this idea Extend the doors on the toilet stalls at Yankee Stadium all the way to the floor."
S07E02,JERRY,Extend the doors on the toilet stalls at Yankee Stadium to the floor ...door comes down. Hides your feet. Yes. I like it. I like it a lot.
S07E02,GEORGE,"It's good, right?"
S07E02,JERRY,I think it's fantastic. I think it's a fantastic idea.
S07E02,GEORGE,You do?
S07E02,JERRY,"Yes, I do."
S07E02,GEORGE,"Well, I told it to Susan before, and she didn't like it."
S07E02,JERRY,Hmm.
S07E02,GEORGE,"Yeah. Not only that, this is what she said to me, ""Can we change the subject?"""
S07E02,JERRY,"See, now that I don't care for."
S07E02,GEORGE,"Right. I mean, we're on a subject. Why does it have to be changed?"
S07E02,JERRY,It should resolve of its own volition.
S07E02,GEORGE,"That's exactly what I said, except I used the word ""momentum""."
S07E02,JERRY,Momentum - same thing.
S07E02,GEORGE,"Same thing. My god, I'm getting married in December, do you know that?"
S07E02,JERRY,"Yeah, I know."
S07E02,GEORGE,"Well, I don't see how I'm gonna make December. I mean, I need a little more time. I mean, look at me I'm a nervous wreck. My stomach aches. My neck is killing me. I can't turn. Look. Look."
S07E02,JERRY,You're turning.
S07E02,GEORGE,"Nah, it's not a good turn. December. December. Don't you think we should have a little more time just to get to know each other a little."
S07E02,JERRY,"If you need more time, you should have more time."
S07E02,GEORGE,"What, you think I could postpone it?"
S07E02,JERRY,Sure you can. Why not?
S07E02,GEORGE,That's allowed? You're allowed to postpone it?
S07E02,JERRY,I don't see why not.
S07E02,GEORGE,"So, I could do that?"
S07E02,JERRY,"Sure, go ahead."
S07E02,GEORGE,"All right! All right. I'll tell you what. How about this? Got the date; March 21st, the first day of spring."
S07E02,JERRY,Spring. Of course.
S07E02,GEORGE,Huh? You know? Spring. Rejuvenation. Rebirth. Everything's blooming. All that crap.
S07E02,JERRY,Beautiful.
S07E02,GEORGE,She's not gonna like it.
S07E02,JERRY,"No, she's not."
S07E02,GEORGE,"You know, I think I'm a little bit scared of her. She's five-three, like a hundred pounds. I'm frightened to death of her."
S07E02,JERRY,"Well, she's a woman. They don't like to be disappointed."
S07E02,GEORGE,"Especially her. She does not like disappointment. Well, I have to do it. I can't make December. There's no way I can make December. Right? I mean, you can see that, right? I mean, look at me. Look. Look. Can I make December? I can't make December. Right? Look. Look."
S07E02,JERRY,"Yeah, you'd better shoot for March."
S07E02,KRAMER,"Hey, hey."
S07E02,GEORGE,"March 21st. Hey! So, you're gonna back me on this, right?"
S07E02,JERRY,"Oh, all the way."
S07E02,GEORGE,You are a good friend. You know what? Even if you killed somebody I wouldn't turn you in.
S07E02,JERRY,Is that so?
S07E02,JERRY,"Hey, Kramer if I killed somebody would you turn me in?"
S07E02,KRAMER,Definitely.
S07E02,JERRY,You're kidding?
S07E02,KRAMER,"No, no, I would turn you in."
S07E02,JERRY,You would turn me in?
S07E02,KRAMER,"Phwap, I wouldn't even think about it."
S07E02,JERRY,I can't believe your a friend of mine.
S07E02,KRAMER,What kind of person are you going around killing people?
S07E02,JERRY,"Well, I am sure I had a good reason."
S07E02,KRAMER,"Well,, if you'll kill this person, who's to say I wouldn't be next?"
S07E02,JERRY,But you know me!
S07E02,KRAMER,I thought I DID!
S07E02,ELAINE,I'm not a very religious person but I do feel as if I'm in need of some guidance here.
S07E02,RABBI,Would you care for a snack of some kind? I have the Snackwells which are very popular but I think that sometimes with the so called fat free cookies people may overindulge forgetting they may be high in calories
S07E02,ELAINE,"Thank you I am not very hungry. Anyway, um, this friend of mine, George, got engaged ."
S07E02,RABBI,How wonderful.
S07E02,ELAINE,"Yeah, yeah, well, for some reason, um, I just find myself just overcome with feelings of jealousy and resentment."
S07E02,RABBI,Doesn't it give you any joy to see your friend enter into this holiest of unions?
S07E02,ELAINE,"No, no, no it doesn't. No joy no joy whatsoever. Just the whole think makes me . . sick."
S07E02,RABBI,"You know, Elaine, very often we cannot see the forest for the trees."
S07E02,ELAINE,"Yeah, I don't know what that means."
S07E02,RABBI,"Well, for example, say there's a forest, . . ."
S07E02,ELAINE,"You see the thing is we It should have been me. You know, I'm smart. I'm attractive."
S07E02,RABBI,You know my temple has many single functions.
S07E02,ELAINE,"No, no, it's okay."
S07E02,RABBI,My nephew Alex is someone who is also looking perhaps
S07E02,ELAINE,I don't think so.
S07E02,RABBI,He owns a flower store. Very successful.
S07E02,JERRY,So you're nothing but a stoolie. Admit it.
S07E02,KRAMER,"Hey, don't do the crime if you can't do the time."
S07E02,JERRY,Another Caf Latte?
S07E02,KRAMER,You better believe it.
S07E02,KRAMER,Since when are you so trendy?
S07E02,JERRY,"Hey, baby. I set the trends. Who do you think started this whole Caf Latte?"
S07E02,JERRY,I don't recall you drinking Caf Latte.
S07E02,KRAMER,I've been drinking Caf Latte since the fifth grade and I haven't looked back.
S07E02,JERRY,"Hey, Planet 9 From Outer Space is playing tomorrow night. One show only."
S07E02,KRAMER,I've always wanted to see this.
S07E02,JERRY,You know I was supposed to see this five years ago. I was in a Chinese restaurant with George and Elaine and got all screwed up trying to get a table and I missed it.
S07E02,KRAMER,"Well, yeah, lets do it uh?"
S07E02,JERRY,"Look at this Jerry, dropping paper on the ground. That's littering."
S07E02,JERRY,Maybe you better call the cops and turn me in.
S07E02,KRAMER,Maybe I will.
S07E02,GEORGE,"Hi,"
S07E02,SUSAN,How was your day?
S07E02,GEORGE,"Good, good day. How was your day?"
S07E02,SUSAN,Mine was okay. So what's goin' on?
S07E02,GEORGE,"Oh, nothin' much. I went over to jerry's, uh, talked to Jerry."
S07E02,SUSAN,"Oh, the Lowers want to get together with us on Friday night."
S07E02,GEORGE,"The Lowers, really?"
S07E02,SUSAN,You don't want to go?
S07E02,GEORGE,"No, I want to go."
S07E02,SUSAN,So what did Jerry have to say?
S07E02,GEORGE,"Oh, nothin' much, . . . talkin'. . . . Oh, oh, oh, did I have an unbelievable idea today!"
S07E02,SUSAN,"Oh, yeah, the toilets. You told me."
S07E02,GEORGE,"Yeah, ha ha, It's not the toilets, it's not the toilets. It's something else. Are you ready for this?"
S07E02,SUSAN,Yeah.
S07E02,GEORGE,"Okay, how about this? All right, we get married March 21st, the first day of Spring."
S07E02,SUSAN,What do you mean? You want to postpone the wedding?
S07E02,GEORGE,"No, no no it's not about postponing. I just think the first day of Spring is the perfect day to get married. You know, Spring! Rejuvenation! Rebirth! Everything is blooming all the"
S07E02,SUSAN,"If you don't want to marry me, George, just say so. (crying) Say so."
S07E02,GEORGE,"Still marry , still marry."
S07E02,SUSAN,You don't love me.
S07E02,GEORGE,Sstill love. Still love.
S07E02,SUSAN,My parents told me you were too neurotic and that I was making a mistake.
S07E02,GEORGE,"No no no, no mistake, no mistake. No, no , listen, we're going to get married over Christmas, I It doesn't make any difference to me. It's fine. Really."
S07E02,SUSAN,Are you sure?
S07E02,GEORGE,"Yeah, yeah, sure, Christmas. Snow. Santa. All that stuff."
S07E02,JERRY,Let me take a guess. She cried and you caved.
S07E02,GEORGE,How did you know that?
S07E02,JERRY,I live and breath my friend. . . . I live and breath.
S07E02,GEORGE,I got to tell you I felt terrible. I really thought she was going to collapse and kill herself.
S07E02,JERRY,"tes, it's very difficult. Few men have the constitution for it. That's why breakups take two or three tries. You gotta build up your immunity."
S07E02,GEORGE,You see those tears streaming down you don't know what to do. It was like she was on fire and I was trying to put her out.
S07E02,JERRY,"Well, at least you probably had some, uh, pretty good make-up sex after."
S07E02,GEORGE,I didn't have any sex.
S07E02,JERRY,You didn't have make-up sex? How could you not have make-up sex? I mean that's the best feature of the heavy relationship.
S07E02,GEORGE,I didn't have make-up sex.
S07E02,JERRY,In your situation the only sex you're going to have better than make-up sex is if you're dent to prison and you have a conjugal visit.
S07E02,GEORGE,"Yeah, conjugal visit sex. That is happening!"
S07E02,WOMAN,(crying)
S07E02,MAN,I can tell you're very upset but I'm sorry I'm not goin'
S07E02,GEORGE,Did you here that? I can't believe this he's eating his sandwich.
S07E02,MAN,Are you going to eat thoise fries?
S07E02,GEORGE,This is amazing. (George gets up to leave and shake's man's hand) Thank you. Thank you very much. . . . I'm going back in! . . . You'll feel better (to woman)
S07E02,JERRY,. . . Poor bastard.
S07E02,JERRY,"Good evening, Rabbi."
S07E02,RABBI,Good evening. And how does this evening find you?
S07E02,JERRY,"Well, Rabbi, well."
S07E02,RABBI,"I trust you are here to see your friend, Elaine."
S07E02,JERRY,"Yeah, that's right."
S07E02,RABBI,I hope she's feeling better.
S07E02,JERRY,What do you mean?
S07E02,RABBI,She didn't tell you?
S07E02,JERRY,No.
S07E02,RABBI,Well it seems the engagement of her ffriend George has left her feeling bitter and hostile.
S07E02,JERRY,is that so?
S07E02,RABBI,"Yes, in fact she told me that she wishes she was the one getting married."
S07E02,JERRY,Really?
S07E02,RABBI,She came off as pretty desperate.
S07E02,JERRY,I didn't know any of this.
S07E02,RABBI,Apparently she doesn't think much of this George fellow either. I recall the word loser peppered throughout her conversation.
S07E02,JERRY,"Hum, well it all comes as news to me."
S07E02,GEORGE,(enters) Hi.
S07E02,SUSAN,"Hi, how was your day?"
S07E02,GEORGE,"Good, good day. How was your day?"
S07E02,SUSAN,"Ah, it was okay. What's going on?"
S07E02,GEORGE,"Oh, nothing much. You know, I went over to Jerry's. Talked to Jerry. Um, could I talk to you for a minute?"
S07E02,SUSAN,"Yeah, sure."
S07E02,GEORGE,"You see this is the thing. . . . (crying) I just feel . . . mumble, cry, mumble, . . . I'm scared. You and I together, (cry)"
S07E02,SUSAN,"George, of course, of course it can wait until march if that is what you want."
S07E02,GEORGE,Yeah?
S07E02,SUSAN,"Oh, don't worry your head. Of course."
S07E02,GEORGE,All right. (smiles behind her back)
S07E02,ELAINE,I've got that magazine article for you.
S07E02,JERRY,You iknow I talked to the rabbi outside.
S07E02,ELAINE,Are you
S07E02,JERRY,Understand you had a little talk with him too.
S07E02,ELAINE,"Yeah, talked earlier."
S07E02,JERRY,"Yes I know, I know."
S07E02,ELAINE,. . . What does that mean?
S07E02,JERRY,"Nothing, nothing."
S07E02,ELAINE,He didn't mention . . .
S07E02,JERRY,Yes he did.
S07E02,ELAINE,He told you about our conversation?
S07E02,JERRY,We had quite a little chat.
S07E02,ELAINE,He told you about . . .
S07E02,JERRY,"Yes, about how you're very jealous of George. How you wished it was you who were getting married instead of him."
S07E02,ELAINE,He told you all that? How could he?
S07E02,JERRY,"It didn't take much prodding either, I must say."
S07E02,ELAINE,Can he do that?
S07E02,JERRY,He did it.
S07E02,ELAINE,But he's a Rabbi! How can a Rabbi have such a big mouth?
S07E02,JERRY,That's what's so fascinating.
S07E02,JERRY,You better finish your little caf latte there. They won't let you in with it.
S07E02,KRAMER,Why not?
S07E02,JERRY,Because they don't allow outside drinks into the movie.
S07E02,KRAMER,Well that's stupid
S07E02,JERRY,That's the rule.
S07E02,KRAMER,"Well, we'll just see if we can't get around that."
S07E02,RABBI,"Oh, Elaine. Come in. Come in. So nice to see you again."
S07E02,ELAINE,Yeah
S07E02,RABBI,Can I offere you some Kasha Varnishkas?
S07E02,ELAINE,"No, no. Listen, Rabbi, I'd like to ask you a question. Why, why did you tell my friend Jerry what I talked to you about?"
S07E02,RABBI,Was that a problem for you?
S07E02,ELAINE,"Of course it was a problem for me. . . . You didn't, you didn't tell anyone else about this, did you?"
S07E02,RABBI,"Well, let's see? I seem to recall a conversation with Mrs. Winston in 1F."
S07E02,ELAINE,Mrs. Winston?
S07E02,RABBI,"Yes, we were waiting for our mail to arrive and I happened to mention to her how you felt that it was never going ""to happen"" for you."
S07E02,ELAINE,What about Don Ramsey? You didn't mention anything to him did you?
S07E02,RABBI,Don Ramsey?
S07E02,ELAINE,"You know that tall really good looking guy, he lives on the fifth floor."
S07E02,RABBI,Oh him! Well this morning I found myself in the elevator with him
S07E02,ELAINE,"my god, you didn't."
S07E02,JERRY,"Excuse me, pardon me, excuse me"
S07E02,KRAMER,"Oh, yow, oow Ah!"
S07E02,USHER,"Hey, hey, what's going on? What just happened here?"
S07E02,KRAMER,Nothing Nothing.
S07E02,USHER,Whatya got? One of those Caf Latte's in your shirt?
S07E02,KRAMER,I don't have anything. Ask him.
S07E02,USHER,"All right, come on Coffee Boy, bring it out."
S07E02,KRAMER,What?!
S07E02,USHER,Here you go.
S07E02,KRAMER,Ow
S07E02,ELAINE,But the whole thing is a mess. He told everyone in the building. I met that cute guy on the fifth floor. I mean he could barely bring himself to nod.
S07E02,JERRY,"Elaine, if I could say a word here about Jewish people. That man in no way represents our ability to take in a nice piece of juicy gossip and keep it to ourselves."
S07E02,ELAINE,"You didn't say this to George, did you?"
S07E02,JERRY,"No, . . . about how you wish it was YOU who was getting married instead of him? Feelings of resentment, hostility?"
S07E02,ELAINE,"Yeah that! So, . . ."
S07E02,GEORGE,Hey oh.
S07E02,ELAINE,"GEORGIE! CONGRATULATIONS! Oh, my god. I haven't seen you since it happened. I'm so happy for you."
S07E02,GEORGE,"Alright, thanks a lot."
S07E02,ELAINE,"Oh, come on. You really, really deserve it."
S07E02,GEORGE,"Oh, deserve! I don't know if I deserve...I mean..."
S07E02,ELAINE,"Are you kidding? I have seen the changes in you the past couple of years. Man, you have grown. You've matured."
S07E02,GEORGE,"Well, I guess I'm getting older."
S07E02,ELAINE,"Oh! Well, I just think it's wonderful. Honestly! I've gotta run, but um, please, please give my best to Susan."
S07E02,GEORGE,Yeah.
S07E02,ELAINE,"My most, just heartfelt congratulations."
S07E02,GEORGE,"Yeah. Thanks. Hey, listen, if you ever get a date, maybe the four of us could go out together sometime."
S07E02,ELAINE,"Yes! Yes, yes. Sure."
S07E02,GEORGE,"Wait, as a matter of fact, wasn't there some guy in your building that you said you liked? He lived up on the fifth floor or something."
S07E02,ELAINE,"Yes. Yes, yes. Yes."
S07E02,GEORGE,"Yeah! Boy, she is something, isn't she?"
S07E02,JERRY,"Yeah, she's something else. Hey, so what happened? Did you hold your ground or...uh"
S07E02,GEORGE,Nope. I wept like a baby.
S07E02,JERRY,What?
S07E02,GEORGE,"Well, I started to tell her and then all of the sudden, for some reason, I just burst into tears."
S07E02,JERRY,You cried?
S07E02,GEORGE,"I bawled uncontrollably. I just poured my guts out. And I'll tell you, Jerry, it was incredible. I never realized how powerful these tears are. I could have postponed it another five years if I wanted to."
S07E02,"JERRY, GEORGE, & KRAMER",Hey!
S07E02,JERRY,Sorry about that movie-thing. I was joking around.
S07E02,KRAMER,"Sorry? Are you kidding? You did me the biggest favor of my life. I spoke to a lawyer, we're suing for millions."
S07E02,JERRY,Suing? What for?
S07E02,KRAMER,The coffee was too hot.
S07E02,JERRY,It's supposed to be hot.
S07E02,KRAMER,Not THAT hot.
S07E02,RABBI,(On TV) The prophet Isaah tells us without friends our lives are empty and meaningless.
S07E02,GEORGE,Wait. Whoa! That's the Rabbi from Elaine's building. I just met this guy the other day.
S07E02,RABBI,"A young lady I know, let's call her Elaine, happened to find herself overwhelmed with feelings of resentment and hostility for her friend, let's call him George. She felt that George was somewhat of a loser and that she was the one who deserved to be married first. She also happened to mention to me that her friend had wondered if going to a prostitute while you're engaged is considered cheating. His feeling was they're never going to see each other again so what's the difference. But that is a subject for another sermon. Now, I'd like to close with a psalm."
S07E03,[Setting,Booth at Monk's Cafe]
S07E03,GEORGE,"And then I hear this rabbi on television, I mean imagine."
S07E03,ELAINE,"I'm really sorry George, I, I, I wasn't jealous of you. It was just the whole marriage thing."
S07E03,GEORGE,"Ya know, I was just a little surprised."
S07E03,JERRY,Why would anyone eat canned fruit? I mean can anybody answer that?
S07E03,GEORGE,What about all the loser stuff?
S07E03,ELAINE,"I don't know where the rabbi got that. Ya know I never said that. I said ""I've never seen you looser""."
S07E03,JERRY,"I can see the can if you're in the army, but fresh fruit it's available, it's there, it's 2 aisles over."
S07E03,GEORGE,"(Gets up to leave) Well, scintillating as always."
S07E03,JERRY,Where you going?
S07E03,GEORGE,I'm going shopping with Susan.
S07E03,ELAINE,What kind of shopping?
S07E03,GEORGE,Clothes shopping.
S07E03,ELAINE,Where are you going?
S07E03,GEORGE,Ross'.
S07E03,ELAINE,Oh that's a nice store.
S07E03,GEORGE,"Yeah, it's her uncle's."
S07E03,JERRY,Discount?
S07E03,GEORGE,(As he leaves) One would hope.
S07E03,[Setting,Jackie Child's Office]
S07E03,KRAMER,"So ya know, my friend and I we were going to the movies and we stopped off and bought this cafe latte."
S07E03,JACKIE,(Agreeing) Hm Hm. Oh what is that like Italian coffee?
S07E03,KRAMER,Yeah that's right.
S07E03,JACKIE,"Half milk, half coffee?"
S07E03,KRAMER,Yeah.
S07E03,JACKIE,Hm Hm. You take a sip?
S07E03,KRAMER,Yes I did.
S07E03,JACKIE,"Now when you took a sip, did you notice it was hot? Were you able to sip it in your normal fashion?"
S07E03,KRAMER,No I wasn't able to sip it in my normal fashion.
S07E03,JACKIE,"Hm Hm. All right, all right. You take big sips?"
S07E03,KRAMER,Well I think I take a normal sip.
S07E03,JACKIE,O.K. You take normal sips. Nothing wrong with that. Then what happened?
S07E03,KRAMER,"Well you know ahh, they don't allow outside drinks in the movie theater. So I had to put it in my shirt and sneak it in."
S07E03,JACKIE,"Yeah, see they like to sell their own coffee."
S07E03,KRAMER,"Yeah, now is that going to be a problem?"
S07E03,JACKIE,"Yeah that's going to be a problem. It's gonna be a problem for them. This a clear violation of your rights as a consumer. It's an infringement on your constitutional rights. It's outrageous, egregious, preposterous."
S07E03,KRAMER,It's definitely preposterous.
S07E03,JACKIE,So. Then what happened?
S07E03,KRAMER,Well ahh. I was trying to get to my seat and I had to step over someone and I kind of got pushed and it spilled on me.
S07E03,JACKIE,Was there a top on it?
S07E03,KRAMER,Yeah.
S07E03,JACKIE,Now did you put the top on or did they put the top on for you?
S07E03,KRAMER,No. They put the top on.
S07E03,JACKIE,And they made the top. You didn't make the top did you?
S07E03,JACKIE,(To secretary over intercom) Suzie. I want you to go down to Java World. Get me a cafe latte with a top. (To Kramer) We're gonna run some test on that top. Have you been to the doctor?
S07E03,KRAMER,"Ah No no, I haven't."
S07E03,JACKIE,(To secretary over intercom) Suzie. Call Dr. Bison. Set up an appointment for Mr. Kramer here. Tell him it's from me.
S07E03,KRAMER,"So ah, what do you think Mr. Chiles."
S07E03,JACKIE,Jackie.
S07E03,KRAMER,"Jackie. I mean, we have a chance?"
S07E03,JACKIE,"Do we have a chance? You get me one coffee drinker on that jury, you gonna walk outta there a rich man."
S07E03,[Setting,Ross' clothing store]
S07E03,GEORGE,"I don't like it, it's red. It it's too flashy."
S07E03,SUSAN,Well you could use a little flash.
S07E03,GEORGE,All right. Don't change me. Susan. Don't change me. Ya know there are a lot of woman that would love to be in your position right now.
S07E03,SUSAN,Name one.
S07E03,MR ROSS,"So, you find anything?"
S07E03,SUSAN,"Oh, he's impossible to shop for uncle Ned."
S07E03,MR ROSS,I'm going on vacation to Costa Rica. Maybe I'll see you in a couple of weeks.
S07E03,SUSAN,O.K.
S07E03,SALESMAN,Excuse me Mr Ross.
S07E03,GEORGE,See now this I don't get.
S07E03,SUSAN,What?
S07E03,GEORGE,The security guard.
S07E03,SUSAN,What about him?
S07E03,GEORGE,Why does he have to stand?
S07E03,SUSAN,Because he's a security guard.
S07E03,GEORGE,But I mean look at him. He's gotta be on his feet like that all day? That's brutal. I think I'm gonna say something to your uncle.
S07E03,SUSAN,"George, you just met him. Don't say anything to him."
S07E03,GEORGE,Aren't you concerned about the security guard?
S07E03,SUSAN,Not really. (Walks away)
S07E03,GEORGE,(Thinking to himself) She's not concerned about the security guard. What kind of a person is this? I'm marrying a person who doesn't care that this man has to stand here 8 hours a day when he could easily be sitting.
S07E03,SUSAN,All right George. (She puts the red shirt up to him again) What do you think?
S07E03,[Setting,Elaine and Jerry are in Jerry's apartment.]
S07E03,JERRY,"So ah, what did you do last night?"
S07E03,ELAINE,Nothing.
S07E03,JERRY,"I know nothing, but what did you actually do?"
S07E03,ELAINE,Literally nothing. I sat in a chair and I stared.
S07E03,JERRY,Wow. That really is nothing.
S07E03,ELAINE,I told ya.
S07E03,KRAMER,Hey.
S07E03,JERRY,Hey.
S07E03,ELAINE,Hey.
S07E03,JERRY,What are you all dressed up for?
S07E03,KRAMER,Oh I ah just came from a meeting with my lawyer.
S07E03,JERRY,"Oh yeah, how's that looking?"
S07E03,KRAMER,"Oh I'll tell you how it's looking. My lawyer Jackie says if there is one coffee drinker on that jury, (in a very high voice) I'm gonna be a rich man."
S07E03,ELAINE,That's despicable. How does he know how all coffee drinkers will vote? I'm a coffee drinker. If I was on that jury I wouldn't give you a nickel Kramer.
S07E03,KRAMER,"Yeah, well you wouldn't be on that jury. He would have weeded you out."
S07E03,JERRY,Frankly I'm surprised you're so litigious.
S07E03,KRAMER,Oh I can be quite litigious.
S07E03,ELAINE,What I mean who ever heard of this anyway? Suing a company because there coffee is too hot? Coffee is supposed to be hot.
S07E03,KRAMER,Yeah but Jackie says the top was faulty.
S07E03,ELAINE,(Mocking) Jackie says the top was faulty.
S07E03,KRAMER,Hey Maestro!
S07E03,MAESTRO,"Ah, Kramer."
S07E03,KRAMER,I'm in here. How's it going.
S07E03,MAESTRO,Fine.
S07E03,JERRY,Hi Bob.
S07E03,JERRY,"(Apologetically) Oh, I'm sorry. Maestro."
S07E03,KRAMER,"Well, this is a surprise ha?"
S07E03,MAESTRO,I just wanted to drop off this Chinese balm for your burns. It's supposed to be great stuff. It's all herbal.
S07E03,KRAMER,"Oh Maestro, you, what are you doing? You don't have to do this. Do you believe this Maestro?"
S07E03,MAESTRO,It's nothing.
S07E03,KRAMER,"Yeah, ya know you haven't been around for a while."
S07E03,MAESTRO,"Oh yeah, I've been at my house in Tuscany."
S07E03,KRAMER,Oh Tuscany huh? Hear that Jerry? That's in Italy.
S07E03,JERRY,I hear it's ah beautiful there.
S07E03,MAESTRO,Well if you're thinking of getting a place there don't bother. There's really nothing available.
S07E03,JERRY,(Surprised) Huh?
S07E03,MAESTRO,(Seeing Elaine) Oh!
S07E03,ELAINE,Hello.
S07E03,MAESTRO,Well Hello. And who might you be?
S07E03,ELAINE,I might be Elaine.
S07E03,JERRY,"This is a, Bob Cobb."
S07E03,KRAMER,Maestro.
S07E03,ELAINE,"Oh, Maestro."
S07E03,MAESTRO,It is my very great pleasure. (Kisses Elaine's hand)
S07E03,ELAINE,Enchante.
S07E03,MAESTRO AND ELAINE (Simultaneously),Well I have to be going.
S07E03,ELAINE,Jinx buy me a coke.
S07E03,MAESTRO,Oh. Love it when that happeneds.
S07E03,ELAINE,I know I know. That is so ahh ......
S07E03,MAESTRO,Coincidental.
S07E03,ELAINE,"Yeah, thanks. O.K. Bye you guys."
S07E03,MAESTRO,Ciao.
S07E03,KRAMER,"Yeah, yeah oh hey and a thanks for the balm. Yeah."
S07E03,KRAMER,You know you hurt the Maestro's feelings.
S07E03,JERRY,"Oh what, because I didn't call him Maestro?"
S07E03,KRAMER,That's right.
S07E03,JERRY,Ya know I feel a little funny calling somebody Maestro.
S07E03,KRAMER,Why?
S07E03,JERRY,Because it's a stupid thing to be called.
S07E03,KRAMER,Jerry he's a conductor.
S07E03,JERRY,Oh conductor. He conducts the Policeman's Benevolent Association Orchestra.
S07E03,KRAMER,"Well, he's still a conductor."
S07E03,JERRY,Well he sure worked pretty fast with Elaine.
S07E03,KRAMER,"Oh, you should see him do 'Flight of the Bumble Bee'."
S07E03,[Setting,Monks Cafe. George and Jerry are sitting across from each other]
S07E03,JERRY,New shirt?
S07E03,GEORGE,Yeah. You like it.
S07E03,JERRY,"No, not particularly."
S07E03,GEORGE,"Why, the color?"
S07E03,JERRY,Yeah.
S07E03,GEORGE,Too flashy?
S07E03,JERRY,"Yeah, it's burning my retina. Susan picked that out for you right?"
S07E03,GEORGE,(Obviously lying) No.
S07E03,JERRY,(Reaches for a menu) All right what's it going to be here.
S07E03,GEORGE,"Let me ask you something. When you go into a store, does it bother you that they make the security guard just stand there all day?"
S07E03,JERRY,No.
S07E03,GEORGE,"See, didn't bother Susan either. That's why I'm different. I can sense the slightest human suffering."
S07E03,JERRY,Are you sensing anything right now?
S07E03,GEORGE,"Let me just say this. It is inhumane to make a man stand on his feet, in one spot for eight hours a day. Why shouldn't he have a chair?"
S07E03,JERRY,"Well, what about criminal activity? He's got to be alert."
S07E03,GEORGE,"What, he can't jump out of the chair? How long does that take? Here look at this. (he moves to the end of the booth) Here, watch. (stands up) Criminals. Boom. I'm up. (pretends he's shooting) Stop It! Stop It! Stop It!"
S07E03,JERRY,Maybe they offered him a chair and he turned it down.
S07E03,GEORGE,Would you get out of here. Who's gonna turn down a chair? I would be very interested to know how he felt about all of this. Maybe I'll have a talk with him.
S07E03,JERRY,I know you will.
S07E03,KRAMER,"Hey, hey, hey, listen to this. Jackie just called."
S07E03,GEORGE,Who?
S07E03,JERRY,His lawyer.
S07E03,KRAMER,"Yeah, Java World wants to settle."
S07E03,JERRY,What?
S07E03,KRAMER,"Yeah, I'm gonna be rich."
S07E03,JERRY,Why are they settling?
S07E03,KRAMER,Cause their afraid of bad publicity.
S07E03,JERRY,All this because you spilled coffee on yourself?
S07E03,KRAMER,Yeah that's right.
S07E03,GEORGE,(Very loud in the direction of a waiter) I'm gonna need a coffee here. Very hot! Boiling!
S07E03,[Setting,Restaurant. Maestro and Elaine are talking)
S07E03,MAESTRO,And then about four years ago I was on holiday in Tuscany.
S07E03,ELAINE,Uh ha.

S07E03,WAITER,Are you ready to order?
S07E03,ELAINE,Oh God. What are you getting Bob?
S07E03,MAESTRO,Good question. (to waiter) We'll need a few minutes.
S07E03,MAESTRO,"You know, I'm sorry but, I didn't mention it earlier but actually I preferred to be called Maestro."
S07E03,ELAINE,Excuse me?
S07E03,MAESTRO,"Well, ya know I am a conductor."
S07E03,ELAINE,"Yeah, so?"
S07E03,MAESTRO,Oh I suppose it's O.K. for Leonard Burnstein to be called Maestro because he conducted the New York Philharmonic. So he gets to be called Maestro and I don't.
S07E03,ELAINE,"Well, I mean don't you think that he was probably called Maestro while he was conducting, not in social situations. I mean his friends probably just called him Lenny."
S07E03,MAESTRO,"I happen to know for a fact, that he was called Maestro in social situations. I once saw him at a bar and someone came up to him and said ""Hello Maestro, how about a beer"". O.K. So that's a fact."
S07E03,ELAINE,Maestro huh? O.K. (laughing)

S07E03,KRAMER,So? My lawsuit. I'm finished.

S07E03,GUARD,I don't need a chair.
S07E03,GEORGE,"No I didn't mean to imply that you did. You're obviously a very well proportioned individual. I was just wondering, have they ever offered you a chair?"
S07E03,GUARD,Nope.
S07E03,GEORGE,Would you like a chair?
S07E03,GUARD,I suppose if they gave me one I'd sit down.
S07E03,GEORGE,"Ah ha, Ah ha. You would, wouldn't you?"
S07E03,GUARD,"Obviously I'd rather sit than stand, if that's what your asking."
S07E03,GEORGE,That's exactly my point.
S07E03,GUARD,Well who wouldn't?
S07E03,GEORGE,"Cause I tell you, frankly, I would like to walk in hear one day and find you sitting down. (Starts to walk out of the store) That would give me a lot of pleasure. Call me crazy."

S07E03,JACKIE,"You put the balm on? Who told you to put the balm on? I didn't tell you to put the balm on. Why'd you put the balm on? You haven't even been to see the doctor. If your gonna put a balm on, let a doctor put a balm on."
S07E03,KRAMER,I guess I screwed up huh Jackie?
S07E03,JACKIE,Your damn right you screwed up. Where the hell did you get that damm balm anyway?
S07E03,KRAMER,The Maestro.
S07E03,JACKIE,The who? What are you talking about Maestro?
S07E03,KRAMER,My friend he's a conductor.
S07E03,JACKIE,"Oh oh oh, so a Maestro tells you to put a balm on and you do it?"
S07E03,KRAMER,Well my stomach was burning.
S07E03,JACKIE,I tell you what this is. This is a public humiliation.
S07E03,KRAMER,Well I didn't know the balm was gonna work.
S07E03,JACKIE,Do you know what a balm is? Have you ever seen a balm? Didn't you read the instructions?
S07E03,KRAMER,Well I ...
S07E03,JACKIE,(interrupts) No one can tell what a balm's gonna do. They're unpredictable.
S07E03,KRAMER,I'm sorry Jackie.
S07E03,JACKIE,(To cab driver) Pull over here driver this is it.
S07E03,KRAMER,"(Motions with his head) Yeah, get over."

S07E03,ELAINE,"Yeah, he's very interesting. Did you know that Mozart died while he was writing 'The Requiem'."
S07E03,JERRY,"(Sarcastically) Yeah, everyone knows that, it was in Amadeus."
S07E03,ELAINE,Really?
S07E03,JERRY,"So what about the ""Maestro"" stuff. Did he make you call him Maestro."
S07E03,ELAINE,"Yeah, I called him Maestro."
S07E03,JERRY,You didn't mind?
S07E03,ELAINE,"Well, I did at first, but actually I kind of got used to it."
S07E03,JERRY,"O.K. from now on I want you to call me ""Jerry the Great""."
S07E03,ELAINE,"I am not calling you ""Jerry the Great""."
S07E03,JERRY,Why not you call him Maestro.
S07E03,ELAINE,He is a Maestro.
S07E03,JERRY,"Well, I'm great."
S07E03,ELAINE,So you say.
S07E03,JERRY,"What about his house in Tuscany, he mention that?"
S07E03,ELAINE,Yeah. (bragging) I'm invited.
S07E03,JERRY,"You know when I told him it was beautiful there, out of the clear blue sky he says there's nothing to rent. As if he doesn't want anyone else there."
S07E03,ELAINE,Why?
S07E03,JERRY,I don't know. Maybe he's embarrassed by Americans.
S07E03,ELAINE,"Yeah, well maybe there aren't any houses to rent there."
S07E03,JERRY,In all of Tuscany? I wonder.

S07E03,MS. JORDAN,"Listen, the faster we dispose of this the better. This thing gets into the paper it will kill us."
S07E03,MR STAR,"All right, we'll start at 50,000 and free coffee at all of our stores."

S07E03,KRAMER,(Interrupting) I'LL TAKE IT!!
S07E03,[Setting,Jackie and Kramer in the back of a cab]
S07E03,JACKIE,I'll take it? Who told you to take it? Did I tell you to take it?
S07E03,KRAMER,No.
S07E03,JACKIE,"I know the Maestro didn't tell you to take it, he wasn't there."
S07E03,KRAMER,Well I thought we were lucky to get anything.
S07E03,JACKIE,Free coffee?
S07E03,KRAMER,Yeah.
S07E03,JACKIE,I don't want free coffee. It's not hard to get coffee. I can get my own
S07E03,KRAMER,Well I didn't hear any Plus.
S07E03,JACKIE,20 years practicing law I've never experienced anything like this.

S07E03,JERRY,Hey you know we were just talking about you.
S07E03,MAESTRO,Oh yeah?
S07E03,JERRY,"Yeah, ya know the other day how you mentioned that there were no houses available in Tuscany?"
S07E03,MAESTRO,"You didn't find one, did you?"
S07E03,JERRY,No. I'm not really looking.
S07E03,MAESTRO,Nor should you.
S07E03,JERRY,So are you telling me there's not one house to rent in all of Tuscany?
S07E03,MAESTRO,"The houses are passed down from generation to generation, it's very hard."
S07E03,JERRY,"I can't get a sublet, a guest room, a cot, nothing?"
S07E03,MAESTRO,It's booked solid!
S07E03,ELAINE,It's BOOKED Jerry!
S07E03,JERRY,How'd you get yours?
S07E03,MAESTRO,"Got lucky. Come on, Elaine, let's take a ride, I was about to pop in some Verdi."
S07E03,JERRY,Maybe I'll check out France.
S07E03,JERRY,"Hey George, do you believe this guy?"
S07E03,GEORGE,Who?
S07E03,JERRY,Bob Cobb.
S07E03,GEORGE,Bob Cobb?
S07E03,JERRY,"You know, the Maestro."
S07E03,GEORGE,Oh I missed the Maestro?
S07E03,JERRY,"Yeah, get this, he tells me there are no houses any where in Tuscany to rent."
S07E03,GEORGE,Huh. Your renting a house in Tuscany?
S07E03,JERRY,No.
S07E03,GEORGE,So what do you care?
S07E03,[Setting,Monk's cafe. George and Jerry are sitting at the booth]
S07E03,JERRY,I just wish I could figure out if this guy is trying to keep me out of Tuscany.
S07E03,GEORGE,Of course he is. There's got to be houses for rent in Tuscany. Do you know how big Tuscany is?
S07E03,JERRY,I have no idea.
S07E03,GEORGE,It it's huge. It's probably like North Dakota.
S07E03,JERRY,"Oh, no way it's that big."
S07E03,GEORGE,It's a big region.
S07E03,JERRY,Do you know how big North Dakota is stupid?
S07E03,GEORGE,I don't know why I bother even talking to you.
S07E03,JERRY,"Hey, no one's got a gun to your head."
S07E03,GEORGE,All right.
S07E03,GEORGE,So I spoke to the security guard.
S07E03,JERRY,Yeah and?
S07E03,GEORGE,"Well it's tough to get a good read but I think if I brought him a chair, he'd sit."
S07E03,JERRY,So are you gonna get him a chair?
S07E03,GEORGE,Yup. It's really just a question of what kind. Thinking about a bar stool.
S07E03,JERRY,"Yeah, that would give him some height, be able to check things out. With a back or without."
S07E03,GEORGE,Oh I think I'd go for the back.
S07E03,JERRY,Swivel?
S07E03,GEORGE,I suppose he could swivel. Hey maybe one of those director's chairs. What do you think of those.
S07E03,JERRY,I thinks it's kind of a pompous look. You know my parents used to have a kitchen chair that would have been perfect.
S07E03,GEORGE,You mean one of those vinyl things?
S07E03,JERRY,Yes.
S07E03,GEORGE,"Vinyl yeah, maybe."
S07E03,JERRY,How can I figure out if there's any places to rent in Tuscany? Wait a minute. Poppy's from Tuscany. I'm gonna go call him.
S07E03,GEORGE,"Yeah, good luck. Hey I'll meet you outside."

S07E03,KRAMER,"(Speaking very fast and fidgety) You can't put a limit on my cafe lattes, it says so right here. And I don't want to get dirty looks when I come in here. If I want a cafe latte, you give me a cafe latte. And if I have any problems I'm gonna get my lawyer Jackie Chiles down here and your gonna be in really big trouble."
S07E03,JERRY,"Hey hey hey, slow down Eddie. What what's the matter?"
S07E03,KRAMER,"Awe there making faces at me cause I've had a couple of cafe lattes. But I'm entitled to them. I can have as many cafe lattes as I want, that was the settlement."
S07E03,JERRY,That's it?
S07E03,KRAMER,"That's it. What you want one George? I can get one for you. No problem. Jerry, you want one? They're delicious. My pleasure."
S07E03,JERRY,You've got to stop it. Your your all hopped up on the caffein.

S07E04,JAMES,This is your wake up service. It's 715
S07E04,ELAINE,"Oh, god. OH, I could use a few more hours sleep."
S07E04,JAMES,Hot date last night?
S07E04,ELAINE,I wish.
S07E04,JAMES,A woman with a sexy voice like yours its hard to believe your waking up alone.
S07E04,ELAINE,"Really? Thank you., wake up service . . . person."
S07E04,JAMES,Call me James.
S07E04,ELAINE,"Oh, all right, James. He he he"
S07E04,GEORGE,Your wake up guy asked you out?
S07E04,ELAINE,"Yeah, I've never seen him but I feel like we have this weirdly intimate relationship. I mean, I'm lying in bed, I'm wearing my nightie,"
S07E04,JERRY,I don't know. Blind date?
S07E04,ELAINE,What? You're going to go out with my cousin Holly. You've never met her.
S07E04,JERRY,"Yeah, but I've seen pictures of her."
S07E04,ELAINE,At least I've spoken to my guy. You're going out on a deaf date.
S07E04,JERRY,I think I'd rather go out on a deaf date than a blind date. The question is whether you'd rather date the blind or the deaf.
S07E04,ELAINE,"Ah, . . ."
S07E04,GEORGE,Now you're off on a topic.
S07E04,JERRY,"You know, I think, I would rather date the deaf."
S07E04,ELAINE,Uh hu.
S07E04,JERRY,Because I think the blind would probably be a little messier around the house. And lets face it they're not going to get all the crumbs. I'd possibly be walking around with a sponge.
S07E04,GEORGE,You see I disagree. I'd rather be dating the blind. You know you could let the house go. You could let yourself go. A good looking blind woman doesn't even know you're not good enough for her.
S07E04,ELAINE,I think she'd figure it out.
S07E04,ELAINE,What? What is this?
S07E04,JERRY,Veggie sandwich and a grapefruit.
S07E04,ELAINE,Veggie sandwich and a grapefruit? What are you turning into?

S07E04,GEORGE,Morgan? No. He's doing a great job. (winks)
S07E04,WILHELM,I understand.
S07E04,JERRY,"I still can't believe, you're going out on a blind date."
S07E04,ELAINE,I'm not worried. It sounds like he's really good looking.
S07E04,JERRY,You're going by sound? What are we? Whales?
S07E04,ELAINE,I think I can tell.
S07E04,JERRY,"Elaine, what percentage of people would you say are good looking?"
S07E04,ELAINE,Twenty-five percent.
S07E04,JERRY,"Twenty-five percent, you say? No way! It's like 4 to 6 percent. It's a twenty to one shot."
S07E04,ELAINE,You're way off.
S07E04,JERRY,Way off? Have you been to the motor vehicle bureau? It's like a leper colony down there.
S07E04,ELAINE,So what you are saying is that 90 to 95 percent of the population is undateable?
S07E04,JERRY,UNDATEABLE!
S07E04,ELAINE,Then how are all these people getting together?
S07E04,JERRY,Alcohol.
S07E04,ELAINE,(to George who is winking) What is your problem?
S07E04,GEORGE,No problem here.
S07E04,ELAINE,You keep winking at me. That's really obnoxious.
S07E04,GEORGE,I had no idea.
S07E04,ELAINE,Right there. Right there. You just did it again.
S07E04,GEORGE,Wait a minute. Wait a minute. It's from that grapefruit that Jerry squirted at me.
S07E04,ELAINE,You're eye still hurts?
S07E04,GEORGE,"Yeah, yeah. You must have squirted a piece of pulp in it too."
S07E04,JERRY,Pulp couldn't make it across the table.
S07E04,GEORGE,"Pulp can move, Baby! Why didn't you eat a real breakfast?"
S07E04,JERRY,"Hey, I eat healthy. If I have to take out an eye, that's the breaks."
S07E04,GEORGE,Wait a minute. I must have been winking down at the office. That's why Mr. Wilhelm was acting so mysteriouso.
S07E04,ELAINE,"What did he think, you were flirtin' with him?"
S07E04,GEORGE,"Hu, oh. No he thought I was hiding something from him about Morgan."

S07E04,KRAMER,"Um, can I show this to my buddy Stubbs . He runs a sports memorabilia store. He pays top dollar for pro autographs."
S07E04,GEORGE,"Yeah, like I'm going to risk my job with the New York Yankees to make a few extra bucks. (winks)"
S07E04,KRAMER,"No, of course not. (winks back)"
S07E04,KRAMER,"You know, you see Don Matingly signed this envelope then he sent it to room 318, where it was received and signed for by manager Buck Showalter."
S07E04,STEINBRENNER,I don't know. An envelope doesn't really cut it.
S07E04,KRAMER,Why?
S07E04,STEINBRENNER,What is this? A birthday card. Ha ha . . . signed by the ENTIRE Yankee organization! . . . This could be worth something.
S07E04,GEORGE,Is that the lovely Mrs. Morgan?

S07E04,HOLLY,When we were little girls Grandma Memma would take us to a matinee and then dinner here.
S07E04,JERRY,Grandma Memma?
S07E04,HOLLY,Elaine must have mentioned Grandma Memma.
S07E04,JERRY,"No, I think I would have remembered Memma."
S07E04,HOLLY,"Oh well, that's typical. Elaine never liked Grandma Memma."
S07E04,WAITER,Ready?
S07E04,HOLLY,"I'll have the porterhouse medium rare, baked potato with sour cream,"
S07E04,JERRY,What do you recommend besides the steak?
S07E04,WAITER,The lamb chops are good.
S07E04,JERRY,Anything lighter? How do you prepare the chicken?
S07E04,WAITER,"It's a full bird. Stuffed with ham, topped with gorganzola."
S07E04,JERRY,You know what? I think I'll just have the salad.
S07E04,WAITER,. . . Thank you.
S07E04,JERRY,(mind's voice) Just a salad? Just a salad? Just a salad?

S07E04,GEORGE,"Hey, Mr. Morgan how was your massage?"
S07E04,MORGAN,I had to cancel it. For some reason my wife got it into her head that it was more than just a massage.
S07E04,GEORGE,Really?
S07E04,MORGAN,"Yeah, we had this big fight at lunch it looks like tonight I will be sleeping on the couch."
S07E04,GEORGE,"Hey, listen don't oversleep. You can't afford to be late again."
S07E04,MORGAN,I know. Somebody around here has been giving Wilhelm the impression that I have been slacking off.
S07E04,GEORGE,"Geez, Hey you know something, you should try my friend's wake up service. She swears by this thing."
S07E04,MORGAN,"Costanza, you may be my only friend around here. By the way, you got that birthday card?"
S07E04,GEORGE,"Ah, not yet."
S07E04,MORGAN,Just make sure Steinbrenner doesn't get it until I sign it.
S07E04,GEORGE,Yes sir!
S07E04,ELAINE,I just don't understand it as soon as I met these dogs they started growling at me.
S07E04,JERRY,Maybe his dogs heard about how you tried to kidnap that other dog. These muts like to gossip. So have you talked too Holly?
S07E04,ELAINE,Huh huh.
S07E04,JERRY,Did she mention anything about our lunch?
S07E04,ELAINE,"Uh, kind of."
S07E04,JERRY,"What do you mean, ""kind of.""?"
S07E04,ELAINE,"I mean, she thought it was kind of strange to just order a salad. . . . You know. . . . For a man."
S07E04,JERRY,What are you saying? . . . Salad! What was I thinking? Women don't respect salad eaters.
S07E04,ELAINE,You got that right.
S07E04,JERRY,"But you're going over there for dinner tonight, right?"
S07E04,ELAINE,Um uh.
S07E04,JERRY,What is she making?
S07E04,ELAINE,"I don't know. But I'm sure it had, . . . parents. Call her up. She won't mind if you come."
S07E04,JERRY,"Oh, don't worry. I'll be there and I'll be packing an artery."

S07E04,KRAMER,You'll be pleased to see what's inside.
S07E04,GEORGE,What is this?
S07E04,KRAMER,You're cut of the loot. Stubs gave me 200 dollars for the autographed birthday card that was inside.
S07E04,GEORGE,Who told you to sell the card?
S07E04,KRAMER,You did.
S07E04,GEORGE,No I didn't!
S07E04,KRAMER,"No, not in so many words but I believe we had an understanding. (winks)"
S07E04,GEORGE,I was not winking you idiot. That was the grapefruit. It's like acid. I need that card back. It's Mr. Steinbrenner's. I was responsible.
S07E04,KRAMER,Well Stubs has already sold it to some guy who's kid's in the hospital .
S07E04,GEORGE,Well get it back! It's very important. (winks)
S07E04,KRAMER,"Look, do you want me to get it back or not?"
S07E04,GEORGE,(holds eyes wide open) Get it back!
S07E04,ELAINE,"Such a lovely table setting. Oh, wear did you get these napkins?"
S07E04,HOLLY,They're grandma Memma's.
S07E04,ELAINE,"Oh, I don't remember them."
S07E04,HOLLY,"Oh, you wouldn't. She only used them on special occasions."
S07E04,ELAINE,Special occassions? It wasn't special when my family visited?
S07E04,HOLLY,Everybody like mutton?
S07E04,JERRY,"Um, mutton! Hope you didn't cut the fat off."
S07E04,KRAMER,That you Bobby?
S07E04,BOBBY,huh
S07E04,KRAMER,"Well, I heard that you have a very uh, special birthday card .with all the Yankee autographs on it."
S07E04,BOBBY,Sure do. Mister.
S07E04,KRAMER,"Oh, that's it, yeah. Boy, Stubs sure went to town with this thing huh? Yeah, well, Bobby, uh, what if I told you a very important person at the New York Yankees needed this card back."
S07E04,BOBBY,"Oh, no. I'd never part with this card for anything in the world."
S07E04,KRAMER,"Well, uh, Bobby, uh, who's your favorite Yankee."
S07E04,BOBBY,Paul O'Neill.
S07E04,KRAMER,"All right. What if I tell Paul O'Neill to hit a home run tomorrow, just for you."
S07E04,BOBBY,Would he? Paul O'Neill would do that?
S07E04,KRAMER,For you he would.
S07E04,BOBBY,Would he hit two home runs?
S07E04,KRAMER,"Two? Sure kid, yeah. But then you gotta promise you'll do something for me."
S07E04,BOBBY,I know. Get out of this bed one day and walk again.
S07E04,KRAMER,"Yeah, that would be nice. But I really just need this card."
S07E04,ELAINE,What about this candelabra?
S07E04,HOLLY,"Yeah, that was grandma Memma's also. She bought it on her trip to Europe in 1936. Jerry, I'm thrilled you like my mutton. I was afrais you only ate . . . salad."
S07E04,JERRY,"Hey, salad's got nothin' on this mutton."
S07E04,HOLLY,That is so funny. Did you just make that up?
S07E04,JERRY,I wish I could take credit for it. It's actually the line my butcher uses when we're chewing the fat. How about that beautiful desk over there? (hides meat in napkin in jacket)
S07E04,HOLLY,That was in Grandma's study.
S07E04,ELAINE,"What did you do, ransack the place after she died?"
S07E04,JERRY,This is some FINE mutton.
S07E04,ELAINE,I'm getting out of here. Can I borrow your jacket?
S07E04,JERRY,"Uh, well, uh the thing is that . . . (Jerry grabs jacket back)"
S07E04,ELAINE,"It's cold out, and I didn't bring my own. Jerry! God forbid I should borrow one from Holly. It might have belonged to grandma Memma. Thanks for mutton."
S07E04,ELAINE,"Down boy, nice doggy . I'm a nice person. Don't believe what you hear."
S07E04,HOLLY,Where are the napkins?
S07E04,JERRY,What?
S07E04,HOLLY,Grandma Memma's napkins. There's two missing. Elaine took them didn't she?
S07E04,JERRY,I don't know about that. Have you got any floss?
S07E04,HOLLY,You heard her. She coveted them. I bet she took them just to spite me. She's probably having a good laugh about it right now.
S07E04,ELAINE,Down doggy . oh oh a a a a a
S07E04,JERRY,"Elaine, what are you doing in this neighborhood?"
S07E04,ELAINE,Did you do with the dogs?
S07E04,JERRY,"Yeah, they're in the kitchen. . . . okay, quite! What's going on?"
S07E04,ELAINE,These dogs were chasing me. And no cab would stop and I had to get off the street. Then I remembered that you lived here.
S07E04,JERRY,Why were dogs chasing you?
S07E04,ELAINE,They just don't like me. It's a long story. I can tell you one day but I can't tell you right now.
S07E04,JERRY,I would askk you to stay tonight but I only have the sofa bed and it's where I sleep.
S07E04,ELAINE,We'll have to sleep head to toe.
S07E04,JERRY,Head to toe?
S07E04,ELAINE,Head to toe.
S07E04,ELAINE,"Hey, wake up. It's 830 you were supposed to walk me up at 715."
S07E04,JERRY,I'm sorry I didn't get any sleep you kept kicking me in the face.
S07E04,ELAINE,You're a wake up guy. Don't you have calls to make?
S07E04,JERRY,I'll make them later. Uh.
S07E04,WILHELM,Have you seen Morgan?
S07E04,GEORGE,He's not here?
S07E04,WILHELM,"No, He's late."
S07E04,GEORGE,It's impossible. I got him a wake up service.
S07E04,WILHELM,"Now, George, you don't have to cover for him any more. He's going to be gone soon and I'm going to recommend you for his job."
S07E04,GEORGE,. . . gone?
S07E04,JERRY,It sounds like all the winking got you a promotion.
S07E04,GEORGE,"I don't want Morgan's job. He's got a lot of work to do. Hey, Elaine, your friend never woke up Mr. Morgan."
S07E04,ELAINE,"Nah, he was tired. He had some feet in his face. My cousin Holly is completely insane. She keeps calling and accusing me of stealing her napkins."
S07E04,GEORGE,Napkins?
S07E04,ELAINE,"I mean, why? Why would I take her stupid napkins."
S07E04,JERRY,Because they were in the pockets of my jacket.
S07E04,ELAINE,They were?
S07E04,JERRY,Yes. I was using them to spit out the mutton.
S07E04,ELAINE,Spit it out? I had dogs chasing me for that mutton. I was almost mauled because of that mutton.
S07E04,GEORGE,What exactly is mutton?
S07E04,JERRY,I don't know and I didn't want to find out. So where is my jacket?
S07E04,ELAINE,"Oh, I must have left it at Jame's"
S07E04,JERRY,You spent the night at James's? Did we?
S07E04,ELAINE,Yeah but we reversed positions so there was no funny business.
S07E04,JERRY,Reversed positions?
S07E04,ELAINE,"Yeah, you know, head to toe."
S07E04,JERRY,So what your genitals are still lined up.
S07E04,ELAINE,"No, because I slept with my back to him."
S07E04,KRAMER,Mr. O'Neill?
S07E04,O'NEILL,Yeah.
S07E04,KRAMER,"Yeah, uh, look, you don't know me."
S07E04,O'NEILL,"I can give you an autograph there, but my pen's kind of screwed up. You'd only like half a ""P"" or something."
S07E04,KRAMER,"No, it's uh, not that see,. It's about a little boy in a hospital. I was wondering if you could do something to lift his spirits."
S07E04,O'NEILL,"Sure, I could help you there."
S07E04,KRAMER,"Sure, well I promised you would hit him two home runs."
S07E04,O'NEILL,Say what?
S07E04,KRAMER,"You know, Klick!. A couple of dingers."
S07E04,O'NEILL,You promised a kid in the hospital that I would hit two home runs?
S07E04,KRAMER,"Yeah, well, no good?"
S07E04,O'NEILL,Yeah. That's no good. It's terrible. You don't hit home runs like that. It's hard to hit home runs. And where the heck did you get two from?
S07E04,KRAMER,Two is better than one.
S07E04,O'NEILL,"That, that's ridiculous. I'm not a home run hitter."
S07E04,KRAMER,"Well, Babe Ruth did it."
S07E04,O'NEILL,He did not.
S07E04,KRAMER,"Oh, do you say that Babe Ruth is a liar?"
S07E04,O'NEILL,I'm not calling him a liar but he was not stupid enough to promise two.
S07E04,KRAMER,"Well, maybe I did overextend myself."
S07E04,O'NEILL,How the heck did you get in here anyway?
S07E04,JAMES,"(on phone) Oh, hi Elaine. You know I lost all of my 630 clients because of you. . . . Yeah, well why did you have to stick your feet in my face? . . . Yes, I have the jacket. Hold on. . . . (to dogs) Fellas!"
S07E04,TV,The Yankees take the field on a beautiful afternoon.
S07E04,KRAMER,"It's hot in here. Hey, Bobby, can I have some of your juice?"
S07E04,BOBBY,After Paul O'Neill hits his first home run.
S07E04,HOLLY,(from buzzer) It's Holly.
S07E04,JERRY,Yeah. Come on up.
S07E04,TV,And the two and one pitch to O'Neill. A towering shot back to deep right field and it's gone.
S07E04,KRAMER,Yeah.
S07E04,TV,A home run for Paul O'Neill. The Yanks lead one nothing.
S07E04,KRAMER,OH YEAH! ALL RIGHT!
S07E04,BOBBY,One more to go.
S07E04,JERRY,Hey. What's all this?
S07E04,HOLLY,I decided I was going to make you dinner.
S07E04,JERRY,I thought we were going out.
S07E04,HOLLY,"Well, after you scarfed up my mutton I had the irresistible urge to make pork chops for you. I said hello to Franco for you."
S07E04,JERRY,Franco?
S07E04,HOLLY,"Your butcher, down the street."
S07E04,JERRY,I bet he acted aloof like he didn't know me.
S07E04,HOLLY,A little.
S07E04,JERRY,That is so Franco.
S07E04,TV,"Bottom of the eighth, score tied at one apiece. Two and one to Paul O'Neill."
S07E04,KRAMER,"You know Bobby, it's very very hard to hit two home runs in one game. Even for Paul O'Neill."
S07E04,KRAMER,"He can do it, Mr. Kramer. I know he can. He'll do it for me."
S07E04,TV,"""Klick! Long fly ball into deep left field over Bell's head . . . O'Neill's rounding second O'Neill going for third, O'Neill rounding . . ."
S07E04,KRAMER,Come on Come on!
S07E04,TV,. . . third being waived in.
S07E04,KRAMER,GO! GO!!
S07E04,TV,. . . Martinez throws it over Alomar's head. O'Neill is safe at home. And the Yankees take the lead.
S07E04,KRAMER,An In The Park Home Run!
S07E04,BOBBY,Yeay!
S07E04,KRAMER,"All Right! Yeah, well, I guess I'll be on my way (grabs framed card)"
S07E04,TV,That's being scored a triple for Paul O'Neill with a throwing error charged to Martinez.
S07E04,BOBBY,"Hey,"
S07E04,KRAMER,Huh?
S07E04,BOBBY,that's not a home run. (grabs frame)
S07E04,KRAMER,"Yeah, maybe not technically, but"
S07E04,BOBBY,You said he'd hit two home runs.
S07E04,KRAMER,"Oh, come on. Bobby, Bobby! That's just as good!"
S07E04,BOBBY,"Well, you're not taking that card."
S07E04,KRAMER,"Now, Bobby, Bobby, we had a deal . . . gimme that"
S07E04,HOLLY,"So, is the chop the way you like it?"
S07E04,JERRY,I usually like mine with an angioplasty.
S07E04,ELAINE,You know something really stinks to high h Holly! What are you doing here?
S07E04,JERRY,What everyone does here. - Cooking pork chops.
S07E04,ELAINE,"I'm uh, I'm meeting James here. He's bringing over your jacket."
S07E04,HOLLY,What about the napkins?
S07E04,ELAINE,I didn't take your napkins.
S07E04,HOLLY,Then who did?
S07E04,ELAINE,Ask Jerry.
S07E04,JERRY,We could argue all night over who took the napkins. The point is in today's modern world it just doesn't seem relevant.
S07E04,WILHELM,"I still want to know what happened to that birthday card? Now, Morgan, did you ever sign it?"
S07E04,MORGAN,"No sir, George never gave it to me."
S07E04,GEORGE,"No, that's right, I didn't. I take full responsibility for the card not being here. I, uh, . . ."
S07E04,KRAMER,"Hi,"
S07E04,WILHELM,What's this?
S07E04,KRAMER,"Oh, it's a birthday card."
S07E04,KRAMER,"(to George) Oh, by the way, tomorrow night, Paull O'Neill has to catch a fly ball in his hat."
S07E04,WILHELM,"George, this is beautiful. Why didn't you tell me you were going to have it mounted like this?"
S07E04,KRAMER,And you were probably just going to stick it in an envelope.
S07E04,WILHELM,"Ha ha ha ha ha, George, keep up the good work."
S07E04,MORGAN,"Ha ha, uh, well you screwed me again, Costanza. How am I supposed to sign the card now when it's already under glass?"
S07E04,ELAINE,"Uh, this is,"
S07E04,HOLLY,Excuse me. What are those dogs wearing?
S07E04,JAMES,"Oh, bandanas, aren't they cute?"
S07E04,HOLLY,You gave Memma's napkins to some dogs?!
S07E04,JERRY,"Hey, what happened to my jacket?"
S07E04,JAMES,"Oh, the dogs did that but it wasn't their fault, somebody stuffed some strange meat in the pocket."
S07E04,HOLLY,Was it mutton?
S07E04,JAMES,Could have been.
S07E04,HOLLY,Do you always stuff meat in your pocket?
S07E04,JERRY,"Uh, sometimes I use the sofa."
S07E04,GEORGE,"You wanted to see me, Mr. Steinbrenner?"
S07E04,STEINBRENNER,"Yes, George, please, come in, come in."
S07E04,STEINBRENNER,"Thanks for the card. I loved it. Gosh it made me feel good. You know, word has it that you were the brains behind the whole thing."
S07E04,GEORGE,"Oh, no, not just me, the whole organization. Especially Mr. Morgan."
S07E04,STEINBRENNER,"Morgan, Morgan, you know his name is conspicuously absent from this card. Almost like he went out of his way not to sign it."
S07E04,GEORGE,"Oh no, Morgan is a good man sir."
S07E04,STEINBRENNER,"You can stop kowtowing to Morgan. Congratulations, you got his job."
S07E04,GEORGE,"Wa, uh, thank you sir, you know I am not quite sure I'm right for it."
S07E04,STEINBRENNER,"Stop it George, he's out, you're in."
S07E04,STEINBRENNER,A lot more work you know.
S07E04,GEORGE,I know.
S07E04,STEINBRENNER,A lot more responsibility. Long long hours.
S07E04,GEORGE,I know.
S07E04,STEINBRENNER,Not much more money. But you'll finally get the recognition you deserve.
S07E04,GEORGE,"That's what I'm afraid of. You know Mr. Steinbrenner, . . ."
S07E04,STEINBRENNER,"You know as painfull as it is I had to let a few people go over the years. Yogi Berra, Lou Pinella, Bucky Dent, Billy Martin, Dallas Green, Dick Houser, Bill Virdon, Billy Martin, Scott Marrow, Billy Martin, Bob Lemmon, Billy Martin, Gene Michael, Buck Showalter,  uh, tut!, . . .George, you didn't hear that from me. (George exits) . . . George!"
S07E05,I always feel bad for the silver medal winner in the Olympics. How do you live with that the rest of your life? People are gonna keep asking,"- How much did you lose by? - I don't even know...! It was like...(very fast) now.now...now.now..now..was like, like... now..now..now...! It was it...! Eh, it was it and I lost. I trained, I worked out, I exercised, I did everything, I was doing push-ups, sit-ups, I never did anything but exercise and work out for 20 years, I flew half way around the world and aaaaaaaaaah!...(showing a tiny distance between his index and thumb) And that was...it was a photo-finish! Silver...(stretching his neck forward)...gold. If I had a pimple, I would've won."
S07E05,JERRY,"(to Elaine) I can't believe you write for this J.Peterman catalog. (to George) Get this one ""I packed my rod and reel. 30 hours later, lost in the fiord, a welcoming smile. Thank god she spotted the epaulettes on my Norwegian ice-fishing vest""."
S07E05,GEORGE,This catalog is all about how to score in a foreign country.
S07E05,ELAINE,Yeah. What do you do all day?
S07E05,GEORGE,Not that much.
S07E05,ELAINE,uh-uh.
S07E05,JERRY,I thought that new promotion was supposed to be a lot more work.
S07E05,GEORGE,"Yeah, when the season starts. Right now, I sit around pretending that I'm busy."
S07E05,JERRY,How do you pull that off?
S07E05,GEORGE,"I always look annoyed. Yeah, when you look annoyed all the time, people think that you're busy. Think about it... (acts annoyed for 3 seconds)."
S07E05,ELAINE,"Yeah, you do! He looks very busy!"
S07E05,JERRY,"Yeah, he looks busy! Yeah!"
S07E05,GEORGE,I know what I'm doin'. In fact Mr. Wilhelm gave me one of those little stress dolls. All right. (gets up) Back to work. (acts annoyed and leaves)
S07E05,ELAINE,(laughs)
S07E05,JERRY,So did you come up with a little stupid story for the Himalayan walking shoe yet?
S07E05,ELAINE,"No. I'm completely blocked! In fact, I'm gonna work on it tonight. Oh. Oh no! Oh, I can't! I got that marathon runner coming in tonight."
S07E05,JERRY,What marathon runner?
S07E05,ELAINE,"You know, this guy Jean-Paul, Jean-Paul... I met him when I was working at Pendant, editing a book on running..."
S07E05,JERRY,"Oh, wait! Jean-Paul, Jean-Paul! Isn't he the guy who overslept at the Olympics 4 years ago and missed the marathon?!"
S07E05,ELAINE,"Yeah, that's him."
S07E05,JERRY,"He's from uh...Trinidad and Tobago, right?"
S07E05,ELAINE,"Yeah, he's Trinidadian and...Tobagan. (laughs)"
S07E05,JERRY,How do you oversleep at the Olympics...?
S07E05,ELAINE,"Ah, I know. I know...!"
S07E05,JERRY,"I mean, it's like the biggest event of your life! You'd think you'd have, like, 6 alarm clocks, payin'-off little kids in the village to come banging on your door..."
S07E05,ELAINE,"Yeah, well, he was pretty devastated. This is his first race in 3 years."
S07E05,JERRY,Ah...that's a big responsability on your hands.
S07E05,ELAINE,What responsibility? I don't have any responsibility.
S07E05,JERRY,You gotta wake him up!
S07E05,ELAINE,Eh...he'll get up...
S07E05,ELAINE,"Hi, Judy."
S07E05,JUDY,"Hi, Elaine. How are you?"
S07E05,ELAINE,Fine. (laughs)
S07E05,JERRY,I've seen her in your building.
S07E05,ELAINE,Yeah.
S07E05,JERRY,I didn't know she was married.
S07E05,ELAINE,(whispering) She's not... and the guy just took off. (makes a sad face) Don't say anything to anybody.
S07E05,JERRY,Whom I gonna tell?
S07E05,ELAINE,"I know, it's just something you have to say..."
S07E05,WILHELM,"George, we just got the final budget numbers. We went over budget on some of the items, but I don't think there's gonna be a problem. (hands over the budget file to a very annoyed George) I'll let you get back to work, George. (Mr. Wilhelm leaves the office)"
S07E05,JERRY,He overslept and missed the whole race. Isn't that amazing?
S07E05,GEORGE,I'll tell you what happened. I bet he got the AM/PM mixed-up.
S07E05,JERRY,My money's on the snooze. I bet he hit the snooze for an extra 5 and it never came back on. (Kramer enters with a bucket and starts filling it with water on the sink) Imagine your whole life riding on an alarm clock.
S07E05,KRAMER,Alarm clocks? I never use 'em. Don't trust 'em.
S07E05,JERRY,What do you do?
S07E05,KRAMER,"I have a uh...mental alarm. I set my head for... quarter to seven and... (makes sound with the lips - ""pop!"") ...I get up!"
S07E05,JERRY,Always works?
S07E05,KRAMER,"It never fails. See, it's based on your body clock. See, your body has an internal mechanism. It knows what time it is."
S07E05,GEORGE,uh-uh. What's with the bucket?
S07E05,KRAMER,"Lomez, he sold me his hot tub."
S07E05,JERRY,Hot tub?
S07E05,KRAMER,"Yeah yeah, it's in my living room. I just gotta fill it. (points to bucket)"
S07E05,GEORGE,You put a hot tub... in your living room?
S07E05,KRAMER,"Oh, it's a beauty! It's got these high-volume aqua-sage jets oscillating and pulsating, soothing your every aching muscle. The water's gonna get over 120 degrees! (happy)"
S07E05,GEORGE,Is that tolerable?
S07E05,KRAMER,Oh...it's tolerable...! (happy)
S07E05,JERRY,Isn't that the same temperature the coffee that scalded you?
S07E05,KRAMER,"Oh, I think it's a little cooler than that... (smiles and leaves)"
S07E05,GEORGE,He uh...doesn't have any running water?
S07E05,JERRY,I don't ask those kind of questions anymore.
S07E05,ELAINE,"Jerry. Jerry, this is Jean-Paul."
S07E05,JERRY,"Ah, hi Jean-Paul. Nice to meet you."
S07E05,JEAN-PAUL,Nice to meet you.
S07E05,JERRY,Sorry about the Olympics.
S07E05,JEAN-PAUL,Me too. (disappointed)
S07E05,ELAINE,"Listen, listen I'm gonna go call work to see if I can get my deadline extended. I can't...come up with anything for this thing."
S07E05,JERRY,Ah...catalog writer's block?
S07E05,ELAINE,"Yeah, that's funny. (annoyed)"
S07E05,JERRY,"(pause) So what happened? The snooze alarm, wasn't it?"
S07E05,JEAN-PAUL,"Man, it wasn't the snooze. Most people think it was the snooze, but no, no snooze."
S07E05,JERRY,AM/PM.
S07E05,JEAN-PAUL,"Man, it wasn't the AM/PM. It was the volume."
S07E05,JERRY,Ah...the volume.
S07E05,JEAN-PAUL,"Yes, the volume. There was a separate knob for the radio alarm."
S07E05,JERRY,"Ah, separate knob."
S07E05,JEAN-PAUL,"Yes, separate knob. Why separate knob?! Why separate knob?! (frustrated)"
S07E05,JERRY,Some people like to have the radio alarm a little louder than the radio.
S07E05,JEAN-PAUL,"Oh, please, man, please!"
S07E05,JERRY,"Don't worry, it's not gonna happen again. Not if I have anything to say about it."
S07E05,JERRY,"Elaine, what's the alarm clock situation in your house?"
S07E05,ELAINE,Jerry...
S07E05,JERRY,It's a simple question...
S07E05,ELAINE,"I've got an alarm, ok?"
S07E05,JERRY,That old one? Didn't I once miss a flight to Cleveland because of that alarm clock?
S07E05,JEAN-PAUL,Flight to Cleveland?
S07E05,ELAINE,It works.
S07E05,JERRY,Elaine...
S07E05,ELAINE,It... works!
S07E05,GEORGE,Eh...come oooon...(starts stabbing the paper with the pen. Mr. Wilhelm comes in)
S07E05,WILHELM,George...I think you may be taking work a little too seriously.
S07E05,GEORGE,Well...I've got a lot to do!
S07E05,WILHELM,"George, I'll tell you what I'd like you to do. I, I'd like you to drop everything."
S07E05,WILHELM,"I have this... fun little assignment I think you'll enjoy. There's some reps in from the Houston Astros for talks on that interleague play... and I want you to show them a good time.(George acts like ""ok, you're the boss"")"
S07E05,ELAINE,Hey. Sorry I'm late.
S07E05,JERRY,You're 40 minutes late. What happened?
S07E05,ELAINE,I got held up. Do you mind if I heat this muffin up?
S07E05,JERRY,No.
S07E05,ELAINE,What? (Elaine puts her muffin in the microwave and sets the timer) What is the problem?
S07E05,JERRY,"Well, you said you were gonna be here at a certain time, and you weren't."
S07E05,ELAINE,uh-uh. uh-uh. And this all means uh...what?
S07E05,JERRY,"Well, means that a man has come from very far away to compete in a very difficult race, he's put his faith in you, and frankly, I'm a little concerned!"
S07E05,ELAINE,Oh are you?!
S07E05,JERRY,Yes I am.
S07E05,ELAINE,"Hey, I'm not running in the marathon! He is!"
S07E05,JERRY,"Yeah, I know that!"
S07E05,ELAINE,"Yeah, I got enough to think about just tryin' to come up with some load o'crap for that Himalayan walking shoe! I mean, I've given him a place to stay, I'll set an alarm, but I'm not gonna turn my life completely upside down for this guy!"
S07E05,JERRY,I'm not talking about upside down. (Jean-Paul and Kramer come in) I'm talking about waking him up!
S07E05,ELAINE,"Hey, Jean-Paul."
S07E05,JERRY,"Hey, Jean-Paul. How was your soak? Was a good soak?"
S07E05,JEAN-PAUL,"Ah, man, very good soak. The soak o'the year!"
S07E05,KRAMER,(smelling) What's burning?
S07E05,ELAINE,"Oh! (rushing to the microwave) My muffin! (opens microwave door) Oh, shoot! (slams it)"
S07E05,JERRY,What happened?
S07E05,ELAINE,Oh I don't know. I set this thing for 20 seconds.
S07E05,KRAMER,This was set for 2 minutes. See?
S07E05,ELAINE,(pointing at Jerry) Don't say anything! Don't..say..anything!
S07E05,JEAN-PAUL,You miss-set the timer...
S07E05,ELAINE,"(leaning against the refrigerator) Jean-Paul, it's not my microwave, ok? Ok? All right, listen, let's just go. Come on, Jean-Paul, let's go. Let's go."
S07E05,JEAN-PAUL,Ok.
S07E05,ELAINE,"(to Jerry) All right. We'll see you at the race, ok?"
S07E05,JERRY,Yeah. I hope so ?!
S07E05,ELAINE,Oh that's cute! (closes door and exits with Jean-Paul)
S07E05,JERRY,"Kramer, I'm tellin' you, Elaine doesn't know whatta hell she's doin'! I gotta take over this whole operation!"
S07E05,KRAMER,"Jerry, look how tense you are... You need to take a soak."
S07E05,JERRY,I'm not taking a soak in that human bacteria frat you got goin' there.
S07E05,KRAMER,"Come on, I'm tellin' you, it's great. I opened up all the windows... the air is cold, the tub is boiling hot... It's like Sweden, man. Sweeeeden!"
S07E05,KRAMER,(relaxing) ...oooohhh yeeaaah... aaahhh... (he is really enjoying this)
S07E05,CLAYTON,"...'till this bastard over here says ""let's call the sons o'bitches and go visit 'em on New York!"" (the 3 men laugh)"
S07E05,GEORGE,"(smiling) Well, we're certainly glad that you could make it."
S07E05,GARDNER,"I like your organization, George. We've been talkin' to a really friendly son of a bitch in the front office. Wilhelm, I think his name."
S07E05,GEORGE,"Oh yes, Mr.Wilhelm, yeah..."
S07E05,GARDNER,"He told us that George Costanza was gonna be takin' us bastards out on the town. (the 3 men laugh again) I said ""that son of a bitch doesn't know what he's got in store for him!"". (the 3 men laugh once more)"
S07E05,ZEKE,Finish your drink?
S07E05,GEORGE,"Oh yeah, al-almost. Almost."
S07E05,ZEKE,Let's get that bastard bring us another round! (waves to bartender)
S07E05,CLAYTON,"You a big drinker, George?"
S07E05,GEORGE,"Well...maybe not as much as this bastard... (points at Zeke, they all laugh) I can hold my own! (they all continue laughing and drinking)"
S07E05,JERRY,"Jean-Paul, I asked you down here this morning because I'm concerned. Concerned that tomorrow is perhaps the biggest race of your entire career. And the person with whom you have chosen to stay... is uh..."
S07E05,JEAN-PAUL,What are you saying?
S07E05,JERRY,"I'm saying ""get the hell outta there""! Let me put you in a hotel. You'll be comfortable, you'll be near the starting line, and most importantly... you'll have a wake-up call, Jean-Paul! A wake-up call!"
S07E05,JEAN-PAUL,Wake-up call...
S07E05,JERRY,"These people never fail. They sit in a room with a big clock all night long, just waitin' to make that call! (George comes in)"
S07E05,JEAN-PAUL,"No, I will stay with Elaine. It would be rude."
S07E05,GEORGE,"Hey, you bastards."
S07E05,JERRY,"Hey, how was the meeting?"
S07E05,GEORGE,I really like those sons of bitches.
S07E05,JERRY,Sons of bitches?
S07E05,GEORGE,"Yeah! That's how they talk. You know, everyone's either a bastard or a son of a bitch. Yeah, it's like uh...""boy, that son of a bitch Box can really hit, uh?!"" (laughs)"
S07E05,JEAN-PAUL,Really?!
S07E05,GEORGE,"Yeah, yeah. That's how they talk in the major league. (laughs)"
S07E05,KRAMER,Heeeeey...
S07E05,JERRY,How many sweaters you got on?
S07E05,KRAMER,"Oh...four. (to waitress) Yeah, could I have a cup o'tea? Boiling hot."
S07E05,GEORGE,What's goin'on?
S07E05,KRAMER,I fell asleep in the hot tub and the heat pump broke. Water went down to 58 degrees. I can't get my core temperature back up!
S07E05,JERRY,Your core temperature?
S07E05,KRAMER,"(to Jean-Paul) Here, feel my hand. (takes off glove) Yeah, feel."
S07E05,JEAN-PAUL,Phew... this son of a bitch is ice-cold. (smiles)
S07E05,GEORGE,Hello?
S07E05,CLAYTON,"uh...is that you, George?"
S07E05,GEORGE,"(laughs) Yeah, it's me. Is this Clayton?"
S07E05,CLAYTON,"Well listen, you son of a bitch! You know where we are? 30 000 feet above your head, you bastard! (the 3 laugh and howl)"
S07E05,GEORGE,What are they doin' lettin' you bastards on an airplane? Don't they know that's against FAA regulation?
S07E05,CLAYTON,"(to the other 2 men) Hey, hush up, now! I can't hear him!"
S07E05,GEORGE,Listen. I want you guys to send along those agreements the minute you land. Our boys can't wait to kick your butts!
S07E05,ZEKE,(to Clayton) When's that bastard comin' to Houston?
S07E05,CLAYTON,"Hey, Zeke wants to know when you Yankee bastards are comin' to Houston!"
S07E05,GEORGE,You tell that son of a bitch no Yankee is ever comin' to Houston. Not as long as you bastards are running things.
S07E05,CLAYTON,"Hey, uh, speak up, George, I can't hear ya!"
S07E05,GEORGE,(Mr.Wilhelm comes in and hears George yelling) You tell that son of a bitch no Yankee is ever comin' to Houston! Not as long as you bastards are running things!
S07E05,WILHELM,"George! George, get a hold of yourself!"
S07E05,GEORGE,Mr.Wilhelm...
S07E05,WILHELM,What's the matter with you?!
S07E05,GEORGE,Well I-I...
S07E05,ELAINE,"(thinking and typing) It was a cold winter's night in Timbuktu... (hits the keyboard) Oh! This stinks! (grabs a Himalayan walking shoe and starts squeezing it for inspiration) Oh, come on... come on...!...God! (quits)"
S07E05,JEAN-PAUL,Hello.
S07E05,JUDY,Hello.
S07E05,JEAN-PAUL,I'm a friend of Elaine's.
S07E05,JUDY,"Oh, hi."
S07E05,JEAN-PAUL,"(looks at the baby) oooooh...look at the cute little bastard... (the building manager comes in) you are mama's little bastard, aren't you? (laughs)"
S07E05,MANAGER,Whatta hell are you doin' harassing my tenants?
S07E05,JEAN-PAUL,"(smiling) Oh come on, you son of a bitch. I'm just trying to be friendly."
S07E05,MANAGER,"All right, that's it! (grabs Jean-Paul and gets him out) Let's go!"
S07E05,JEAN-PAUL,What...but I got a race tomorrow!
S07E05,GEORGE,Whoa...it's like a furnace in here!
S07E05,JERRY,Oh whatta hell is goin'on?!
S07E05,KRAMER,"Yeah, I turned up the heat."
S07E05,JERRY,Turn up the heat in your apartment! (opens a window)
S07E05,KRAMER,I'm freezin'! I just need to get my hot tub running. I'm waiting for my new heat pump.
S07E05,GEORGE,Well what's in this giant box out in the hall?
S07E05,KRAMER,Uh? Oh that must be it.
S07E05,GEORGE,It's huge!
S07E05,KRAMER,"Yeah, yeah, I got the biggest one they had. It's industrial strength. 16000 BTU's."
S07E05,JERRY,"Hello?...yeah, I can be there in 10 minutes...you can count on me! (hangs up)"
S07E05,GEORGE,(Jerry is going to his bedroom) What?
S07E05,JERRY,I got the call...!
S07E05,GEORGE,Jean-Paul?
S07E05,JERRY,(stops walking) Jean-Paul! (George acts like he scored)
S07E05,JERRY,"Pretty lucky to find this hotel, Jean-Paul."
S07E05,JEAN-PAUL,"Man, I just want to get some sleep. (gets into bed)"
S07E05,JERRY,"All right. (picks up the alarm clock) Let's check out the clock. Notch good... 650... volume check. (music playing, he starts swinging) What kinda music you wanna wake up to? Top 40, classical..."
S07E05,JEAN-PAUL,"Man, whatever! (annoyed)"
S07E05,JERRY,How about adult contemporary?
S07E05,JEAN-PAUL,"Fine, adult contemporary. Just pick one! (irritated)"
S07E05,JERRY,"All right...we're going with adult contempo... (puts alarm away, gets phone) now... the failsafe. The wake-up guy... (dials)"
S07E05,JEAN-PAUL,"Yes, yes, the wake-up guy."
S07E05,MAN,(on the phone) Front desk...?
S07E05,JERRY,"Yeah, this is room 419, I'd like a wake-up call for 650 AM tomorrow morning."
S07E05,MAN,Yes sir.
S07E05,JERRY,That's room 419. 650 AM. Four...one...niner...
S07E05,MAN,"Yes, I got it sir. You only had to say it once."
S07E05,JERRY,"I know, but it's a very important wake-up call... and I don't wanna take any chances."
S07E05,MAN,Every wake-up call I make is important. You're no more important than any of our guests.
S07E05,JERRY,"Well, I just...don't wanna get into a whole thing with you here..."
S07E05,MAN,Are you through? (annoyed)
S07E05,JERRY,"...Yeah I am, but I just...(man hangs-up)"
S07E05,JERRY,humm...
S07E05,JEAN-PAUL,What is it...?
S07E05,JERRY,I think I offended the wake-up guy...! (worried)
S07E05,JEAN-PAUL,"No, no."
S07E05,JERRY,"(gets up) No, no, I did. I think he's got it in for me!"
S07E05,JEAN-PAUL,"Man, he doesn't got ""in"" for you."
S07E05,JERRY,What if he doesn't call now out of spite?
S07E05,JEAN-PAUL,It is his job!
S07E05,JERRY,(pause) Not comfortable... (gets up again)
S07E05,JEAN-PAUL,For God's sake...! (gets up and they start packing)
S07E05,ELAINE,Jean-Paul? (searching everywhere) Hey Jean-Paul? Jean-Paul? (worried) Jean-Paul?! Oh man... (calling Jerry's) Oh...machine.
S07E05,JERRY'S MACHINE,"I'm not here, leave a message."
S07E05,ELAINE,"Jerry, Jerry, Jean-Paul's missing! He's alone in the city! Call me back. (hangs up)"
S07E05,ELAINE,"Judy, hi, listen..."
S07E05,JUDY,"You have got some nerve, Elaine! I told you about that baby in confidence!"
S07E05,ELAINE,Oh I didn't tell anyone.
S07E05,JUDY,Well your friend certainly seemed to know all about it. (shuts the door)
S07E05,ELAINE,... Jerry! (runs angry to her apartment)
S07E05,JERRY,"Feel much better here at my home base, Jean-Paul. It's a controlled environment."
S07E05,JEAN-PAUL,"It's a marathon, you know. 26 miles! I need to get some sleep! (lies on the sofa)"
S07E05,JERRY,"Hey, believe me, if I'd been with you there in Barcelona...you'd be polishing that medal right now. (covers Jean-Paul with a blanket)"
S07E05,JEAN-PAUL,Left a comfortable hotel bedroom for this!
S07E05,JERRY,"That wake-up guy was trouble! All right, I'll be right back. (goes knocking on Kramer's)"
S07E05,JERRY,(shouting) Man that thing is noisy!
S07E05,KRAMER,"(shouting) Yeah yeah, we're cracking along pretty good! We're almost up to 80 degrees!"
S07E05,JERRY,"Yeah, listen, do me a favor. Set your mental alarm for 630 and gimme a call."
S07E05,KRAMER,"Yeah, ok. Wait. (concentrates and makes the ""pop!"" sound) Done! (Jerry stares, confused)"
S07E05,JERRY,He's put his faith in you. He's put his faith in you.
S07E05,JEAN-PAUL,"I trust Elaine, she is my friend. I trust Elaine, she is my friend."
S07E05,JERRY,"Frankly, I'm a little concerned."
S07E05,ELAINE,"Ohhh, I'm exhausted. I've been on this street a thousand times! It's never looked so strange! The faces...so cold! In the distance, a child is crying. Fatherless...a bastard child, perhaps. My back aches...my heart aches...but my feet (stops to look at her feet) ...my feet are resilient! (a big smile grows in her face, as she thinks...) Thank God I took off my heels, and put on my... HIMALAYAN WALKING SHOES!!! (lifting her arms up in the air, in ecstasy, as she says...) Yes!"
S07E05,"(Two clocks at a table, both 4",02 AM. Jean-Paul's sleeping at the sofa)
S07E05,(4,02 AM. Kramer snores. The heat pump short circuits and blows the fuses on the entire building)
S07E05,"(Jerry wakes up with the sunlight. Looks at the electric clock, which stopped at 4",02)
S07E05,JERRY,402? (Checks his wristwatch) Aaa-aaahhh! Eight forty seven Jean-Paul! Wake up! Wake uuuuup!
S07E05,We gotta go! It's 8,47!
S07E05,JEAN-PAUL,847!? (jumps out of the sofa)
S07E05,JERRY,"Come on, just put your clothes on! You'll get dressed in the car!"
S07E05,JEAN-PAUL,Idiot! I trusted you!
S07E05,JERRY,"Kramer, what happened to the building?! The electricity went out!"
S07E05,KRAMER,"Yeah, the heat pump blew all the fuses!"
S07E05,JERRY,What happened to your mental alarm?!
S07E05,KRAMER,I guess I hit the snooze... (Jerry runs by Kramer and Kramer falls down)
S07E05,JERRY,"Make way! I've got-I've got a runner here! Get outta the way! Make way! Make way! Make way, it's a contender! (an event guard stops them)"
S07E05,GUAD,"Hey, hold it!"
S07E05,JEAN-PAUL,"I'm late, man, I'm in the race!"
S07E05,GUARD,Go ahead.
S07E05,JEAN-PAUL,"Thank you Jerry, you're a wonderful driver. Fantastic route, man!"
S07E05,JERRY,"All right, go, it's a race! Come on!"
S07E05,GEORGE,"You wanted to see me, Mr.Steinbrenner?"
S07E05,STEINBRENNER,"Yes, George, come in, come in. George, word up's you've been cracking under the pressure. Can't cope, can't stand the heat. Spit the bit."
S07E05,GEORGE,"Oh no, Mr.Steinbrenner, I can explain..."
S07E05,STEINBRENNER,"Oh we all get a little cuckoo sometimes George, I used to be like you. Rating personnel 'till they cried, calling managers on the field during a game, threatening to move the team to New Jersey, just to upset people. Then I found a way to relax. I've got two words to say to you, George hot tub. (George looks at him, puzzled)"
S07E05,JERRY,"I'm tellin'you, I never told anyone about that baby. I never even went near your building!"
S07E05,ELAINE,"Then how did she find out, Jerry?!"
S07E05,JERRY,Maybe you should check with the rabbi.
S07E05,KRAMER,(to Elaine) You want some hot tea?
S07E05,ELAINE,"Oh no, thank you."
S07E05,KRAMER,Oh. There's some runners. Here they come!
S07E05,ELAINE,There's Jean-Paul! He's up front! He's leading! (jumping) Go Jean-Paul!(starts screaming)
S07E05,KRAMER,Oh yeah! Yeah! Come on! (starts howling)
S07E05,JERRY,"Come on, let's go Jean-Paul!"
S07E05,ELAINE,Go Jean-Paaaaaul!
S07E05,STEINBRENNER,"How're you enjoying it, George? Melts that tension away, doesn't it? You gotta get that jet on the good spot. Oh. Oh. Uh. Uh. Yes, that feels good. Yes, that's real good. Oh yeah, that's where I keep all my tension. Right down to that chicken bone. Sometimes I get my wife to just stuck her thumb right in there like a screwdriver. Ya know, the Phillips head, not the flat one. Oh God, those flat ones frustrate me. You got it in, but it slips out. You put it in again, slips out again. You a single man, George?"
S07E05,GEORGE,"(bored to death) Well, I-I just recently uh..."
S07E05,STEINBRENNER,"I'll tell you, if you wanna get something wild goin'on in your life, you get a girl and bring her to one o'these things. Just like 4 shots a wild turkey. (laughs) She'll think you're Hopalong Cassidy. (George starts sliding, until he gets all his head -and glasses- under water, as Steinbrenner keeps talking) A show, about that Mickey Mantle, wasn't it? You know we used to talk. I don't think he liked me very much, you know."
S07E06,GEORGE,"All right. So, what theatre you wanna go to tonight? We got 61st and 3rd or 84th and Broadway."
S07E06,JERRY,Which one you wanna go to shmoopy?
S07E06,SHEILA,You called me shmoppy. You're a shmoopy.
S07E06,JERRY,You're a shmoopy!
S07E06,SHEILA,You're a shmoopy!
S07E06,JERRY,You're a shmoopy!
S07E06,GEORGE,"All right, shmoopies...what's it gonna be? Pick a theater."
S07E06,JERRY,"Uh,..we'll go to 3rd Avenue. So, can you come with us for lunch to the soup place?"
S07E06,SHEILA,No. You have a good lunch. But I'll meet you back here for the movie.
S07E06,GEORGE,Hey.
S07E06,ELAINE,Hey.
S07E06,SHEILA,Hi Elaine.
S07E06,ELAINE,Hi Sheila.
S07E06,JERRY,"All right, then. I'll see you later."
S07E06,SHEILA,Bye shmoopy.
S07E06,JERRY,Bye shmoopy.
S07E06,ELAINE,Okay. We ready to go?
S07E06,GEORGE,"Yes. Please. Please, let's go."
S07E06,ELAINE,"Boy, I'm in the mood for a cheeseburger."
S07E06,JERRY,No. We gotta go to the soup place.
S07E06,ELAINE,What soup place?
S07E06,GEORGE,"Oh, there's a soup stand, Kramer's been going there."
S07E06,JERRY,"He's always raving. I finally got a chance to go there the other day, and I tell you this, you will be stunned."
S07E06,ELAINE,Stunned by soup?
S07E06,JERRY,"You can't eat this soup standing up, your knees buckle."
S07E06,ELAINE,Huh. All right. Come on.
S07E06,JERRY,"There's only one caveat -- the guy who runs the place is a little temperamental, especially about the ordering procedure. He's secretly referred to as the Soup Nazi."
S07E06,ELAINE,Why? What happens if you don't order right?
S07E06,JERRY,He yells and you don't get your soup.
S07E06,ELAINE,What?
S07E06,JERRY,Just follow the ordering procedure and you will be fine.
S07E06,GEORGE,All right. All right. Let's - let's go over that again.
S07E06,JERRY,All right. As you walk in the place move immediately to your right.
S07E06,ELAINE,What?
S07E06,JERRY,The main thing is to keep the line moving.
S07E06,GEORGE,"All right. So, you hold out your money, speak your soup in a loud, clear voice, step to the left and receive."
S07E06,JERRY,Right. It's very important not to embellish on your order. No extraneous comments. No questions. No compliments.
S07E06,ELAINE,"Oh, boy, I'm really scared!"
S07E06,JERRY,Elaine.
S07E06,ELAINE,"All right. Jerry, that's enough now about the Soup Nazi. Whoa! Wow! Look at this. You know what this is? This is an antique armoire. Wow! It's French. Armoire."
S07E06,JERRY,Ar-moire.
S07E06,ELAINE,How much is this?
S07E06,FURNITURE GUY,"I was asking 250, but you got a nice face. 2 even."
S07E06,ELAINE,"Huh? Ha. 200. You know, I've always wanted one of these things."
S07E06,JERRY,He gave you the nice face discount.
S07E06,ELAINE,Yeah. All right. You guys go ahead.
S07E06,JERRY,What about the soup?
S07E06,ELAINE,"I'm getting an armoire, Jerry."
S07E06,JERRY,[in French accent] Pardon.
S07E06,GEORGE,This line is huge.
S07E06,JERRY,It's like this all the time.
S07E06,GEORGE,Isn't that that Bania guy?
S07E06,JERRY,"Oh, no. It is. Just be still."
S07E06,GEORGE,Whoop! Too late. I think he picked up the scent.
S07E06,BANIA,"Hey, Jerry! I didn't know you liked soup."
S07E06,JERRY,Hard to believe.
S07E06,BANIA,"This guy makes the best soup in the city, Jerry. The best. You know what they call him? Soup Nazi."
S07E06,JERRY,"Shhhhh! All right, Bania, I - I'm not letting you cut in line."
S07E06,BANIA,Why not?
S07E06,JERRY,"Because if he catches us, we'll never be able to get soup again."
S07E06,BANIA,Okay. Okay.
S07E06,GEORGE,Medium turkey chili.
S07E06,JERRY,Medium crab bisque.
S07E06,GEORGE,I didn't get any bread.
S07E06,JERRY,Just forget it. Let it go.
S07E06,GEORGE,"Um, excuse me, I - I think you forgot my bread."
S07E06,SOUP NAZI,Bread -- $2 extra.
S07E06,GEORGE,$2? But everyone in front of me got free bread.
S07E06,SOUP NAZI,You want bread?
S07E06,GEORGE,"Yes, please."
S07E06,SOUP NAZI,$3!
S07E06,GEORGE,What?
S07E06,SOUP NAZI,No soup for you! [snaps fingers]
S07E06,ELAINE,What do you mean I can't bring in here? I live here.
S07E06,SUPER,"Its Sunday, Elaine. There's no moving on Sunday. That's the rule."
S07E06,ELAINE,"But I didn't know, Tom. I g -- can't you just make an exception? Please. I've got a nice face."
S07E06,SUPER,"Tomorrow, okay? You can move it in tommorrow. I'll even give you a hand, all right?"
S07E06,ELAINE,"Ohh! Well, you're just gonna have to hold this for me."
S07E06,FURNITURE GUY,I'm a guy on the sidewalk. I don't have layaway.
S07E06,ELAINE,"Oh, no...please don't go. Please - please don't walk away."
S07E06,JERRY,"Oh, man. Ohh! This is fantastic. How does he do it?"
S07E06,GEORGE,"You know, I don't see how you can sit there eating that and not even offer me any?"
S07E06,JERRY,I gave you a taste. What do you want?
S07E06,GEORGE,Why can't we share?
S07E06,JERRY,"I told you not to say anything. You can't go in there, brazenly flaunt the rules and then think I'm gonna share with you!"
S07E06,GEORGE,Do you hear yourself?
S07E06,JERRY,I'm sorry. This is what comes from living under a Nazi regime.
S07E06,GEORGE,"Well, I gotta go back there and try again. Hi Sheila."
S07E06,SHEILA,Hi. Hi shmoopy.
S07E06,JERRY,Hi shmoopy.
S07E06,SHEILA,"No, you're a shmoopy!"
S07E06,JERRY,You're a shmoopy!
S07E06,GEORGE,I'm going.
S07E06,JERRY,"Hey, listen, so we'll meet you and Susan at the movie tonight?"
S07E06,GEORGE,"You know what? I changed my mind. I, uh, I don't think so."
S07E06,JERRY,Why?
S07E06,GEORGE,I just don't feel like it anymore.
S07E06,JERRY,Just like that?
S07E06,GEORGE,Just like that.
S07E06,SHEILA,"Boy, he's a weird guy, isn't he?"
S07E06,KRAMER,Hey.
S07E06,JERRY,Hey.
S07E06,KRAMER,[taking Jerry's couch cushion] Yeah.
S07E06,JERRY,Hey. Hey. Hey. Hey. Hey. Hey. Hey. Wha -- what are you doing?
S07E06,KRAMER,"Yeah. Elaine, she has to leave her armoire on the street all night...I'm gonna guard it for her. I need something to sit on."
S07E06,JERRY,"Well, sit on one of your couch cushions."
S07E06,KRAMER,"Yeah, but this is so nice and thick. Ahoy there!"
S07E06,ELAINE,"Oh, Kramer! Thank God. I really appreciate you doing this."
S07E06,KRAMER,"Yeah. Well, you ask for it, you got it."
S07E06,ELAINE,Do you need anything?
S07E06,KRAMER,"Well, a bowl of muligatawny would hit the spot."
S07E06,ELAINE,Mulligatawny?
S07E06,KRAMER,Yeah. It's an Indian soup. It's simmered to perfection by one of the great soup artisans in the modern era.
S07E06,ELAINE,Oh! Who? The Soup Nazi?
S07E06,KRAMER,He's not a Nazi. He just happens to be a little eccentric. Most geniuses are.
S07E06,ELAINE,All right. I'll be back.
S07E06,KRAMER,Wait a second. You don't even know how to order.
S07E06,ELAINE,"Oh, no. No. No. No. I got it."
S07E06,KRAMER,"No. No, Elaine!"
S07E06,ELAINE,"Hey, I got it. Hey. Didn't you already get soup?"
S07E06,GEORGE,No. I didn't get it.
S07E06,ELAINE,Why? What happened?
S07E06,GEORGE,I made a mistake.
S07E06,ELAINE,[laughing]
S07E06,GEORGE,"All right. Well, we'll see what happens to you."
S07E06,ELAINE,"Yeah. No. Listen, George, I am quite certain I'm walking out of there with a bowl of soup."
S07E06,GEORGE,"Yeah. Hey, let ask you something. Is it just me, or - or do you find it unbearable to be around Jerry and that girl?"
S07E06,ELAINE,"Oh, I know! It is awful!"
S07E06,GEORGE,Why do they have to do that in front of people?
S07E06,ELAINE,I don't know.
S07E06,GEORGE,What is that with the shmoopy?
S07E06,ELAINE,Ohh!
S07E06,GEORGE,"The shmoopy, shmoopy, shmoopy, shmmopy, shmoopy!"
S07E06,ELAINE,Ohh! Stop it! I know.
S07E06,GEORGE,I had to listen to a five minute discussion on which one is actually called shmoopy.
S07E06,ELAINE,Ugh!
S07E06,GEORGE,And I cancelled plans to go to the movies with them tonight.
S07E06,ELAINE,"You know, we should say something."
S07E06,GEORGE,"You know, we absolutely should."
S07E06,ELAINE,"I mean, why does he do that? Doesn't he know what a huge turnoff that is?"
S07E06,GEORGE,I don't know. He can be so weird sometimes.
S07E06,ELAINE,Yeah.
S07E06,GEORGE,I still haven't figured him out.
S07E06,ELAINE,No. Me neither.
S07E06,GEORGE,All right. Shh! I gotta focus. I'm shifting into soup mode.
S07E06,ELAINE,"Oh, God!"
S07E06,GEORGE,Good afternoon. One large crab bisque to go. Bread. Beautiful.
S07E06,SOUP NAZI,You're pushing your luck little man.
S07E06,GEORGE,Sorry. Thank you.
S07E06,ELAINE,"Hi there. Um, uh -- [drumming on countertop] Oh! Oh! Oh! One mulligatawny and, um.... what is that right there? Is that lima bean?"
S07E06,SOUP NAZI,Yes.
S07E06,ELAINE,"Never been a big fan. [coughing] Um..you know what? Has anyone ever told you you look exactly like Al Pacino? You know, "" Scent Of A Woman."" Who-ah! Who-ah!"
S07E06,SOUP NAZI,Very good. Very good.
S07E06,ELAINE,"Well, I --"
S07E06,SOUP NAZI,You know something?
S07E06,ELAINE,Hmmm?
S07E06,SOUP NAZI,No soup for you!
S07E06,ELAINE,What?
S07E06,SOUP NAZI,Come back one year! Next!
S07E06,RAY,Look at this.
S07E06,BOB,It's an antique.
S07E06,RAY,It's all hand made and I love the in-lay.
S07E06,BOB,"Yes. Yes. me, too. Ay, it's gorgeous. Completely. Pick it up. No. No. Pick it up from the bottom over there."
S07E06,KRAMER,Wait. Wait. Wait. Wait. What are you doing?
S07E06,BOB,What does it look like we're doing? We're taking this.
S07E06,KRAMER,You can't take this. This belongs to a friend of mine.
S07E06,BOB,"Look, you wanna get hurt?"
S07E06,KRAMER,Huh?
S07E06,BOB,"I don't think you wanna get hurt. Because if you wanna get hurt I can hurt you. Now, just back off."
S07E06,RAY,Bob.
S07E06,BOB,Just pick it up.
S07E06,KRAMER,"What is this, huh?"
S07E06,BOB,You have some kind of problem here? What is it you not understanding? We taking the armoire and that's all there is to it. Okay?
S07E06,ELAINE,"I mean, is he allowed to do this? It's discrimination! I'm gonna call the states' attorney office. I really am."
S07E06,GEORGE,"Oh, this is fabulous. My God Elaine, you have to taste this."
S07E06,ELAINE,"All right. All right. Give me a tsate. Mmm! Oh God, I gotta sit down. What happened? Where's my armoire?"
S07E06,KRAMER,"Well, b -- it was stolen."
S07E06,ELAINE,Wha--?
S07E06,KRAMER,"These street toughs, they robbed me."
S07E06,ELAINE,Street toughs took my armoire?
S07E06,KRAMER,Yeah. It was very frightening. My life was in danger. You should've seen the way they talked to me.
S07E06,ELAINE,I can't believe this!
S07E06,KRAMER,"Well, where's the soup?"
S07E06,ELAINE,Wha -- the Soup Nazi threw me out.
S07E06,KRAMER,Oh...yeah!
S07E06,JERRY,What are you gonna get?
S07E06,SHEILA,I'll decide at the last minute.
S07E06,JERRY,"You better decide, sister. You're on deck. Sheila!"
S07E06,JERRY,Uh-oh.
S07E06,SOUP NAZI,"Hey, what is this? You're kissing in my line? Nobody kisses in my line!"
S07E06,SHEILA,I can kiss anywhere I want to.
S07E06,SOUP NAZI,You just cost yourself a soup!
S07E06,SHEILA,"How dare you? Come on, Jerry, we're leaving. Jerry?"
S07E06,JERRY,Do I know you?
S07E06,ELAINE,"So, essentially, you chose soup over a woman?"
S07E06,JERRY,It was a bisque.
S07E06,ELAINE,"Yeah. You know what I just realized? Suddenly, George has become much more normal than you."
S07E06,JERRY,Really?
S07E06,ELAINE,"Yeah. Come on. I mean, think about it. He's engaged to be married. Your top priority is soup."
S07E06,JERRY,Have you tastes the soup?
S07E06,ELAINE,Yeah. All right. You made the right decision.
S07E06,JERRY,"See, the way I figure it, it's much easier to patch things up with Sheila than with the Soup Nazi."
S07E06,JERRY,Hey.
S07E06,KRAMER,Yeah.
S07E06,ELAINE,Hey.
S07E06,KRAMER,Yeah.
S07E06,JERRY,"Oh, thanks."
S07E06,ELAINE,There he is.
S07E06,KRAMER,"Elaine, I'm really sorry about the armoire."
S07E06,ELAINE,"Yeah. I know. Me, too."
S07E06,JERRY,"So, did these thieves want any money?"
S07E06,KRAMER,No.
S07E06,JERRY,They just wanted the armoire?
S07E06,KRAMER,Yeah. They were..quite taken with it.
S07E06,JERRY,Yeah?
S07E06,GEORGE,Hup! Hup!
S07E06,JERRY,"Hey, have you noticed George is acting a little strange lately?"
S07E06,ELAINE,No. In what way?
S07E06,JERRY,"I don't know. A lot of attitude, like he's better than me, or something."
S07E06,ELAINE,I don't think George has ever thought he's better than anybody.
S07E06,GEORGE,Hello.
S07E06,JERRY,Hello.
S07E06,KRAMER,Hey.
S07E06,GEORGE,Hello.
S07E06,ELAINE,Hello.
S07E06,GEORGE,Were you just talking about me? What's going on?
S07E06,JERRY,Absolutely not.
S07E06,GEORGE,Something's going on here.
S07E06,KRAMER,"All right, [claps hands] I'm gonna go get some soup."
S07E06,ELAINE,One of these days that guy is gonna get his.
S07E06,GEORGE,"So, how was the movie?"
S07E06,JERRY,"Aw, we didn't go. Sheila and I are kind of on the outs."
S07E06,GEORGE,"Oh, yeah?"
S07E06,JERRY,"Yeah. Wha - wha - what are you, happy?"
S07E06,GEORGE,Happy? Why should I be happy?
S07E06,JERRY,"I don't know, but you look like you're happy."
S07E06,GEORGE,Why should I care?
S07E06,JERRY,"You can't fool me. Don't insult me, George because I know when you're happy."
S07E06,GEORGE,"All right. I am happy, and I'll tell ya why -- because the two of you were making me and every one of your friends sick! Right, Elaine?"
S07E06,JERRY,Is that so?
S07E06,GEORGE,"Yeah. Yeah. With all that kissing and the shmoopy, shmoopy, shmoopy, shmoopy, shmoopy out in public like that. It's disgusting!"
S07E06,JERRY,Disgusting?
S07E06,GEORGE,People who do that should be arrested.
S07E06,JERRY,"Well, I guess I have all the more reason to get back with her."
S07E06,GEORGE,"Ye - yeah. And we had a pact, you know."
S07E06,JERRY,What?
S07E06,GEORGE,You shook my hand in that coffee shop.
S07E06,JERRY,You're still with the pact?
S07E06,GEORGE,Mmm-hmm. You reneged.
S07E06,JERRY,All I did was shake your hand.
S07E06,GEORGE,Ah-ha!
S07E06,KRAMER,"And then they just ran off with the armoire, just like that."
S07E06,SOUP NAZI,Ohh! This city.
S07E06,NEWMAN,"One large jambalaya, please."
S07E06,SOUP NAZI,"So, continue."
S07E06,KRAMER,"Well, my friend is awful disappointed is all. You know, she's very emotional."
S07E06,NEWMAN,Thank you. [inhaling deeply] Jambalaya!
S07E06,SOUP NAZI,"All right, now listen to me. You have been a good friend. I have an armoire in my basement. If you want to pick it up, you're welcome to it. So, take it, it's yours."
S07E06,KRAMER,How can I possibly thank you?
S07E06,SOUP NAZI,You are the only one who understands me.
S07E06,KRAMER,You suffer for your soup.
S07E06,SOUP NAZI,Yes. That is right.
S07E06,KRAMER,"You demand perfection from yourself, from your soup."
S07E06,SOUP NAZI,How can I tolerate any less from my customer?
S07E06,CUSTOMER,"Uh, gazpacho, por favor."
S07E06,SOUP NAZI,Por favor?
S07E06,CUSTOMER,"Um, I'm part Spanish."
S07E06,SOUP NAZI,Adios muchacho!
S07E06,KRAMER,Git.
S07E06,JERRY,It was stupid of me.
S07E06,SHEILA,"Well, it was very insulting."
S07E06,JERRY,No. I know. I - I was really sort of half-kidding.
S07E06,SHEILA,"Well, behind every joke there's some truth."
S07E06,JERRY,"What about that Bavarian cream pie joke I told you? There's no truth to that. Nobody with a terminal illness goes from the United States to Europe for a piece of Bavarian cream pie and then when they get there and they don't have it he says "" Aw, I'll just have some coffee."" There's no truth to that."
S07E06,SHEILA,"Well, I guess you're right."
S07E06,JERRY,"So, am I forgiven, shmoopy?"
S07E06,SHEILA,"Yes, shmoopy."
S07E06,JERRY,Aw!
S07E06,SUSAN,"Hey, Jerry!"
S07E06,JERRY,"Oh, hi Susan, George. You remember Sheila."
S07E06,GEORGE,"Oh, yes. Hello."
S07E06,SHEILA,Hello. Won't you join us?
S07E06,GEORGE,"No, thanks."
S07E06,SUSAN,Of course.
S07E06,GEORGE,"Yes. Well -- So, uh, sit on the same side at a booth, huh?"
S07E06,JERRY,Yeah. That's right. You got a problem?
S07E06,GEORGE,"I, uh, just think it's a little unusual. Two people to sit on one side...and leave the other side empty."
S07E06,JERRY,"Well, we're changing the rules."
S07E06,GEORGE,Ahh. Good for you.
S07E06,SUSAN,"Aw, what are you getting George?"
S07E06,GEORGE,"I don't know, honey. What do you want to get? [in babying voice] I want you to get anything you want...'cause I love you so much. I want you to be happy. Okay, sweetie?"
S07E06,SUSAN,"Oh, George, you're so sweet."
S07E06,GEORGE,"Well, I could be a little sweetie tweetie weetie weetie."
S07E06,SUSAN,Aww!
S07E06,JERRY,"What about you, shmoopy? How 'bout a little tuna? You want a little tuna fishy?"
S07E06,SHEILA,Yeah.
S07E06,JERRY,Yum yum little tuna fishy?
S07E06,GEORGE,Come here.
S07E06,KRAMER,And..voila!
S07E06,ELAINE,[gasps]
S07E06,KRAMER,Yeah.
S07E06,ELAINE,"Oh! Oh, I love it! I absolutely love it!"
S07E06,KRAMER,Yeah. Did the K Man do it or did the K Man do it?
S07E06,ELAINE,The K Man did it!
S07E06,KRAMER,Yeah!
S07E06,ELAINE,[laughing] How much did you pay for this thing?
S07E06,KRAMER,How 'bout zero?
S07E06,ELAINE,What?
S07E06,KRAMER,Yeah.
S07E06,ELAINE,What? Who's was it? Where'd you get it?
S07E06,KRAMER,I'll tell ya where I got it. I got it from the guy you so callously refer to as the Soup Nazi.
S07E06,ELAINE,Get out!
S07E06,ELAINE,The Soup Nazi gave it to you?
S07E06,KRAMER,Yeah.
S07E06,ELAINE,Why?
S07E06,KRAMER,"Well, I told him the whole story and he just let me have it. Wha -- Yeah. He's a wonderful man."
S07E06,ELAINE,[gasps]
S07E06,KRAMER,"Yeah. Well, a little bit misunderstood but, uh...."
S07E06,ELAINE,"Well, I'm just gonna go down there and personally thank him. I mean, I had this guy all wrong. This is wonderful!"
S07E06,KRAMER,"Yeah. Well, he's a dear."
S07E06,GEORGE,How much tip do you leave on $8.15?
S07E06,SUSAN,"You know sweetie, I just want you to know that I was so proud of you today expressing your feelings so freely in front of Jerry and all. Just knowing that you're not afraid of those things is such a great step forward in our relationship."
S07E06,GEORGE,Huh?
S07E06,SUSAN,[in babying voice] Because you love your little kiki don't you?
S07E06,CUSTOMER,How is he today?
S07E06,BANIA,I think he's in a good mood.
S07E06,ELAINE,"Hi. You know, Kramer gave me the armoire and it is so beautiful. I'm mean, I just can't tell you how much I appreciate it."
S07E06,SOUP NAZI,"You? If I knew it was for you, I never would have given it to him in the first place! I would have taken a hatchet and smashed it to pieces! Now, who wants soup? Next! Speak up!"
S07E06,JERRY,I'm heading over to Elaine's.
S07E06,KRAMER,"Oh. Jerry, those are the guys that mugged me for the armoire."
S07E06,JERRY,Those two?
S07E06,KRAMER,Yeah.
S07E06,JERRY,Are you sure?
S07E06,KRAMER,Yeah. That's them.
S07E06,JERRY,"Well, let's confront 'em."
S07E06,KRAMER,No. No. No. No. Let's get a cop.
S07E06,JERRY,There's no cops around. They're gonna leave. Come on.
S07E06,KRAMER,No!
S07E06,JERRY,Let's go.
S07E06,BOB,"Oh, wow look, that one is gorgeous. I would just kill for that one."
S07E06,RAY,"Oh, not in blue. Blue does not go with all."
S07E06,BOB,"Oh, please. Do you know what you're talking about? Because I don't think you know what you're talking about. Take a look at that."
S07E06,KRAMER,Excuse me.
S07E06,RAY,Are you talking to me?
S07E06,KRAMER,"Uh, well, uh, we --"
S07E06,RAY,"I said, are you talking to me?"
S07E06,BOB,"Well, maybe, he was talking to me. Was you talking to him? Because you was obviously talking to one of us. So what is it? Who?! Who was you talking to?!"
S07E06,KRAMER,"Well, wha -- I, uh -- uh, we were kind of, uh, talking to each other, weren't we?"
S07E06,ELAINE,"I mean, you know, I've never been so insulted in my entire life. There's something really wrong with this man. He is a Soup Nazi. What? What is that?"
S07E06,JERRY,"I don't know. "" 5 cups chopped Porcine mushrooms, half a cup of olive oil, 3 pounds of celery, chopped parsley..."""
S07E06,ELAINE,"Let me see this. [gasps] You know what this is? This is a recipe for soup, and look at this. There are like thirty different recipes. These are his recipes!"
S07E06,JERY,So?
S07E06,ELAINE,"So? So, his secret's out. Don't you see? I could give these to every restaurant in town. I could have 'em published! I could - I could drop fliers from a plane above the city."
S07E06,JERRY,"Wait a second, Elaine. Where do you think you're going?"
S07E06,ELAINE,What do you care?
S07E06,JERRY,"Elaine, I don't want you causing any trouble down at that soup stand. I happen to love that soup."
S07E06,ELAINE,"Get out of my way, Jerry."
S07E06,JERRY,"Elaine, let the man make his soup!"
S07E06,ELAINE,"Don't make me hurt you, Jerry."
S07E06,SUSAN,"Look, they have it in blue...for my baby bluey. Are you my baby bluey?"
S07E06,GEORGE,"Oh, yes. I - I'm your baby bluey."
S07E06,JERRY,Well. Well.
S07E06,SUSAN,"Hi, Jerry."
S07E06,JERRY,"Hey, Susan, George."
S07E06,SUSAN,"You know, I really like Sheila a lot."
S07E06,JERRY,"Oh, really?"
S07E06,SUSAN,Mmm-hmm.
S07E06,JERRY,Because we're kind of not seeing each other anymore.
S07E06,SUSAN,"Oh, no! That's too bad."
S07E06,JERRY,"Yeah. Well, she was very affectionate - which I love. You know I love that - but mentally, we couldn't quite make the connection."
S07E06,GEORGE,Really?
S07E06,JERRY,"Yeah. Too bad, 'cause you gotta have the affection - which you obviously have. I think it's great that you're so open with your affections in public. See, we had that."
S07E06,SUSAN,Mmm-hmm.
S07E06,GEORGE,You did?
S07E06,JERRY,"Oh, yeah. But the mental thing. But anyway. I'll see ya."
S07E06,GEORGE,Yeah. See ya.
S07E06,SOUP NAZI,Go on! Leave! Get out!
S07E06,WOMAN,But I didn't do anything.
S07E06,SOUP NAZI,Next!
S07E06,ELAINE,Hello.
S07E06,SOUP NAZI,You. You think you can get soup? Please. You're wasting everyone's time.
S07E06,ELAINE,"I don't want soup. I can make my own soup. "" 5 cups chopped Porcine mushrooms, half a cup of olive oil, 3 pounds celery."""
S07E06,SOUP NAZI,That is my recipe for wild mushroom.
S07E06,ELAINE,"Yeah, that's right. I got 'em all. Cold cucumber, corn and crab chowder, mulligatawny."
S07E06,SOUP NAZI,Mulliga...tawny?
S07E06,ELAINE,You're through Soup Nazi. Pack it up. No more soup for you. Next!
S07E06,NEWMAN,[panting] Jerry! Jerry! Jerry!
S07E06,JERRY,What is it?
S07E06,NEWMAN,Something's happened with the Soup Nazi!
S07E06,JERRY,Wha - wha - what's the matter?
S07E06,NEWMAN,"Elaine's down there causing all kinds of commotion. Somehow she got a hold of his recipes and she says she's gonna drive him out of business! The Soup Nazi said that now that his recipes are out, he's not gonna make anymore soup! He's moving out of the country, moving to Argentina! No more soup, Jerry! No more for of us!"
S07E06,JERRY,"Well, where are you going?"
S07E06,NEWMAN,He's giving away what's left! I gotta go home and get a big pot!
S07E07,SUSAN,"Hey, I gotta get some cash, I'm gonna run down to the ATM."
S07E07,GEORGE,"Yeah, I better grab some too."
S07E07,SUSAN,I'll get it for you; just give me your card.
S07E07,GEORGE,You sure?
S07E07,SUSAN,"Yeah, just tell me your code."
S07E07,GEORGE,My code?
S07E07,JERRY,So why didn't you tell her the code?
S07E07,GEORGE,No. No way.
S07E07,JERRY,"George, you're gonna marry this woman. Most likely."
S07E07,GEORGE,"It says very clearly, 'for your protection, do not give your secret code to anyone.'"
S07E07,JERRY,So you're taking relationship advice from Chemical Bank now?
S07E07,GEORGE,Why does everything have to be 'us'? Is there no 'me' left? Why can't there be some things just for me? Is that so selfish?
S07E07,JERRY,"Actually, that's the definition of selfish."
S07E07,GEORGE,Have you ever given your code to anyone?
S07E07,JERRY,No one's ever asked. You want it? It's 'Jor-El.'
S07E07,GEORGE,Superman's father on Krypton.
S07E07,JERRY,"Of course. C'mon Georgie, you wanna tell me. It's eating you up inside. Sing it, sister."
S07E07,GEORGE,No. I am not giving my code to anyone for any reason.
S07E07,JERRY,What if my life depended on it?
S07E07,GEORGE,"If you're in some situation where some fast cash will save your life, I'll give you the code."
S07E07,GEORGE,What's the matter with your leg?
S07E07,JERRY,My foot fell asleep.
S07E07,GEORGE,How'd your foot fall asleep?
S07E07,JERRY,"I crossed my legs, I forgot to alternate."
S07E07,FRED,Hey Jerry.
S07E07,JERRY,Hey Fred.
S07E07,GEORGE,Hey Fred.
S07E07,JERRY,My foot fell asleep.
S07E07,FRED,"You're lucky, at least you got something to do."
S07E07,JERRY,"Fred, do you know Elaine?"
S07E07,FRED,"No, it's nice to meet you. Well, I'm outta here, see you guys."
S07E07,GEORGE,"Alright, bye."
S07E07,JERRY,Seeya.
S07E07,ELAINE,"Did you hear that? He said, 'nice to meet you.'"
S07E07,JERRY,So?
S07E07,ELAINE,"So? We've met before. At Katie Ash's party, we talked for like ten minutes."
S07E07,JERRY,And he didn't remember you?
S07E07,JERRY,"Where are you going, you just got here?"
S07E07,ELAINE,I gotta go talk to him.
S07E07,ELAINE,"Excuse me, excuse me, Fred?"
S07E07,FRED,Yeah?
S07E07,ELAINE,"You just said, 'nice to meet you', but actually we've met before."
S07E07,FRED,We have?
S07E07,ELAINE,"Yeah, at Katie Ash's party?"
S07E07,FRED,What was your name again?
S07E07,ELAINE,Elaine. You don't remember our conversation? I talked about how my uncle worked in the book depository building with Lee Harvey Oswald?
S07E07,FRED,Not ringing a bell.
S07E07,ELAINE,"When my uncle said to him, 'the president's been shot' Oswald winked at him and said, 'I'm gonna go catch a movie'?"
S07E07,FRED,"Mmm, no."
S07E07,ELAINE,That was right when we were in front of the bathroom door.
S07E07,FRED,"The bathroom door. I remember someone had played tic-tac-toe on it, and the X's won; they went diagonally from the top left to the bottom right."
S07E07,JERRY,"Hey that sounds great, I'd love to do some TV commercials, that should really be fun."
S07E07,JERRY,"Uh huh, okay, alright, bye. Huh, how do you like that? I'm gonna do some TV spots for Leapin' Larry's Appliance Store. That was Leapin' Larry himself, I'm gonna meet with him tomorrow."
S07E07,KRAMER,"Leapin' Larry! Yeah, that's where I bought this."
S07E07,JERRY,What is that?
S07E07,KRAMER,"Well, it's an emergency band scanner, it picks up everything Fires, harbor patrol, even the police. I'm watching the watchers, Jerry. Uh oh, we got a big fire on 115th. I tell ya if could do it over again, I'd give it all up to be a fireman."
S07E07,JERRY,"Yeah, those civil servants who risk their lives really got it made."
S07E07,KRAMER,"When I was a kid, all I ever dreamed of was steering the back of that big hook and ladder."
S07E07,JERRY,You're lucky they let you drive a car.
S07E07,KRAMER,"No no no, they're talking the West Side Highway, at this time of day that's insane. They're heading straight into gridlock. Oh, those fools."
S07E07,ELAINE,What was that?
S07E07,JERRY,(waving his arm in dismissal) Eh.
S07E07,ELAINE,"Alright. So, get a load of this. This guy, Fred Yerkes, remembers every little thing about that night except me."
S07E07,JERRY,"Really? I'm surprised, he doesn't meet that many women."
S07E07,ELAINE,What are you saying?
S07E07,JERRY,"Well, what's to be said? He didn't remember you."
S07E07,ELAINE,"Yeah, but why? I mean, ya know."
S07E07,JERRY,I know.
S07E07,ELAINE,Ya know?
S07E07,JERRY,"Yeah, I know."
S07E07,ELAINE,"Huh, lookit, you got the new catalog."
S07E07,JERRY,"Yeah, you wrote a good piece on the Himalayan Walking Shoe."
S07E07,ELAINE,"Too good. Peterman was so pleased, now he wants to take me out to dinner tomorrow. Maybe you wanna come with me."
S07E07,JERRY,Why would I wanna do that?
S07E07,ELAINE,"Oh please, Jerry, please please please, I can't sit with him, he tells these stories, it's gonna be awful."
S07E07,JERRY,"Yeah, sounds like fun."
S07E07,SUSAN,"I want you to tell me, George."
S07E07,GEORGE,Why? Why is my code so important?
S07E07,SUSAN,"Because, it's part of our relationship, it's an indication of trust. We're not supposed to keep secrets from one another."
S07E07,GEORGE,Well I'm sure you have secrets from me. I don't know anything about your cycles.
S07E07,SUSAN,My cycles?
S07E07,GEORGE,"Yeah, I never know what's going on there."
S07E07,SUSAN,Well from now on I'll keep you apprised of my cycles.
S07E07,GEORGE,Please.
S07E07,SUSAN,Anything else?
S07E07,GEORGE,We're out of Bosco!
S07E07,JERRY,"Howbout this, come one down to Leapin' Parry's if you can beat our prices, we'll give you the store."
S07E07,LEAPIN' LARRY,"Ya know I've always liked your comedy, you don't take cheap shots."
S07E07,JERRY,No I don't.
S07E07,LEAPIN' LARRY,"Sorry for keeping you here so long. Again, I apologize for the mess. This renovation is killing me."
S07E07,JERRY,(to himself) My foot's asleep again!
S07E07,LEAPIN' LARRY,"When I lost my leg in the boating accident, I got so depressed about this damn prosthetic I thought I was gonna have to give up the business. But now I'm rejuvenated. Let me show you around the store."
S07E07,JERRY,You know what? I'll be with you in a minute.
S07E07,EMPLOYEE,That is a great impression!
S07E07,JERRY,"Larry, wait, you don't understand!"
S07E07,KRAMER,"I just came from Leapin' Larry's. Making fun of crippled people, is that what you've sunk to?"
S07E07,JERRY,"I didn't do it on purpose, my foot fell asleep."
S07E07,KRAMER,"Oh, oh your foot fell asleep."
S07E07,JERRY,"Ya know, the guy has one leg and he still calls himself Leapin' Larry, you'd think he had a sense of humor about it."
S07E07,KRAMER,"Well, you just joked yourself right out of that commercial, didn't you, munjamba?"
S07E07,JERRY,Yup.
S07E07,VOICE,Hup.
S07E07,KRAMER,"Boy, look at that. Se that's that fire I was listening to yesterday."
S07E07,JERRY,"Wow, the whole building burned down."
S07E07,KRAMER,They just don't know what street to take. You remember that time I got us to Yankee Stadium in rush hour in fifteen minutes?
S07E07,JERRY,Of course.
S07E07,KRAMER,"It's all up here, Jerry. All up here. It's innate."
S07E07,JERRY,The amazing thing is you never have any place to go.
S07E07,GEORGE,Where we gonna eat?
S07E07,JERRY,We're gonna meet Elaine and Peterman at the Chinese place.
S07E07,GEORGE,Peterman? Nobody mentioned anything about Peterman.
S07E07,JERRY,"Of course not, if I did would you have gone?"
S07E07,GEORGE,No way.
S07E07,JERRY,There you go.
S07E07,GEORGE,"I don't even know Peterman. How the hell am I gonna relax? I'm gonna have to be on all night. I don't like being on, Jerry, I would much rather be off."
S07E07,JERRY,"Trust me, you're off."
S07E07,ELAINE,"Oh, hi Fred."
S07E07,FRED,"Um, hello?"
S07E07,ELAINE,It's Elaine.
S07E07,FRED,"Oh yeah, yeah, right."
S07E07,ELAINE,How ya doin'?
S07E07,FRED,"I'm depressed. I got this new shirt, the button fell off. Once the button falls off, that's it. I'll never fix it."
S07E07,ELAINE,"Yeah, that's too bad."
S07E07,FRED,"Yeah, I'm gonna get some vitamins, I feel depleted."
S07E07,ELAINE,Hmm. I never take them.
S07E07,FRED,"Cause they make you nauseous, right?"
S07E07,ELAINE,"Yeah! Yeah, that's right, you remembered!"
S07E07,FRED,Do you wanna have dinner tonight?
S07E07,ELAINE,Hmm. Tonight.
S07E07,FRED,"What, you have other plans?"
S07E07,ELAINE,"No, no no no, none that I can, um, remember."
S07E07,JERRY,"...Alright, you're locked up in a prison in Turkey, I have your wallet. The only way I can bribe the guards to get you out is for you to give me your ATM code."
S07E07,GEORGE,Call the Embassy.
S07E07,JERRY,They're closed.
S07E07,GEORGE,Why?
S07E07,JERRY,Bomb threat.
S07E07,GEORGE,We're in Turkey?
S07E07,JERRY,"Midnight Express, my friend."
S07E07,GEORGE,My card won't work there; they're not on the Plus system.
S07E07,PETERMAN,You must be Jerry Seinfeld.
S07E07,JERRY,"Yes, hi, Mr. Peterman. This is, uh, George Costanza."
S07E07,PETERMAN,J. Peterman.
S07E07,GEORGE,(grabbing lapels) J. Crew.
S07E07,JERRY,"Well, is Elaine here?"
S07E07,PETERMAN,"Oh, Elaine just called, she won't be joining us. Not to worry, I'll tell the maitre'd it'll just be the three bulls."
S07E07,GEORGE,What's going on? He still wants to have dinner with us?
S07E07,JERRY,Without Elaine? What for?
S07E07,GEORGE,"What, is he crazy?"
S07E07,JERRY,"We gotta get out of here. Come on; weave your web, liar man."
S07E07,GEORGE,"I've got nothing, I-I-I-I'm blank."
S07E07,JERRY,"George, what's the matter with you?"
S07E07,GEORGE,I'm choking!
S07E07,PETERMAN,"Ah, Fong has been most accommodating. Shall we?"
S07E07,JERRY,"Actually, you know I just remembered I promised this comedy club that I'd do a set tonight, so, terribly sorry."
S07E07,PETERMAN,"I understand, no hard feelings. George and I will miss your company. Fong? It will just be two this evening. George, we dine."
S07E07,ELAINE,"(to herself) I can't believe this, is this guy standing me up?"
S07E07,PETERMAN,"...And there, tucked into the river's bend was the object of my search. The Gwon-Jaya River market, fabrics and spices traded under a starlit sky. It was there that I discovered the Pamplona beret. Sizes seven-and-a-half through eight-and-three-quarters. Price? Thirty-five dollars."
S07E07,GEORGE,Howbout sports? Do you follow sports?
S07E07,TV ANNOUNCER,It's fourth and inches and the Giants are going for it! You gotta love sports!
S07E07,GEORGE,"You know, this is very nice, but I really could take a cab. Really."
S07E07,PETERMAN,"Ha ha, nonsense, George. Besides it gives me a chance to tell you about my latest trip to Burma where I discovered a very unusual corduroy."
S07E07,PETERMAN,"Peterman here. What? Oh no. Alright, I'll be right there. (To George) It's my mother; she's at death's door. I just pray to God we can make it there in time."
S07E07,JERRY,I can't believe you blew us off; we were doing you the favor.
S07E07,ELAINE,"Well, Fred asked me out."
S07E07,JERRY,Fred?
S07E07,ELAINE,"Yeah, and then he stood me up. I don't get this guy."
S07E07,JERRY,You see what's going on here? You're attracted to him because he can't remember anything about you.
S07E07,ELAINE,I am? But that's so sick.
S07E07,JERRY,That's God's plan. He doesn't really want anyone to get together.
S07E07,ELAINE,"Anyway, so how was the dinner?"
S07E07,JERRY,"Well, when I heard you weren't coming I made up and excuse and got the hell out of there."
S07E07,ELAINE,What about Georgie?
S07E07,JERRY,"Nah, he didn't make it."
S07E07,PETERMAN,"Doctor, how is she?"
S07E07,DOCTOR,She's too weak to talk but she'll be happy to hear your voice.
S07E07,PETERMAN,"Mama, it's me. Jacopo. I'm here for you, mama."
S07E07,GEORGE,"I'm, uh, George Costanza. I was having dinner with your son."
S07E07,PETERMAN,"Shake off the dew, my friend."
S07E07,GEORGE,Yeah. What time is it?
S07E07,PETERMAN,"It's morning. Thanks for seeing me through the night. I'll make us a pot of coffee, George. Watch her, won't you?"
S07E07,GEORGE,Who?
S07E07,PETERMAN,"Momma. Just talk to her, George. The doctor seems to think it helps."
S07E07,GEORGE,"Hi. I-I really should be getting back to my fianc, you know, we, uh, we had this big fight yesterday and, uh, well she, she wants to-to know my secret code. I-I don't know, I can't tell her. The funny thing is, you know, I would really love to tell someone 'cause it's killing me. You uh, you wanna know what it is? It's Bosco. You know, the chocolate syrup? I love that stuff, I pour it in milk, it's my favorite drink. Hoo-hoo, boy, that is a relief!"
S07E07,MRS. PETERMAN,Bosco. Bosco.
S07E07,GEORGE,"Oh, shhh."
S07E07,MRS. PETERMAN,(sitting up) Bosco!
S07E07,MRS. PETERMAN,Bosco! Bosco! Bosco!
S07E07,GEORGE,Shut up! Shut up!
S07E07,PETERMAN,Momma! What are you trying to say?
S07E07,MRS. PETERMAN,Bosco.
S07E07,PETERMAN,She's gone. Bosco?
S07E07,GEORGE,You know this whole thing never would have happened if you hadn't bailed out on me at the restaurant.
S07E07,JERRY,I did not bail out on you.
S07E07,GEORGE,Well why couldn't you include me in your excuse?
S07E07,JERRY,Why didn't you come up with your own?
S07E07,GEORGE,I froze. I think I'm losing it.
S07E07,JERRY,"Ah, c'mon. Maybe you're just in a slump?"
S07E07,GEORGE,"No, no. I reached down and there was *nothing* there."
S07E07,GEORGE,Now Peterman wants me to go to the funeral.
S07E07,JERRY,"Oh, come on, just tell me your code already. What is it?"
S07E07,GEORGE,I am not giving you my code.
S07E07,KRAMER,I'll bet I can guess it.
S07E07,GEORGE,Pssh. Yeah. Right.
S07E07,KRAMER,"Oh, alright. Yeah. Uh, let's see. Um, well, we can throw out birthdays immediately. That's too obvious. And no numbers for you, you're a word man. Alright, let's go deeper. Uh, what kind of man are you? Well, you're weak, spineless, a man of temptations, but what tempts you?"
S07E07,GEORGE,Huh?
S07E07,KRAMER,"You're a portly fellow, a bit long in the waistband. So what's your pleasure? Is it the salty snacks you crave? No no no no no, yours is a sweet tooth."
S07E07,GEORGE,Get out of here.
S07E07,KRAMER,"Oh you may stray, but you'll always return to your dark master, the cocoa bean."
S07E07,GEORGE,I'm leaving.
S07E07,KRAMER,"(building up steam as George bolts for the door) No, and only the purest syrup nectar can satisfy you!"
S07E07,GEORGE,I gotta go.
S07E07,KRAMER,If you could you'd guzzle it by the gallon! Ovaltine! Hershey's!
S07E07,GEORGE,Shut up!
S07E07,KRAMER,Nestl's Quik!
S07E07,GEORGE,Shut up!
S07E07,GEORGE,What was that?
S07E07,ELAINE,What?
S07E07,GEORGE,You just checked your watch. Are you thinking of bailing on him?
S07E07,ELAINE,I got a date.
S07E07,ELAINE,"Oh, Mr. Peterman."
S07E07,PETERMAN,"Oh, Elaine. George, when momma said 'Bosco' she must have been trying to communicate something, a legacy, a dying wish perhaps."
S07E07,GEORGE,Mothers say things. My mother goes babbling on and on like a crazy person.
S07E07,ELAINE,"Mr. Peterman, you have my deepest sympathies. Unfortunately, I've gotta get going."
S07E07,PETERMAN,You do?
S07E07,GEORGE,"Uh, yes, actually we-we both do."
S07E07,ELAINE,I have a personal commitment.
S07E07,GEORGE,"Well, personal, I mean, we both uh..."
S07E07,PETERMAN,What is it?
S07E07,ELAINE,I'm speaking at a women's' rights conference.
S07E07,GEORGE,"Yes, and I'm speaking at a men's' conference."
S07E07,PETERMAN,"I don't believe that for a minute. Well, Elaine, it was good of you to stop by."
S07E07,ELAINE,My pleasure.
S07E07,PETERMAN,"Fortunately, I still have George here to help me through this."
S07E07,PETERMAN,"You know George, growing up as a boy in Costa Rica, I heard a rumor that momma had taken a lover. Perhaps Bosco was this man's name."
S07E07,KRAMER,"Hey, you wanna come down the fire station with me?"
S07E07,JERRY,Fire station?
S07E07,KRAMER,"Yeah, I made a map of my shortcuts. I'm gonna rock their world!"
S07E07,JERRY,"Nah, I gotta go down to Leapin' Larry's."
S07E07,KRAMER,"Oh, so he took you back."
S07E07,JERRY,"Yeah, we straightened it out, all is forgiven."
S07E07,KRAMER,"Well, you know the important thing is that you learned something."
S07E07,JERRY,No I didn't.
S07E07,CAPTAIN,"Well, Mr. Kramer, your list of short cuts is most impressive."
S07E07,KRAMER,"Yeah, and this is just the Upper West Side. Wait until I get to the Village, then you're gonna see a magic show."
S07E07,CAPTAIN,"Mr. Kramer, just about every week some brash young hothead like yourself saunters in here talking about faster routes and snazzier colors for the trucks, well, fact is we feel things are fine the way they are."
S07E07,JERRY,"Anyway, thanks for having me back, and sorry about the misunderstanding."
S07E07,LEAPIN' LARRY,"Water under the bridge. Come on, I never did get a chance to show you around the store."
S07E07,JERRY,Oh sure.
S07E07,JERRY,"Uh, again? (Limping towards the door) I'll be right there."
S07E07,DISPATCHER,"Attention Company 390, structure fire at Leapin' Larry's Appliance Warehouse."
S07E07,KRAMER,"Leapin' Larry's? Hey, that's uptown. You gotta take Amsterdam."
S07E07,CAPTAIN,"Stay out of this, Kramer."
S07E07,KRAMER,"Are you ok, cowboy? Where do you need to go?"
S07E07,KRAMER,"Well, you'd better take it easy."
S07E07,FRED,"Sorry about the other night but my mother called, she couldn't find her pills. I had to go into Brooklyn to help her find her pills, and they were right there in the medicine cabinet. Could you believe that?"
S07E07,ELAINE,Huh.
S07E07,FRED,The worst part is getting from the subway station to the house. There's no transportation...
S07E07,ELAINE,"(to herself) What am I doing? I'm on a date with this guy because he didn't remember me? He's demented, listen to him..."
S07E07,FRED,"...I could have taken a cab but if my mother saw me pull up in a cab, she'd start yelling at me, ""Freddy! What are taking a cab for? It's so expensive!"" She's out of her mind. Eventually, you'll meet her."
S07E07,PETERMAN,Bosco. Bosco. Bosco.
S07E07,(A woman rushes in and shouts,"There's a big fire down the street, the whole block is going up in flames! Peterman gets up and runs towards the door, he stops and looks back. George is still sitting on the couch, looking up and shaking his head."
S07E07,PETERMAN,George!
S07E07,CAPTAIN,Gonna make a left onto Broadway.
S07E07,CAPTAIN,Who is this?
S07E07,KRAMER,It's Kramer!
S07E07,CAPTAIN,Kramer?! What the hell are you doing back there?
S07E07,KRAMER,"DeSoto's down, but Cosmo's got the caboose."
S07E07,WOMAN,How did this start?
S07E07,JERRY,Beats me.
S07E07,LEAPIN' LARRY,Where the hell's the fire department? I'm gonna lose the whole store!
S07E07,CAPTAIN,"Kramer, get the hell off of there. You're not trained to operate this equipment!"
S07E07,MAN ON THE STREET,"Hey, Kramer!"
S07E07,LEAPIN' LARRY,"Try the scanner, see if you can pick up anything."
S07E07,CAPTAIN,"What are you doing, Kramer?! You're all over the road!"
S07E07,KRAMER,"Don't worry, Cap, I can handle it!"
S07E07,JERRY,Kramer?
S07E07,CAPTAIN,You're losing control! Hard right! Hard right!
S07E07,JERRY,"Ah, that's a shame."
S07E07,PETERMAN,The fire will eat up this entire block!
S07E07,PETERMAN,"Look, there's a man in there. Get out of there, you're in danger!"
S07E07,MAN,"But my sleeve, it's stuck in the machine, it ate my card!"
S07E07,PETERMAN,"George, give me your ATM card!"
S07E07,GEORGE,I don't have my ATM card.
S07E07,PETERMAN,"George, you're obviously lying, anyone can see that!"
S07E07,PETERMAN,"It's jammed! I'll slide it under the door,"
S07E07,MAN,Now give me your code!
S07E07,GEORGE,What?! Why?
S07E07,MAN,The machine won't open without the code!
S07E07,PETERMAN,"George, give him your code!"
S07E07,GEORGE,But I-I-I-
S07E07,PETERMAN,"George, there's no time! Tell him your code! Shout out your code, man!!"
S07E07,MAN,The code!! The code!!
S07E07,SUSAN,"Hi. Here's your cash, George."
S07E07,GEORGE,Hm. Thanks.
S07E07,SUSAN,And here's your card back. Anyone for Bosco?
S07E07,JERRY,Oh my god. Look at this.
S07E07,GEORGE,Hm?
S07E07,JERRY,It's the new J. Peterman catalog. Look.
S07E07,GEORGE,"The Rogue's Wallet. That's where he kept his card, his dirty little secret. Short, devious, balding. his name was Costanza. He killed my mother."
S07E08,GEORGE,Let me ask you a question. Who would win in a fight between you and me?
S07E08,JERRY,"Well, what do you mean?"
S07E08,GEORGE,"Well if you and I ever got into, like a really serious fight you know, and the punches started flying -- who do you think would win?"
S07E08,JERRY,Well I think that's pretty obvious.
S07E08,GEORGE,Yeah. Me too.
S07E08,JERRY,Hey Elaine.
S07E08,ELAINE,Hey.
S07E08,JERRY,"Who, who, who do you think would win in a fight between me and ah, gorgeous George here. (pointing up and down at George)"
S07E08,ELAINE,You mean in a real Fight Fight?
S07E08,JERRY,Mona a Baldo .
S07E08,ELAINE,George.
S07E08,GEORGE,Ah-Ha! (he turns and walks over to the refrigerator)
S07E08,JERRY,Why?
S07E08,ELAINE,George fights dirty. (she sips her coffee)
S07E08,JERRY,Really? What would you do?
S07E08,GEORGE,"Pull hair, Poke eyes, Groin stuff. Whatever I gotta do. (he opens a blue bottled beverage)"
S07E08,JERRY,Hmm.
S07E08,ELAINE,"So. Listen ... You're not doing anything tomorrow, are you? Because I have an extra ticket to the historical clothing exhibit at the Met."
S07E08,JERRY,Im sorry.
S07E08,ELAINE,George?
S07E08,GEORGE,Would I want to see what Mary Todd wore to Lincoln's funeral?
S07E08,ELAINE,There's nobody I can go with.
S07E08,ELAINE,You know what. I don't have one female friend left.
S07E08,KRAMER,"Oh, no, of course you don't. You're a Man's Woman. You hate other women, and they hate you."
S07E08,ELAINE,Thank you.
S07E08,KRAMER,"So Jerry, (smacks hands and rubs palms together) What time we going to the movies?"
S07E08,JERRY,"Ah, how about 830?"
S07E08,KRAMER,Saddle up and ride. (opens the fridge and pulls out some food -- takes a big bite)
S07E08,JERRY,You want to get something to eat first?
S07E08,KRAMER,"(mumbling with full mouth) No, Im good."
S07E08,GEORGE,"I wonder if, ah, Susan ... (picks up the phone from the coffee table, then decides not to call) No. I better just go. (claps hands) heh. All right! See ya. (grabs his rain coat from the hook by the door and rushes out)"
S07E08,KRAMER,"There's nothing more pathetic, than a grown man, whos afraid of a woman . (voice get high-pitched for the last line)"
S07E08,JERRY,"Hey, why don't cha ask Susan?"
S07E08,ELAINE,George's Susan?
S07E08,JERRY,Yeah.
S07E08,ELAINE,"Yeah. Why not Susan. I should be friends with Susan. (smacks her forehead with hand) Of course! Susan! Oh! OK, Ill see you guys. Huh. (rushes out the door.)"
S07E08,KRAMER,That's gunna be trouble.
S07E08,JERRY,Why?
S07E08,KRAMER,"Jerry, don't you see? This world here, this is George's sanctuary. If Susan comes into contact with this world, his world's collide. You know what happens then?"
S07E08,KRAMER,Ka shha shha shha Pkooo (exploding sound)
S07E08,KRAMER,Did I tell you Im getting a new telephone number?
S07E08,JERRY,How come?
S07E08,KRAMER,"Whew, chicks man. Too many chicks know my number."
S07E08,RAMON,(recognizes Jerry) Hey Jerry. How are you Mr. Backstroke?
S07E08,JERRY,"Kramer this is Ramon, from the new health club I joined."
S07E08,KRAMER,"Oh, yeah."

S07E08,JERRY,Ahh.
S07E08,RAMON,"Hey well, ah, stay out of the deep end, eh."
S07E08,JERRY,"OK, see you later."
S07E08,KRAMER,What's in the deep end?
S07E08,GEORGE,Hello?
S07E08,ELAINE,Hey George.
S07E08,GEORGE,Hey Elainie. What's going on?
S07E08,ELAINE,"(sitting up in bed) Nothing much, um. Can I talk to Susan"
S07E08,GEORGE,"Ha, Yeah right, hang on, Ill ah, Ill get her for you. he, he, he, he. Seriously, what's up?"
S07E08,ELAINE,"No, George really. Can I talk to Susan?"
S07E08,GEORGE,"Susan, why?"
S07E08,ELAINE,Because I want to ask her to lunch and to the Met tomorrow.
S07E08,GEORGE,"Oh, I don't think you want to do that."
S07E08,ELAINE,Why not?
S07E08,GEORGE,Well what would be the point of that?
S07E08,ELAINE,"George, are you going to put her on the phone?"
S07E08,GEORGE,Where did this come from all of a sudden?
S07E08,ELAINE,"George, are you going to let me talk to Susan, or Not?"
S07E08,GEORGE,I really think I should have been consulted about this.
S07E08,GEORGE,Here ... something.
S07E08,SUSAN,"Hello? (with hesitant surprise) Oh, that sounds great. I love that sort of stuff."
S07E08,KRAMER,You want to sit here?
S07E08,JERRY,"Yeah. (Kramer sits in the seat next to Jerry) Uh, uh, oh, oh, Over there. (points to the next seat over)"
S07E08,KRAMER,Why?
S07E08,JERRY,Little buffer zone.
S07E08,KRAMER,(Quietly) Buffer zone (Kramer moves to the other seat)
S07E08,JERRY,"Thank you. If we were in my apartment and we were watching a movie on the couch, would we sit right next to each other?"
S07E08,KRAMER,No. You got a point.
S07E08,JERRY,All right.
S07E08,KRAMER,I can't ...
S07E08,JERRY,What are you doing?
S07E08,KRAMER,Well these seats have no lumbar.
S07E08,JERRY,"Oh hey, there's Ramon. Pre, pretend we're talking."
S07E08,KRAMER,We are talking.
S07E08,JERRY,Pretend it's interesting.
S07E08,KRAMER,"So, ah then, I ah had to kill him and ah, well the police are still looking for me."
S07E08,JERRY,"That's shocking, but sounds ..."
S07E08,RAMON,"Hey, hi Jerry."
S07E08,JERRY,"Oh, hey Ramon."
S07E08,RAMON,"Hey, hey, I took a bunch of napkins. You want some?"
S07E08,JERRY,"Oh, no thanks. (turns back to Kramer)"
S07E08,RAMON,"Hey, ahhh, is this seat taken?"
S07E08,JERRY,No.
S07E08,JERRY,"And then the worst part is, after the movie, he leached on to us ... We wound up having coffee with him for like two hours. Then he walks us home, all the way back to the front of the building. Finally I said, look Ramon, I gotta go to bed now."
S07E08,GEORGE,"By the way, have you spoken to Elaine yet today?"
S07E08,JERRY,No why?
S07E08,GEORGE,(sighs) She called Susan last night.
S07E08,JERRY,"Oh yeah, I know."
S07E08,GEORGE,How do you know?
S07E08,JERRY,Well it was my idea.
S07E08,GEORGE,Your idea?
S07E08,JERRY,Yeah.
S07E08,GEORGE,Whad you do that for?
S07E08,JERRY,She was looking for someone to go to the show with.
S07E08,GEORGE,Well that was a really stupid thing! You know what's going to happen now?
S07E08,JERRY,World's collide. (points at George)
S07E08,GEORGE,Whe ... Well yeah!
S07E08,JERRY,Because this world is your sanctuary and if that world comes into contact with --
S07E08,GEORGE,"YES! It Blows Up! If you knew that, what did you tell Elaine for?"
S07E08,JERRY,I didnt know. Kramer told me about the worlds.
S07E08,GEORGE,"You couldn't figure out the World's Theory for yourself? It's just common sense. Anybody knows, ya gotta keep your worlds apart. (gesturing with hands going outward)"
S07E08,JERRY,"Yeah, I guess I slipped up."
S07E08,KRAMER,Hey.
S07E08,GEORGE,Hey.
S07E08,JERRY,Hey.
S07E08,GEORGE,He knows the worlds theory.
S07E08,KRAMER,What is it blowing up?
S07E08,GEORGE,Ha! (grabs his coat and exits the apartment)
S07E08,KRAMER,"Cosmo, go. No, no, na, na. (he pushes the end button and pushes the antenna down) Boy this new telephone number's driving me crazy -- wrong numbers, every five minutes."
S07E08,JERRY,What is it?
S07E08,KRAMER,Well it's 555-3455.
S07E08,JERRY,555-3455.
S07E08,KRAMER,Yeah.
S07E08,JERRY,"(picks up the phone on the coffee table) 555-3455. Well wait a second, don't you see that's 555-FILK."
S07E08,KRAMER,What's Filk?
S07E08,JERRY,"Filks nothing, but 555-FILM is Movie Phone."
S07E08,KRAMER,Oh Movie Phone.
S07E08,JERRY,"Yes, so people are just dialing it by mistake and getting you."
S07E08,KRAMER,"So, Im Filk?"
S07E08,JERRY,You're Filk.
S07E08,KRAMER,"Oh, Mama."
S07E08,ELAINE,Well what about that number Susan B. Anthony wore to the 19th Amendment party. Hnuh. Eye yye yye.
S07E08,SUSAN,Oh whoo. Quite the DColletage for a suffragette.
S07E08,ELAINE,"Ha, ha, ha, ha, well it must have been one hell of a party."
S07E08,SUSAN,Whoo.
S07E08,ELAINE,"Ha, ha, ha, ha."
S07E08,SUSAN,"Oh, I know what I wanted to tell you."
S07E08,ELAINE,What?
S07E08,SUSAN,"Ehahh, forget it."
S07E08,ELAINE,What? You can tell me. Ill put it in the vault.
S07E08,SUSAN,The vault?
S07E08,ELAINE,Mm-Hmm.
S07E08,PAUL - Locker room Attendant #1,"Oy, Mr. Seinfeld. We heard you went to the movies with Ramon."
S07E08,JERRY,"Oh, well, I didnt actually go with Ramon. I just bumped into him there. (putting on coat)"
S07E08,DUSTIN - Locker room Attendant #2,It's a good thing he has friends like you to cheer him up.
S07E08,PAUL,Tell him to call us.
S07E08,DUSTIN,"Tell him, Dustin says, Hello."
S07E08,JERRY,"All right, I gotta go."
S07E08,PAUL,To see Ramon?
S07E08,JERRY,What else did you two do?
S07E08,ELAINE,"Oh, I don't know, you know, girlie stuff."
S07E08,JERRY,"Ah, so, ah, flower shows and, shopping for pretty bows, and then back to her place, strip down to bra and panties for a tickle fight?"
S07E08,ELAINE,"That's really what you think girls do, isn't it?"
S07E08,JERRY,"Yes, I do. (very serious)"
S07E08,ELAINE,All rightee. (turns and walks to the bathroom)
S07E08,JERRY,"Hey you know George isn't to happy, ahh, about your new friendship."
S07E08,ELAINE,Yeah? Well I don't really give a Sh... (closing the bathroom door)
S07E08,KRAMER,"Hey man, what's going on?"
S07E08,JERRY,Hey.
S07E08,KRAMER,"Ooh, here we go. (pulls a cordless phone from his pocket) Yeah hello. Yeah, no, no, no, hold on."
S07E08,KRAMER,"Yeah, Cupids Rifle -- 830, Sony Lincoln Square. Yeah, no, no, no, no problem, yeah."
S07E08,JERRY,You're looking up movies for people now?
S07E08,KRAMER,I got time.

S07E08,JERRY,(shaking his head no) No Kramer I don't want to talk to him.
S07E08,KRAMER,"Just, just tell him about the picture. What's the matter with you? Stop it. (puts the phone back to his ear) Yes, are you still there? Look Im sorry about that. All right there's an 830 and a 1015showing."
S07E08,JERRY,Oh that's George. (presses the intercom button) Yeah?
S07E08,RAMON,(Hey it's Ramon)
S07E08,JERRY,What?
S07E08,RAMON,"(Hey, It's Ramon Jerry. Im coming up)"
S07E08,JERRY,"(to Ramon) Oh. Okay. (to Elaine) Wh, what is he doing here?"
S07E08,ELAINE,Who? Who is Ramon?
S07E08,JERRY,He's the pool guy.
S07E08,ELAINE,What pool guy?
S07E08,JERRY,Do me a favor. Just stick around while he's here.
S07E08,ELAINE,"Yeah, no problem."
S07E08,ELAINE,"You know, you have the slowest elevator in the entire city? That's hard to get used to when you're in so many other fast ones."
S07E08,JERRY,"Well, the apartment elevators are always slower than the offices, because you don't have to be home on time."
S07E08,RAMON,"Hee hey, hey Jerry (claps hands and points both index fingers at him) How are you, crazy guy?"
S07E08,JERRY,"Hey. So, ah, Ramon this is my friend Elaine."
S07E08,ELAINE,Yeah and I was just leaving. Bye-bye Jerry. (smiling as she closes the door. Jerry looks at her like he can not believe she left him on his own)
S07E08,JERRY,"So, ah, what are you doing around here Ramon?"
S07E08,RAMON,"Well, I was in the neighborhood. I figured Id check you out."
S07E08,JERRY,"Ah, actually, I ka, kinda had some things to do."
S07E08,RAMON,"Oh, oh yeah. Wha? Where you going?"
S07E08,JERRY,"Ah, just, you know, I don't know. Stuff, I gotta do. (grabs coat and throws it over his shoulder)"
S07E08,RAMON,Hey that's cool. Im up for some stuff
S07E08,JERRY,All right.
S07E08,RAMON,"So get this. I get down there, and right away, I see the drain is clogged. I mean it's obvious. Can you believe it?"
S07E08,JERRY,"All right Ramon, Im going to get going."
S07E08,JERRY,I think we should separate here actually.
S07E08,RAMON,What are you trying to say Jerry?
S07E08,JERRY,"Look Ramon, you're, you're a nice guy. But I, I actually only have three friends. I really can't handle any more."
S07E08,RAMON,"Oh I see. It's cause I clean pools, right?"
S07E08,JERRY,That has nothing to do with it.
S07E08,RAMON,"You su -- (no audio) (through the moving subway window, Ramon is swearing and pointing at Jerry)"
S07E08,SUSAN,"Yeah, we got along real well."
S07E08,GEORGE,"You know, uh, she has no female friends! You know that, don't cha? Something strange about a woman whos friends are all men."
S07E08,SUSAN,"Yeah, I know. We talked all about that."
S07E08,GEORGE,You talked all about that?
S07E08,SUSAN,Oh yeah. Elaine opened up her vault.
S07E08,GEORGE,Did you just say vault?
S07E08,SUSAN,"Yeah, why? Did I use it wrong?"
S07E08,GEORGE,You got that from Elaine.
S07E08,SUSAN,Yeah. So what?
S07E08,GEORGE,Well it's a little strange. You going to start to talk like Elaine from now on?
S07E08,SUSAN,I don't know. Anyway I thought we'd all go to a movie on Friday.
S07E08,GEORGE,Wed all go to movie on Friday?
S07E08,SUSAN,Yeah.
S07E08,GEORGE,This is not good. World's are colliding! George is getting upset!
S07E08,GEORGE,"Ah you have no idea of the magnitude of this thing. If she is allowed to infiltrate this world, then George Costanza as you know him, Ceases to Exist! You see, right now, I have Relationship George, but there is also Independent George. That's the George you know, the George you grew up with -- Movie George, Coffee shop George, Liar George, Bawdy George."
S07E08,JERRY,"I, I love that George."
S07E08,GEORGE,"Me Too! And he's Dying Jerry! If Relationship George walks through this door, he will Kill Independent George! A George, divided against itself, Cannot Stand!"
S07E08,GEORGE,"You're Killing Independent George! You know that, don't you?"
S07E08,ELAINE,George I don't even want to get --
S07E08,GEORGE,"You know what word Susan used last night? Hnuh. Vault! hu,"
S07E08,ELAINE,So?
S07E08,GEORGE,She got that from you!
S07E08,ELAINE,"Well, I didnt tell here to say it."
S07E08,GEORGE,Is she the only girl in the whole world? Why can't you get find your own girl?
S07E08,ELAINE,I Like Her!
S07E08,GEORGE,You see (to Jerry). You see. You see what Im talking about. It's all just slipping away. And you're letting it happen. (exits -- slamming the door)
S07E08,JERRY,So you want to catch a movie later?
S07E08,ELAINE,"Ahh, yeah, sure."
S07E08,JERRY,I don't have a paper though.
S07E08,ELAINE,Hmm. (picks up the phone and dials)
S07E08,KRAMER,"Hewwo and welcome to Movie phone. Brought to you by the New York Times and Hot 97. Coming to theaters this Friday ... Kevin Bacon, Susan Sarandon -- You've got to get me over that mountain! Now (bang, bang) AHHHHHHHHHH There is no place higher than ... Mountain High . Rated R.

S07E08,ELAINE,"Kramer, is that you?"
S07E08,KRAMER,Elaine?
S07E08,ELAINE,"Uh, what time does Chow Fun start?"
S07E08,KRAMER,I don't know.
S07E08,RAMON,"Well, well. Look whos here."
S07E08,JERRY,"Ramon, what are you doing here? You could get in trouble."
S07E08,RAMON,"No, I don't think so Jerry. You see they gave me my job back."
S07E08,JERRY,What?
S07E08,RAMON,Im a pool boy ... again.
S07E08,JERRY,"Look Ramon, about the other day. Im sorry if I offended you. I get a little crabby on the subway."
S07E08,RAMON,Do you?
S07E08,JERRY,What happened to all the towels?
S07E08,RAMON,"Oh, ah, I guess they must have disappeared. (walks away)"
S07E08,NEWMAN,"Hey Jerry. Look at all the towels they gave me! I really hit the jackpot! (holding a large stack of towels, Newman pats his face with the top one) Ha, ha, ha."
S07E08,JERRY,It's been a terrible situation down there the past couple of days. He's really been making things uncomfortable for me. There's always a big pile of dirty towels in front of my locker ...
S07E08,ELAINE,Uh-huh.
S07E08,JERRY,"And then when I come out of the pool, my towel's always gone."
S07E08,ELAINE,"Uhh, so frustrating!"
S07E08,JERRY,Tell me about it.
S07E08,ELAINE,"Uhh, so you want to join me and Susan for lunch at the coffee shop?"
S07E08,JERRY,You're meeting Susan for lunch at the coffee shop?
S07E08,ELAINE,Yeah.
S07E08,JERRY,Im meeting George for lunch at the coffee shop.
S07E08,ELAINE,"Oh, huh. Well, this should be very interesting."
S07E08,SUSAN,Hey! Elaine! Jerry. Over here!
S07E08,KRAMER,There they are.
S07E08,SUSAN,"Yeah, look who I ran into."
S07E08,KRAMER,Hey.
S07E08,ELAINE,Yeah. (sits down next to Susan)
S07E08,KRAMER,Yeah.
S07E08,ELAINE,Ahh.
S07E08,KRAMER,Come on Jerry. Aren't you going to join us?
S07E08,JERRY,"Ah, you know. Im supposed to meet, eh, someone -- Ill, Ill wait for them outside. (walks towards the door)"
S07E08,KRAMER,"Yeah, wait here. Come on, sit down. What's the matter with you?"
S07E08,JERRY,This is gonna to be ugly. (quietly)
S07E08,SUSAN,What's that Jerry?
S07E08,JERRY,"(coughing) I said, boy am I ugly."
S07E08,SUSAN,"Oh, hey, hey, Georgie boy, over here."
S07E08,GEORGE,"One, two ... three, four."
S07E08,GEORGE,Ha Ho! (he turns and walks out the door)
S07E08,SUSAN,Hey George!
S07E08,JERRY,We'll pull up another chair.
S07E08,JERRY,I see you there Ramon.
S07E08,JERRY,"Hey, lll just keep swimming. Hey, hey. Im not done. I know what you're up to Ramon. Because Im a member here, this is my place to swim."
S07E08,JERRY,"Hey, you better cut it out Ramon. Just stop it."
S07E08,RAMON,Oh.
S07E08,NEWMAN,"Olly, olly, oxen, free!"
S07E08,JERRY,(NO!)
S07E08,JERRY,"I think he's gonna need, mouth-to-mouth resuscitation."
S07E08,NEWMAN,Mouth-to-mouth?
S07E08,JERRY,Yeah.
S07E08,NEWMAN,Huh.
S07E08,JERRY,Well? Go ahead.
S07E08,NEWMAN,You go.
S07E08,JERRY,You knocked him out.
S07E08,NEWMAN,"Yeah, but you pulled him in."
S07E08,JERRY,Come on Newman. Do it.
S07E08,NEWMAN,Nah.
S07E08,JERRY,He might die.
S07E08,NEWMAN,Yeah. Maybe.
S07E08,ELAINE,"(on the phone to) Look Jerry, we'll meet you at the theater. (hangs up the phone) OK, next showings at 900, we can't wait any longer."
S07E08,SUSAN,"Elaine, where could he be? It's not like George to just disappear."
S07E08,ELAINE,"Look, let's just leave him a note, okay?"
S07E08,SUSAN,"Oh, I don't know."
S07E08,ELAINE,"Oh, come on, come on, come on. (picks up pad of paper and writes) George, Elaine and I went to see Chunnel ... with Jerry. Love?"
S07E08,SUSAN,Yeah.
S07E08,ELAINE,Love ... Susan.
S07E08,JERRY,"So eventually these people came and, somebody, gave him mouth-to-mouth."
S07E08,ELAINE,He could have died
S07E08,JERRY,"Yeah, it was a gamble."
S07E08,SUSAN,Why didnt you give him mouth-to-mouth?
S07E08,JERRY,Ah. (makes face)
S07E08,ELAINE,How can you possibly show your face there again?
S07E08,JERRY,"Oh I can't. They revoked my membership. Newman too. You know, we can't go anywhere near there."
S07E08,ELAINE,"Hi, ah, three for Chunnel -- two adults ... one child. (looking towards Jerry)"
S07E08,GEORGE,"What the hell is this? George, Elaine and I went to see Chunnel ... with Jerry. With Jerry, huh? With Jerry! Great. Great! (dials phone) Probably went to the 84th St. That's where I always go with Jerry."
S07E08,KRAMER,"Hewwo and welcome to Movie phone. If you know the name of the movie you'd like to see, press one."
S07E08,GEORGE,Come on. Come on.

S07E08,GEORGE,Chunnel ?
S07E08,KRAMER,"To find the theater nearest you, please enter your five digit zip-code, now."
S07E08,KRAMER,Why don't you just tell me where you want to see the movie?
S07E08,GEORGE,"Lowes Paragon, 84th and Broadway."
S07E08,KRAMER,"(picks up paper) Chunnel , is playing at the Paragon 84th Street cinema in the main theater at 930 PM."
S07E08,GEORGE,"Yeah, now I gotcha! (hangs up the phone and rushes out the door)"
S07E08,KRAMER,It's also playing in theater number two at 900.
S07E08,GEORGE,Jerry ... Where are you? I know you like to sit back here. Elaine! Susan!
S07E08,MOVIE PATRON,SHH!
S07E08,(from the movie we hear this dialogue,"The English Channel Tunnel, Chunnel, runs 32.3 miles, with two openings. One here, in England and another one here, in France. That's all we got. Thank you for your time gentlemen. Can I ask you a question Mr. McKittrick. -- it's a bit hard to hear the movie dialogue, as we are supposed to be focused on George, but I was able to make out most of it)"
S07E08,JERRY,I can't figure out what's going on here. I can't follow the plot. Why did they kill that guy? I thought he was with them?
S07E08,SUSAN,"No, no. That's not the guy. That's a different guy."
S07E08,JERRY,What is he doing in the Chunnel?
S07E08,SUSAN,"Would you two, Please?"
S07E08,"(again, from the movie we hear this dialogue","Let me tell you something about the Chunnel, Mr. Thane. That our only freeway is adept. (inaudible) Elaine Brookstone will get the money bag (inaudible) Not as long as I have these long stickers. Find him and Kill him! I don't care if we have to turn this Chunnel upside down! Find Him! Everybody out of the Chunnel! Everybody out! The Chunnels gonna blow! AHHHHHH (Explosion)"
S07E08,GEORGE,Susan! Jerry! Where are you? I know you're there! Answer me!
S07E08,MOVIE PATRON,"(Hey, sit down!)"
S07E08,GEORGE,"Hey. Hey. Answer me! Come on, show yourselves!"
S07E08,MOVIE PATRON,"(Hey, we're trying to watch a movie here!)"
S07E08,GEORGE,"Drink your soda! Come on! I know you're there, laughing at me. Laughing and lying and laughing! I had to go to Reggies, Jerry! Reggies!"
S07E08,MOVIE PATRON,(Move it off of there!)
S07E08,GEORGE,Where are you!
S07E08,2nd MOVIE PATRON,(Hey are you sure you got the right theater?)
S07E08,GEORGE,"Yeah, yeah, yeah. Chunnel . Susan!"
S07E08,2nd MOVIE PATRON,(It's playing in two theaters.)
S07E08,GEORGE,Two theaters?
S07E08,2nd MOVIE PATRON,"(Yeah, there's a 900 too.)"
S07E08,GEORGE,Oh. Sorry.
S07E08,"(once again, from the movie we hear this dialogue","There's something else, your ex-wife. Alexandra? She's in France, Im telling ya. No, she's in the Chunnel. The Chunnel? No! Mr. President, Im sorry to disturb you. What is it? There's something about the Chunnel. Oh? (inaudible) And that means your daughter is in the Chunnel. Somewhere between France and ... (inaudible)"
S07E08,ELAINE,"I thought that was pretty good, huh?"
S07E08,JERRY,Whad you think Susan?
S07E08,SUSAN,"Oh, I don't know. I couldn't hear anything. You, you talked the whole movie."
S07E08,ELAINE,"Oh, well come on. You want to go grab a bite to eat?"
S07E08,JERRY,Yeah.
S07E08,SUSAN,"Ah, no. I don't think so."
S07E08,ELAINE,Why not?
S07E08,SUSAN,"Well you know, all you guys ever do is sit around the coffee shop talking, sit around Jerry's apartment talking. Frankly, I don't know how you can stand it. Ill see you."
S07E08,GEORGE,"I know they're in there, the three of them, laughing at me. Together, laughing and lying."
S07E08,USHER,Let's go pal.
S07E08,GEORGE,"They're -- They're killing independent George! And they're, they're all in on it! World's are colliding!"
S07E08,[Outside Kramers apartment door,5B A partial view of a man's face and his hand knocks 3 times on the door.]

S07E09,KRAMER,"Yeah, yeah, so...git-git...(gestures to Elaine to sign the form.)"
S07E09,ELAINE (signing),"Well, I admire you for joining the fight against AIDS."
S07E09,KRAMER,"Well, if I didn't do something I wouldn't be able to live with myself."
S07E09,JERRY (signing),It's hard enough living next door.
S07E09,KRAMER,"I tell ya, there's some people, they just wear a ribbon and they think they're doin' something? Not me. I talk the talk, and I walk the walk, baby. (gets up) I'll be right back."

S07E09,JERRY,Yeah.
S07E09,ELAINE,Still a 31 waist?
S07E09,JERRY,"Yep. Since college. (Looks at Kramer's AIDS walk list.) Hey, Lena Small's on this list."
S07E09,ELAINE,Lena Small?
S07E09,JERRY,"Yeah, that girl I was gonna call for a date, she was unlisted...and now here's her number."
S07E09,ELAINE,"Oh, you're not gonna cop a girl's phone number off an AIDS charity list!"
S07E09,JERRY (copying down the number),"Elaine, you should admire me...I'm aspiring to date a giving person."
S07E09,ELAINE,You're a taking person.
S07E09,JERRY,"That's why I should date a giving person. If I date a taking person, everyone's taking, taking, taking, no one's giving - it's bedlam."
S07E09,ELAINE (warns),She's gonna ask how you got her number.
S07E09,JERRY,"Oh, I'll tell her I met some guy who knew her and he gave it to me."
S07E09,ELAINE,What's he look like?
S07E09,JERRY,"I really didn't pay much attention, I'd just come from buying a speedboat."
S07E09,ELAINE,You're buying a speedboat?
S07E09,JERRY,"See, we're already off the subject of how I got her number. (Elaine laughs.) All I gotta do is get past the first phone call and I'm home free."
S07E09,ELAINE,I don't know about that.
S07E09,JERRY,"So if Billy had gotten your number off the AIDS walk list, you wouldn't have gone out with him?"
S07E09,ELAINE,Well...
S07E09,JERRY,Yeah. So you really like this guy.
S07E09,ELAINE,Very much.
S07E09,JERRY,How's the...sexual chemistry?
S07E09,ELAINE,Haven't been in the lab yet. But I am birth control shopping today. (Kramer overhears as he returns to the booth.)
S07E09,KRAMER,Are you still on the pill?
S07E09,ELAINE,"Uh, Kramer..."
S07E09,KRAMER,"I'll tell ya, I think birth control should be discussed in an open forum."
S07E09,ELAINE,"The sponge, o.k.? The Today sponge."
S07E09,KRAMER,But wasn't that taken off the market?
S07E09,ELAINE,"Off the market? The sponge? No, no...no way. Everybody loves the sponge."
S07E09,KRAMER,"I read it in Wall Street Week ...Louis, uh, Rukeyser."
S07E09,JERRY,"Hello, Lena? Hi, it's Jerry Seinfeld. How did I get your number? I met a guy that knows you, he gave it to me...I don't remember his name. Think it began with a W, maybe a Q. I wasn't paying that much attention, I'd just come from shopping for a speedboat..."
S07E09,SUSAN,"You know, I really like those new jeans Jerry was wearing. He's really thin."
S07E09,GEORGE,Not as thin as you think.
S07E09,SUSAN,Why? He's a 31. I saw the tag on the back.
S07E09,GEORGE,"The tag, huh?"
S07E09,SUSAN,Mmm-hmm.
S07E09,GEORGE,"Let me tell you something about that tag. It's no 31, and uh...let's just leave it at that."
S07E09,SUSAN,What are you talking about?
S07E09,GEORGE,He scratches off a 32 and he puts in 31.
S07E09,SUSAN,"Oh, how could he be so vain?"
S07E09,GEORGE,"Well, this is the Jerry Seinfeld that only I know. I can't believe I just told you that."
S07E09,SUSAN (laughing),Why not?
S07E09,GEORGE,"Well, Jerry doesn't want anyone to know."
S07E09,SUSAN,"Well, it's alright, I'm your fiance. Everyone assumes you'll tell me everything."
S07E09,GEORGE,Where did you get that from?
S07E09,SUSAN,"Well, we're a couple. It's understood."
S07E09,GEORGE,I never heard of that.
S07E09,SUSAN,"Well, you've never been a couple."
S07E09,GEORGE,I've coupled! I've coupled!
S07E09,SUSAN,Keeping secrets! This is just like your secret bank code.
S07E09,GEORGE,"This is totally different! That was my secret, this is Jerry's secret! There's...there's attorney-client priveleges here! If I play it by your rule, no one'll ever confide in me again, I'll be cut out of the loop!"
S07E09,GEORGE,Hey.
S07E09,JERRY,Hey. What's the matter?
S07E09,GEORGE,I had a fight with Susan.
S07E09,JERRY,What about?
S07E09,GEORGE,"Oh...(is about to tell Jerry, but reconsiders) ...clothing, something, I dunno. So, uh, what are you doing today?"
S07E09,JERRY,"I got a date with that girl, Lena."
S07E09,GEORGE,"Lena, how'd you meet her?"
S07E09,JERRY,"I actually met her a few weeks ago, but... (Jerry stops, and mentally visualizes George telling Susan about how Jerry got Lena's number from the AIDS list...then Susan passing the information along to Monica on the phone at work.)"
S07E09,GEORGE,"You met her a few weeks ago, but...?"
S07E09,JERRY (slowly),I didn't call her till today.
S07E09,GEORGE,"So, uh...wanna double?"
S07E09,JERRY,What?
S07E09,GEORGE,"Well, I just had a fight - I need a group dynamic."
S07E09,JERRY,I dunno. (Elaine enters.) Hey.
S07E09,ELAINE,"Well, Kramer was right. My friend Kim told me the sponge is off the market."
S07E09,JERRY,So what are you gonna do?
S07E09,ELAINE,"I'll tell you what I'm gonna do - I'm gonna do a hard-target search. Of every drug store, general store, health store and grocery store in a 25-block radius."
S07E09,GEORGE,Just for these sponges?
S07E09,ELAINE,"Hey man, women are really loyal to their birth control methods. What does Susan use?"
S07E09,GEORGE,I dunno.
S07E09,ELAINE,You don't know?
S07E09,GEORGE,"I, uh...figure it's something. (Kramer enters.)"
S07E09,JERRY,What are you all out of breath from?
S07E09,KRAMER (panting),The elevator just broke. I had to walk up five flights.
S07E09,JERRY,"And you got the AIDS walk tomorrow. You're never gonna make it, you're in horrible shape."
S07E09,KRAMER,"Hey, I'm in tip-top shape. Better than you!"
S07E09,JERRY,"I got a 31 waist, mister!"
S07E09,KRAMER,"Yeah, well I'm walking for charity, what are you doing?"
S07E09,JERRY (proudly),What am I doing? I'm...dating a woman who happens to be sponsoring one of these walkers.
S07E09,PHARMACIST,Can I help you?
S07E09,ELAINE (with little hope),"Yeah, do you have any Today sponges? I know they're off the market, but..."
S07E09,PHARMACIST,"Actually, we have a case left."
S07E09,ELAINE (excited),"A case! A case of sponges? I mean, uh...a case. Huh. Uh...how many come in a case?"
S07E09,PHARMACIST,Sixty.
S07E09,ELAINE,"Sixty?! Uh...well, I'll take three."
S07E09,PHARMACIST,Three.
S07E09,ELAINE,Make it ten.
S07E09,PHARMACIST,Ten?
S07E09,ELAINE,Twenty sponges should be plenty.
S07E09,PHARMACIST,Did you say twenty?
S07E09,ELAINE,"Yeah, twenty-five sponges is just fine."
S07E09,PHARMACIST,"Right. So, you're set with twenty-five."
S07E09,ELAINE,Yeah. Just give me the whole case and I'll be on my way.
S07E09,JERRY,"Hey, I have found the best-smelling detergent. Lena, smell my shirt."
S07E09,LENA (smells Jerry's arm),Mmm! Very nice.
S07E09,JERRY,It's All-Tempa-Cheer.
S07E09,LENA,I use Planet. It's bio-degradable and doesn't pollute the oceans.
S07E09,GEORGE,"Yeah, the oceans really are getting very sudsy."
S07E09,LENA (to waiter),"Can you wrap up all the left-overs on the table, please? I always take the left-overs. I work in a soup kitchen every morning at 6 a.m."
S07E09,JERRY,They serve soup at 6 a.m.?
S07E09,LENA,Yeah. That's all they have.
S07E09,JERRY,"Do the bums ever complain? ""Soup again?"""
S07E09,GEORGE,I'd get tired of it.
S07E09,JERRY,How could you not?
S07E09,LENA,Guess who volunteered last week?
S07E09,GEORGE,Mick Jagger.
S07E09,LENA,No. Maya Angelou.
S07E09,SUSAN,"Oh, the poet!"
S07E09,JERRY (to Lena),"So, let me ask you something - these people eat soup three times a day?"
S07E09,LENA,I don't know.
S07E09,SUSAN (to Lena),"So, did you get to talk to her?"
S07E09,LENA,Talk to who?
S07E09,JERRY,Is it a lot of cream soups?
S07E09,SUSAN,"Maya Angelou, the poet."
S07E09,LENA,"No, I didn't get the chance."
S07E09,GEORGE,"Oh, well, I'm sure you can reach her...she's a poet. What does a poet need an unlisted number for?"
S07E09,SUSAN,I'm going to the ladies room.
S07E09,LENA,I'll go with you. (They leave.)
S07E09,GEORGE,What are you looking at me like that for?
S07E09,JERRY,Why'd you have to mention 'unlisted number'?
S07E09,GEORGE,What are you talking about?
S07E09,JERRY,"Alright, I gotta tell you something, but you cannot tell Susan."
S07E09,SUSAN,"Jerry got her phone number off of an AIDS walk list? Oh, that's awful!"
S07E09,GEORGE,"I know, but don't say anything to anyone. He told me not to tell you."
S07E09,SUSAN,But you told me anyway?
S07E09,GEORGE,"Well, you know, I was thinking about what you said before, and...you're right, I've never really been a couple, so...if that's the rule, then I'm gonna go by the rule."
S07E09,SUSAN,"Thank you, honey."
S07E09,GEORGE,"So, you wanna go home and...make up, officially?"
S07E09,SUSAN,Can we stop by a drug store first?
S07E09,GEORGE,What for?
S07E09,SUSAN,I'm out of birth control stuff.
S07E09,GEORGE,"Oh, o.k., yeah. Where am I gonna park here...? (Pulls over.)"
S07E09,SUSAN,"Oh, don't park. I'll just sit in the car, you can run in."
S07E09,GEORGE,Me run in? Why don't you run in?
S07E09,SUSAN,"You don't know what I use for birth control, do you?"
S07E09,GEORGE,Of course I do.
S07E09,SUSAN,You do? What?
S07E09,GEORGE,"You know. You use the, uh...(mutters something unintelligible under his breath.)"
S07E09,SUSAN,The what?
S07E09,GEORGE,"You know, the uh...(mutters it again.)"
S07E09,SUSAN,"Just get me some sponges, please."
S07E09,GEORGE,"Wait, wait a minute...they don't have them anymore. I just found out, they just took them off the market."
S07E09,SUSAN,Off the market? The sponge?
S07E09,GEORGE,"Yeah, so you gotta use something else."
S07E09,SUSAN,I can't! I love the sponge! I need the sponge!
S07E09,GEORGE,O.k....(thinks) I think I know where we can get one.
S07E09,JERRY,"Kramer, what the hell is going on in there?"
S07E09,KRAMER,It's a poker game...(yells to the crowd) And I'm kickin' some serious butt!
S07E09,JERRY,Are you out of your mind? You got the AIDS walk tomorrow!
S07E09,VOICE FROM POKER GAME,"Hey, Kramer - are you in?"
S07E09,KRAMER,"Oh, you gotta be kiddin'! You see those two ladies I got showin'? Do they look scared?!"
S07E09,JERRY,You're never gonna make it!
S07E09,BILLY,"You, uh...you wanna go in the bedroom?"
S07E09,ELAINE,O.k. Hold on just a second. (Gets up and heads to the bathroom. George knocks at the door.)
S07E09,GEORGE,"Elaine? It's me, George. (Elaine opens the door.) Hey, sorry to bother you so late. (To Billy) Hey! How ya doin.' (To Elaine) Uh, did you get any of those sponges?"
S07E09,ELAINE,Yeah. Cleaned out the whole west side. Why?
S07E09,GEORGE,Well...Susan.
S07E09,ELAINE,"Ah, Susan uses the sponge."
S07E09,GEORGE,Susan loves the sponge.
S07E09,ELAINE,"Yeah, I'm sorry, George. I can't help you out."
S07E09,GEORGE,What?
S07E09,ELAINE,"I can't do it. No way, there's no how. (Tries to push George out the door. George resists.)"
S07E09,GEORGE,"Elaine...let me just explain something to you. See, this is not just a weekend routine...I'm on the verge of make-up sex here. You know about make-up sex?"
S07E09,ELAINE,"Oh yeah, I know all about make-up sex, and I'm really sorry. (Shoves George into the hallway and closes the door. George blocks the door with his foot.)"
S07E09,GEORGE,"Elaine, can I just explain something to you very privately here? Susan and I have been together many, many times now, and just between you and me, there's really no big surprises here, so...make-up sex is all that I have left."
S07E09,ELAINE,"I'm sure you'll have another fight, George. (Stamps on George's foot and closes the door.) (To Billy) Hold that thought!"
S07E09,SUSAN,"So, listen to this. But don't tell anyone - Jerry Seinfeld? He got a woman's number off an AIDS walk list."
S07E09,MONICA,He got her number off an AIDS walk list?
S07E09,LENA,He what?
S07E09,JERRY,How'd you find out?
S07E09,LENA,A friend of a friend of a friend of Susan's.
S07E09,JERRY,George!
S07E09,LENA,Pardon?
S07E09,JERRY,"Nothing. Listen, I'm sorry, I just -"
S07E09,LENA,It's o.k.! There's nothing to be sorry about. I don't mind.
S07E09,JERRY,You don't mind that I got your number off the AIDS walk list?
S07E09,LENA,"No, not at all. No problem. (Jerry looks at Lena suspiciously. Lena leaves with all of Kramer's poker buddies, who are filing out of Kramer's apartment.)"
S07E09,KRAMER,"Ah, you're lucky you're walkin' out of here with a pair of pants on!"
S07E09,JERRY,You went all night?
S07E09,KRAMER (shows Jerry his winnings),"Jerry, ah? Breakfast on me, huh?"
S07E09,JERRY,"Kramer, are you out of your mind? You got the AIDS walk in like, three hours! You're never gonna make it!"
S07E09,KRAMER,AIDS walk! That's a cake walk. (George enters.) Hey!
S07E09,JERRY,"So, George, guess what? Lena found out how I got her number."
S07E09,GEORGE,Really? How'd she do that?
S07E09,JERRY,A friend of a friend of Susan's.
S07E09,GEORGE,My Susan?
S07E09,JERRY,Why'd you tell her?!
S07E09,GEORGE,"Because, Jerry, it's a couple rule! We have to tell each other everything!"
S07E09,JERRY,"Well you know what this means, don't you?"
S07E09,GEORGE,What?
S07E09,(IMG SRC=http,//tinyurl.com/2b9c width=200 )
S07E09,JERRY,"You're cut off, you're out of the loop!"
S07E09,GEORGE,"You're cutting me off? No, no, no Jerry, don't cut me off!"
S07E09,JERRY,You leave me no choice! You're the media now as far as I'm concerned!
S07E09,GEORGE,"C'mon Jerry, please! It won't happen again."
S07E09,JERRY,"If you were in the mafia, would you tell her every time you killed someone?"
S07E09,GEORGE,"Hey, a ""hit"" is a totally different story."
S07E09,JERRY,"I don't know, George."
S07E09,GEORGE,"So, Lena was upset, huh?"
S07E09,JERRY,You know what? That was the amazing thing.
S07E09,GEORGE,"What, it didn't bother her?"
S07E09,JERRY,"No, she said it was fine. There's something very strange about this girl."
S07E09,GEORGE,What?
S07E09,JERRY,She's too good.
S07E09,GEORGE,Too good...
S07E09,JERRY,"I mean, she's giving and caring and genuinely concerned about the welfare of others - I can't be with someone like that!"
S07E09,GEORGE,I see what you mean.
S07E09,JERRY,"I mean, I admire the hell out of her. You can't have sex with someone you admire."
S07E09,GEORGE,Where's the depravity?
S07E09,JERRY,"No depravity! I mean, I look at her, I can't imagine she even has sex."
S07E09,JERRY (using Elaine as an example),On the other hand...
S07E09,ELAINE,What?
S07E09,GEORGE (to Elaine),Thanks again for last night!
S07E09,ELAINE,"Hey, I didn't even use one."
S07E09,JERRY,I thought you said it was imminent.
S07E09,ELAINE,"Yeah, it was, but then I just couldn't decide if he was really sponge-worthy."
S07E09,JERRY,Sponge-worthy?
S07E09,ELAINE,"Yeah, Jerry, I have to conserve these sponges."
S07E09,JERRY,"But you like this guy, isn't that what the sponges are for?"
S07E09,ELAINE,"Yes, yes - before they went off the market. I mean, now I've got to re-evaluate my whole screening process. I can't afford to waste any of 'em."
S07E09,GEORGE,"You know, you're nuts with these sponges. George is gettin' frustrated!"
S07E09,KRAMER (to organizer at desk),"Uh, Cosmo Kramer?"
S07E09,ORGANIZER,"Uh...o.k., you're checked in. Here's your AIDS ribbon."
S07E09,KRAMER,"Uh, no thanks."
S07E09,ORGANIZER,You don't want to wear an AIDS ribbon?
S07E09,KRAMER,No.
S07E09,ORGANIZER,But you have to wear an AIDS ribbon.
S07E09,KRAMER,I have to?
S07E09,ORGANIZER,Yes.
S07E09,KRAMER,"See, that's why I don't want to."
S07E09,ORGANIZER,But everyone wears the ribbon. You must wear the ribbon!
S07E09,KRAMER,You know what you are? You're a ribbon bully. (Walks away.)
S07E09,ORGANIZER,Hey you! Come back here! Come back here and put this on!
S07E09,GEORGE,"Elaine and her sponges...she's got like, a war chest full of them."
S07E09,SUSAN,"Well, I don't see why you just can't use condoms."
S07E09,GEORGE,"Oh, no, no...condoms are for single men. The day that we got engaged, I said goodbye to the condom forever."
S07E09,SUSAN,Just once...for the make-up sex.
S07E09,GEORGE,"Make-up sex? You have to have that right after the fight, we're way past that."
S07E09,SUSAN,"Come on, just once?"
S07E09,GEORGE,"No, no...I hate the condom."
S07E09,SUSAN,Why?
S07E09,GEORGE,I can never get the package open in time.
S07E09,SUSAN,"Well, you just tear it open."
S07E09,GEORGE,"It's not that easy. It's like ""Beat The Clock,"" there's a lot of pressure there."
S07E09,WALKER #1,"Hey, where's your ribbon?"
S07E09,KRAMER,"Oh, I don't wear the ribbon."
S07E09,WALKER #2,"Oh, you don't wear the ribbon? Aren't you against AIDS?"
S07E09,KRAMER,"Yeah, I'm against AIDS. I mean, I'm walking, aren't I? I just don't wear the ribbon."
S07E09,WALKER #3,Who do you think you are?
S07E09,WALKER #1,Put the ribbon on!
S07E09,WALKER #2,"Hey, Cedric! Bob! This guy won't wear a ribbon! (Cedric and Bob turn around and glare at Kramer.)"
S07E09,BOB,Who? Who does not want to wear the ribbon? (Kramer is frightened.)
S07E09,ELAINE,"So, you think you're sponge-worthy?"
S07E09,BILLY,"Yes, I think I'm sponge-worthy. I think I'm very sponge-worthy."
S07E09,ELAINE,Run down your case for me again...?
S07E09,BILLY,"Well, we've gone out several times, we obviously have a good rapport. I own a very profitable electronics distributing firm. I eat well. I exercise. Blood tests - immaculate. And if I can speak frankly, I'm actually quite good at it."
S07E09,ELAINE,You going to do something about your sideburns?
S07E09,BILLY,"Yeah, I told you...I'm going to trim my sideburns."
S07E09,ELAINE,And the bathroom in your apartment?
S07E09,BILLY,Cleaned it this morning.
S07E09,ELAINE,"The sink, the tub, everything got cleaned?"
S07E09,BILLY,"Everything, yeah. It's spotless."
S07E09,ELAINE,"Alright, let's go. (They head for the bedroom.)"
S07E09,JERRY,Hi.
S07E09,LENA,"Hi! Hey, look at this - I just got a citation in the mail for my work with shut-ins."
S07E09,JERRY,"Oh, the shut-ins, that's nice. You know, they're a very eccentric group. Because they're shut in. Of course, they're not locked in, they're free to go at anytime."
S07E09,LENA,"Oh, by the way, I checked at the soup kitchen - they do have cream soups."
S07E09,JERRY,"Hey, that's dynamite. You know, Lena, I wanted to talk to you about something...you know, because you're such a good person -"
S07E09,LENA,"Oh, hang onto that thought - I'm rinsing a sweater, I left the water running. (Goes into the bathroom.) Hey, Jerry, can you get me a towel out of my bedroom closet?"
S07E09,JERRY,"Oh, o.k. (Goes to the closet for the towel and finds dozens of boxes of Today sponges.)"
S07E09,JERRY'S brain,Oh my god! Look what's goin' on here! She is depraved! (Grabs a towel and brings it to Lena.) There you are.
S07E09,LENA,"Thanks. So, you were saying...?"
S07E09,JERRY,What? Nothing.
S07E09,LENA,"No, you said I was a good person..."
S07E09,JERRY,Oh...
S07E09,LENA,You seem like you want to tell me something.
S07E09,JERRY,Tell you something...I do.
S07E09,LENA,"What is it, Jerry? You can tell me anything."
S07E09,JERRY,"Oh, uh...you see these jeans I'm wearing?"
S07E09,LENA,Yeah.
S07E09,JERRY,"I change the 32 waist on the label to a 31 on all my jeans. So, you know. That's it. (Lena is puzzled.)"
S07E09,SUSAN,"Come on, George, just tear it open."
S07E09,GEORGE,"I'm trying, dammit."
S07E09,SUSAN,Tear it.
S07E09,GEORGE,"I tried to tear it from the side, you can't get a good grip here. You gotta do it like a bag of chips."
S07E09,SUSAN,Here give it to me.
S07E09,GEORGE,Would you wait a second? Just wait? (They fight over it.)
S07E09,SUSAN,Give it to me. (She rips it open.) Come on. Come on!
S07E09,GEORGE (tosses the condom aside),It's too late.
S07E09,BOB,So! What's it going to be? Are you going to wear the ribbon?
S07E09,KRAMER (nervously),No! Never.
S07E09,BOB,But I am wearing the ribbon. He is wearing the ribbon. We are all wearing the ribbon! So why aren't you going to wear the ribbon!?
S07E09,KRAMER,This is America! I don't have to wear anything I don't want to wear!
S07E09,CEDRIC,What are we gonna do with him?
S07E09,BOB,I guess we are just going to have to teach him to wear the ribbon!
S07E09,JERRY,It completely turned her off.
S07E09,GEORGE,"Well, I can see that. What do you have to do that for? Who cares about your pants size?"
S07E09,JERRY,I don't wanna be a 32.
S07E09,GEORGE,I'd kill to be a 32.
S07E09,JERRY,She said I wasn't sponge-worthy. Wouldn't waste a sponge on me!
S07E09,GEORGE,That condom killed me. Why do they have to make the wrappers on those things so hard to open?
S07E09,JERRY,It's probably so the woman has one last chance to change her mind.
S07E09,GEORGE,"You never run out, do you? (Jerry smiles.) Where's Kramer? Everything's finished here."
S07E09,JERRY,"Oh, I told him he'd never make it. He was up all night! Oh my god...Kramer?"
S07E09,JERRY,Look at you. I told you. Up all night playing poker. Come on. (Jerry and George are about to leave. George turn's back and looks at Kramer.)
S07E09,GEORGE,"Hey, where's you AIDS ribbon?"
S07E09,ELAINE (smiling),Good morning.
S07E09,BILLY,How'd you sleep?
S07E09,ELAINE (stretches),Great. You?
S07E09,BILLY,"Fine, fine. Everything o.k.?"
S07E09,ELAINE,Yep.
S07E09,BILLY,No regrets?
S07E09,ELAINE,Nope. (Billy leans in to kiss her.) What are you doing?
S07E09,BILLY,What do you mean?
S07E09,ELAINE,Oh...I don't think so.
S07E09,BILLY,Why not? I thought you said everything was fine.
S07E09,ELAINE,"I wish I could help you, but I can't afford two of 'em. (Pats Billy on the shoulder and gets out of bed.)"
S07E10,GEORGE,You think she's happy?
S07E10,JERRY,Who?
S07E10,GEORGE,(indicates with his head) The cashier.
S07E10,JERRY,Ruthie Cohen?
S07E10,GEORGE,(surprised) You know her name?
S07E10,JERRY,Sure.
S07E10,GEORGE,I don't think I've ever spoken to her.
S07E10,JERRY,Maybe that's why she's happy.
S07E10,KRAMER,"(handing Jerry & George a flyer) Good morning, gentlemen."
S07E10,JERRY,What is this?
S07E10,KRAMER,"(removing his coat) Yeah, well, it's the latest offering from the Alex Theatre."
S07E10,JERRY,That stinky old movie-house?
S07E10,KRAMER,"(sits beside Jerry) Well, you should smell it now. We fixed up the place."
S07E10,GEORGE,(gesturing with flyer) With Spartacus?
S07E10,KRAMER,"(lighting his pipe) Well, it's a rare archival print. (jumps as his burns his fingers) Twelve extra minutes, full wide-screen CinemaScope, and if you come to the one o'clock show, you can hear Geoffrey Har-harwood."
S07E10,JERRY,Geoffrey who?
S07E10,KRAMER,"Har-harwood, Jerry. He was the assistant wardrobe man on Spartacus. Some fascinating insights into the production."
S07E10,GEORGE,Why would I spend seven dollars to see a movie that I could watch on TV?
S07E10,KRAMER,"Well, why go to a fine restaurant, when you can just stick something in the microwave? Why go to the park and fly a kite, when you can just pop a pill? (looks around Monk's) Listen, you guys haven't seen Lloyd Braun, have you? I'm supposed to meet him here."
S07E10,GEORGE,Lloyd Braun? What d'you have to meet him for?
S07E10,KRAMER,"Well, he's using his connections in the Mayor's office, to uh, get the theatre landmark status."
S07E10,JERRY,I thought he screwed up the Dinkins campaign.
S07E10,KRAMER,"Well, he did. You know, after that, he had a nervous breakdown? Had to spend a few months in an institution."
S07E10,GEORGE,Really?
S07E10,KRAMER,"Yeah, but he's doing a lot better now. I've taken him under my wing."
S07E10,JERRY,"Oh, then I'm not worried."
S07E10,KRAMER,"But he still needs all of our support. Now, when he gets here treat him like he's one of the gang, huh."
S07E10,GEORGE,"(thoughtful) Breakdown, huh?"
S07E10,LLOYD,Hey Kramer.
S07E10,KRAMER,"Oh, hey Lloyd, hey buddy. (gets up and shakes Lloyd's hand)"
S07E10,LLOYD,How you doing?
S07E10,KRAMER,(slaps Lloyd on the shoulder) Sit down. (sits himself)
S07E10,LLOYD,Hi Jerry.
S07E10,JERRY,Lloyd.
S07E10,LLOYD,George.
S07E10,GEORGE,"Hello, Lloyd. How you doing?"
S07E10,KRAMER,"Yeah well, he's doing fine, George."
S07E10,LLOYD,(offering packet) Gum?
S07E10,JERRY,(peering) That's an interesting package.
S07E10,LLOYD,"Yeah, it's from China. Go ahead, try a piece. Tell me that's not the most delicious gum you've ever tasted."
S07E10,KRAMER,"Yes, yes. We shall all try a piece and tell you how delicious it is. (he takes pieces for himself and Jerry)"
S07E10,LLOYD,George?
S07E10,GEORGE,I don't chew gum.
S07E10,JERRY,"(chewing) Mmm, different. Where'd you get it?"
S07E10,LLOYD,Friend of mine in Chinatown gave it to me. If you want I can ask him where he got it.
S07E10,JERRY,"Nah, don't bother."
S07E10,LLOYD,"No, it's no problem."
S07E10,JERRY,I don't want it.
S07E10,KRAMER,"Jerry, Jerry. Lloyd says it's no problem. He's capable of locating the gum."
S07E10,JERRY,Alright.
S07E10,KRAMER,"Mmm, delicious. This is delicious. Mmm."
S07E10,GEORGE,You know what? I think this Ruthie Cohen gave me the wrong change. Didn't I pay with a twenty? I'm sure I paid with a twenty.
S07E10,ELAINE,Hey.
S07E10,GEORGE,Hey.
S07E10,JERRY,I think I finally figured out what the flavor is in this gum. It's a little lo-mein-y. (he spits it into the waste bin)
S07E10,ELAINE,What kind is that?
S07E10,JERRY,"It's Chinese gum, Lloyd Braun gave me."
S07E10,ELAINE,Lloyd Braun? How's he doing?
S07E10,GEORGE,"(almost gleeful) After Dinkins lost the election, he had a complete nervous breakdown. They had to lock him up."
S07E10,ELAINE,"You know, that's around the same time I broke up with Lloyd. Y... you don't think that I had anything to do with his breakdown, do you?"
S07E10,JERRY,"You know, I remember when we parted company, I was babbling incoherently for months."
S07E10,ELAINE,"Yeah? Well, I got news for you."
S07E10,GEORGE,"The whole time that I was growing up, all I ever heard from my mother was 'Why can't you be more like that Lloyd Braun?'"
S07E10,JERRY,And in the end Lloyd Braun became more like you.
S07E10,GEORGE,"Right, gotta get going."
S07E10,JERRY,Aren't you coming with us to Spartacus?
S07E10,GEORGE,"Nah, I gotta deliver some Christmas presents to my parents."
S07E10,JERRY,I thought your parents were outta town?
S07E10,GEORGE,Why d'you think I'm going now?
S07E10,[Street,Queens]
S07E10,POP,Georgie!
S07E10,GEORGE,"Hey, Mr Lazzari."
S07E10,POP,"Back in the old neighborhood, ah?"
S07E10,GEORGE,"Yeah, yeah. Just delivering some presents to my folks."
S07E10,POP,"Oh, snazzy car. Le Baron?"
S07E10,GEORGE,"Yeah, eighty-three. Used to belong to John Voight."
S07E10,POP,"The actor, right?"
S07E10,GEORGE,Something like that.
S07E10,POP,Mind if I look under the hood?
S07E10,GEORGE,"Oh, no no no no. Go ahead, Pop, you always knew your cars."
S07E10,POP,"Oh, Deena! Deena, Deena, l... look who's here."
S07E10,DEENA,"George Costanza, is that you?"
S07E10,GEORGE,"Hey Deena, come on, give us a hug. (they hug) Oh my gosh, you look as pretty as you did back in high school."
S07E10,DEENA,"Boy, those were some crazy times."
S07E10,GEORGE,"Yeah, yeah. Speaking of crazy, did you hear about Lloyd Braun?"
S07E10,[Alex Theatre,Lobby]
S07E10,KRAMER,"The Alex was built in nineteen twenty-two, during the golden era of movie palaces. Minor restorations in nineteen forty-one, forty-seven, fifty-two, fifty-eight, sixty-three, and currently to our present period of time."
S07E10,ELAINE,"Boy, you're really getting into this aren't you?"
S07E10,KRAMER,"Yes, yes I am. The icing on the cake would be getting that landmark status from the City. We're hoping Lloyd Braun can pull a few strings."
S07E10,JERRY,"Oh, can Lloyd really do that?"
S07E10,KRAMER,"Lloyd Braun can do anything he puts his mind to. He's fine, Jerry. (to Elaine) And you should say hello to him, Elaine."
S07E10,ELAINE,(concerned) What? Lloyd is here?
S07E10,ELAINE,"What? No, no, I'd rather..."
S07E10,LLOYD,Hi Elaine.
S07E10,ELAINE,"(big fake smile) Lloyd, yes. Hello."
S07E10,LLOYD,"Kramer tell you? We reserved some special seats, so we can all sit together."
S07E10,ELAINE,"(reluctant) Oh, well... I, uh, actually Lloyd, Jerry and I have to sit in the front row, uhm, (desperately inventing) because uh, because, because he, he forgot his glasses. So uh, thanks for getting us... uhm, we'll see you afterwards."
S07E10,LLOYD,"That was odd. Am I crazy, or does Jerry not wear glasses?"
S07E10,KRAMER,"(emphatic) You're not crazy. Jerry does wear glasses. He just forgot 'em, that's all. (puts an arm round Lloyd's shoulder) Not crazy."
S07E10,[Alex Theatre,Auditorium]
S07E10,JERRY,We're all the way in the front row. Why couldn't we sit in the special seats?
S07E10,ELAINE,"I'm sorry, but I didn't want Lloyd thinking I was leading him on again. Seeing him made me feel very uncomfortable."
S07E10,JERRY,"Nah, you don't wanna be uncomfortable."
S07E10,[Street,Queens]
S07E10,DEENA,Poor Lloyd.
S07E10,GEORGE,I know. Completely bonkers!
S07E10,DEENA,"Sorry I can't be so flip about this kind of thing. You know, after what happened to Pop."
S07E10,GEORGE,Pop? What happened to Pop?
S07E10,DEENA,I thought you heard. He had a nervous breakdown last year. That's why I'm taking care of him.
S07E10,POP,"Oh, I tell you, they don't build 'em like this any more."
S07E10,GEORGE,"(a little worried) He uh, he doesn't have the auto shop any more?"
S07E10,DEENA,"Uhn, it was too much for him."
S07E10,GEORGE,"(very worried) Uhm, I, I gotta go."
S07E10,DEENA,What?
S07E10,GEORGE,"I just remembered, I gotta be someplace. Yuh-hu-hur, that's enough. Pop. Pop, put down the wrench, Pop."
S07E10,[Alex Theatre,Auditorium]
S07E10,GEORGE,Pop! POP!!
S07E10,[Alex Theatre,Lobby]
S07E10,LLOYD,"'s a great movie, huh?"
S07E10,KRAMER,Yeah.
S07E10,LLOYD,Sorry you forgot those glasses.
S07E10,JERRY,I don't know what I was thinking.
S07E10,LLOYD,How'd you like that gum?
S07E10,JERRY,(noncommittal) Errh.
S07E10,KRAMER,"(slapping Jerry on the back) Ah, he loved it."
S07E10,ELAINE,"Hey Kramer, you know what? There, there isn't a light there, in the ladies' room."
S07E10,KRAMER,"Yeah, yeah. It's being repaired."
S07E10,ELAINE,Oh. Oh God.
S07E10,LLOYD,You alright?
S07E10,ELAINE,"Ah, I sat too close to the screen. Oh. I just gotta stretch out in a hot bath. It was nice to see you again, Lloyd."
S07E10,ELAINE,"Officer. Officer, is there some reason this man has to always be using a hose? I mean, he's flooding the sidewalk. It's a waste of water. Couldn't he just use a broom?"
S07E10,COP,"Lady, you sold me. (strides toward florist) Hey, you with the hose."
S07E10,KRAMER,"Yeah, put these glasses on."
S07E10,JERRY,"(taking them) Well, what's this for?"
S07E10,KRAMER,"Yeah, well Lloyd, he's gonna be here any minute now."
S07E10,JERRY,So what?
S07E10,KRAMER,"Well, he thinks you wear those."
S07E10,KRAMER,They're from the lost and found at the Alex.
S07E10,JERRY,"Aw, c'mon Kramer, this is ridiculous. I'm not gonna put these on."
S07E10,KRAMER,"Oh. Okay. So he'll just think that the two of you didn't sit with him on purpose. Ooh yeah, that's very nice. Very nice."
S07E10,GEORGE,"'scuse me. I uh, I was in here this morning and uh, I believe I paid you with a twenty dollar bill, (smiles) but you only gave me change for a ten."
S07E10,CASHIER,I don't think so.
S07E10,GEORGE,"Oh, I think so, and I can prove it. You see, I was doodling on the bill and uh, so if you have a twenty in there with big lips on it... well, (smiles) that's mine. Would you mind opening up the register?"
S07E10,CASHIER,Not unless you buy something.
S07E10,GEORGE,"Fine, I'll buy a pack of gum."
S07E10,LLOYD,Hey George. Thought you didn't chew gum?
S07E10,GEORGE,I don't.
S07E10,CASHIER,Take a look.
S07E10,GEORGE,I know I gave it to you.
S07E10,LLOYD,"George, would you mind. I'm kind of in a hurry."
S07E10,GEORGE,(frustrated) Fine. Fine. (to customer) Excuse me. (heading for the door) Think I'm gonna forget about this? I haven't forgotten about this. I don't forget that easily!
S07E10,KRAMER,"Hey, Jerry, look who's here."
S07E10,JERRY,"Ah, Lloyd."
S07E10,LLOYD,Hi Jerry. Got some more of that gum.
S07E10,JERRY,"(unenthusiastic) Oh, the gum."
S07E10,KRAMER,"Yeah, let's all enjoy a chew, huh?"
S07E10,JERRY,"(still not happy) Uh, alright. (he takes a piece)"
S07E10,KRAMER,"Oh, boy."
S07E10,KRAMER,"Now see, this is what the holidays are all about. Three buddies, sitting around, chewing gum, huh? Mmm, mmm, yeah. So uh, you know, Lloyd, he thinks he can get more of this."
S07E10,JERRY,"Well, Lloyd's a very industrious fellow. I'm sure he can accomplish anything he sets his mind to."
S07E10,LLOYD,"Actually, the importer's right in Chinatown. I'll introduce you to him, you can get it whenever you want."
S07E10,JERRY,'s not necessary.
S07E10,KRAMER,"Hey, Jerry, you know, Lloyd wants to do you a favour."
S07E10,JERRY,"I know that, Kramer."
S07E10,LLOYD,"Well, if you don't want to..."
S07E10,KRAMER,"No, sure sure, he wants to. It's very kind of you. Yeah, Jerry, he appreciates it. Don't you, Jerry?"
S07E10,JERRY,"Yes I do, Kramer."
S07E10,LLOYD,So...
S07E10,KRAMER,Yeah?
S07E10,LLOYD,"How about that Elaine today, huh?"
S07E10,KRAMER,"Oh, baby, what was that all about, huh?"
S07E10,LLOYD,(to Jerry) She was practically undressing in front of me at the theatre.
S07E10,JERRY,I didn't see anything.
S07E10,KRAMER,"Yeah, you uh, really missed a show, buddy. Wooh, ba-boom, ba-boom-ba-ba-ba-boom-ba."
S07E10,DEENA,You're probably wondering why I wanted to see you again.
S07E10,GEORGE,"Well, you know. (grins, snorts) It's understandable."
S07E10,DEENA,"I'm glad you feel that way. Because since my father's breakdown I uh, become very sensitive to the warning signs."
S07E10,GEORGE,Warning signs?
S07E10,DEENA,"Nervousness, irritability, paranoia."
S07E10,GEORGE,"(disbelief) What? (laugh) Wh... what're you talking about? I'm not the one with the problem. (defensive) Lloyd Braun was in the nuthouse, not me."
S07E10,DEENA,"Yet again, taking pleasure in the misfortunes of others."
S07E10,GEORGE,All my friends do that.
S07E10,DEENA,"George, I'm only trying to help..."
S07E10,DEENA,"I'm... I'm concerned. George? George, are you listening to me?"
S07E10,GEORGE,You see that woman on the horse? (points)
S07E10,GEORGE,"She stole twenty dollars from me. (getting angry) Yeah, I might've gotten it back, but Lloyd Braun interfered!"
S07E10,DEENA,So again it all comes back to Lloyd.
S07E10,GEORGE,"(rising to his feet) Hey! Hey, you! (setting off after her) Come back here!! Don't gallop away!!"
S07E10,JERRY,So you say she was on a horse?
S07E10,GEORGE,"I'm telling you, that cashier is riding horses on my money."
S07E10,JERRY,"Well, here's what I propose. Go down to the stables, snoop around. See if any high-flying cashier's been throwing twenty dollar bills around with big lips."
S07E10,ELAINE,Hey.
S07E10,JERRY,"Well, if it isn't Chesty La Rue."
S07E10,ELAINE,(sits beside Jerry) What?
S07E10,JERRY,"I was chewing gum with Lloyd Braun, and he was bragging about the peepshow you gave him at the Alex."
S07E10,ELAINE,"(laughing it away) Oh God. I lost a button, so my blouse was wide open. I musta left it at the theatre."
S07E10,JERRY,Maybe it's in the lost and found.
S07E10,ELAINE,"Yeah, I know. I have to go check it out. It's a beautiful button too, you know. It's antique ivory. It was my mother's."
S07E10,JERRY,"You know, the way you were wolfing down that popcorn, maybe you ate it."
S07E10,[Alex Theatre,Lobby]
S07E10,KRAMER,"Mr Har-harwood. Well, what an unexpected surprise to have you back at the Alex Theatre."
S07E10,HAARWOOD,"Well I, I'm in a bit of a quandary. I've misplaced my spectacles."
S07E10,KRAMER,"Well, let's look in lost and found, shall we?"
S07E10,HAARWOOD,They're half-glasses.
S07E10,KRAMER,Brown?
S07E10,HAARWOOD,"Mmm, yes, yes."
S07E10,KRAMER,"Uh, yeah. Ah, well if they're not in the box, I'm sure they'll turn up soon. Listen, could you keep an eye on the place? I wanna go out and get some paraffin wax, and bring out the lustre of this vintage countertop."
S07E10,HAARWOOD,Certainly.

S07E10,DEENA,And I suppose Lloyd Braun had something to do with it too.

S07E10,LLOYD,Yeah. A hundred dollar's worth.
S07E10,JERRY,(incredulous) I gave you a hundred dollars?!
S07E10,LLOYD,"You sure did. Am I crazy, or is that a lotta gum?"
S07E10,JERRY,It's a lotta gum!
S07E10,KRAMER,Mr Hararwood. Found your glasses.
S07E10,HAARWOOD,"Oh, splendid. Welcome to the Institute for the Preservation of Motion Picture Costumes and Wardrobe."
S07E10,KRAMER,"Ah, the I.P.M.P.C.W."
S07E10,HAARWOOD,"Well eh, we prefer to call it the Institute."
S07E10,KRAMER,Is that from Henry the Eighth?
S07E10,HAARWOOD,"Yes, yes, it is."
S07E10,KRAMER,"Well, you know, we're screening that tonight at the Alex. Do you think that I could wear that to promote the theatre?"
S07E10,HAARWOOD,"Well, I... I'd love to lend it to you, but I doubt if it would fit a man of your impressive, Raymond Massey-like, physique. The only person who could really fit into this costume, would have to be a short, stocky, man of somewhat generous proportions."
S07E10,KRAMER,(an idea occurs) You don't say.
S07E10,KRAMER,"You're really helping me out with this, buddy. Kids are gonna be so thrilled."
S07E10,GEORGE,"Yeah, yeah. You really cashed in on that favor pretty quick."
S07E10,KRAMER,"Remember, you're a king, you must project a Royal bearing."
S07E10,GEORGE,"(angry undertone) Oh, I'm gonna give you a Royal bearing. Wait a minute, wait a minute. Lemme get a pack of gum here."
S07E10,GEORGE,"(handing over a bill) Can I get a pack of gum, please?"
S07E10,GUY,"I beg your pardon, your majesty, but we don't accept bills with lipstick on the president."
S07E10,GEORGE,"What? Huh, so I had it all along. How d'you like that? (snorts) I guess I owe that cashier an apology."
S07E10,DEENA,Oh my God!
S07E10,GEORGE,"No, no. Deena, it's not what you think."
S07E10,GEORGE,Th... this isn't mine.
S07E10,GEORGE,I got it from the Institute. The Institute.
S07E10,GEORGE,(shouting) Dee... Deena!
S07E10,[Alex Theatre,Lobby]
S07E10,KRAMER,"Ahh, Mr Haarwood. Well, you certainly know how to dress for a premiere."
S07E10,HAARWOOD,"Well, thank you. Uh, where is your friend King Henry?"
S07E10,KRAMER,"Oh, he ran away."
S07E10,LLOYD,Hey Kramer.
S07E10,KRAMER,I need to talk to you.
S07E10,ELAINE,"You know, that button looks very familiar."
S07E10,HAARWOOD,"Yes, it, it, it's antique ivory."
S07E10,ELAINE,"I, I think that's my button. (wanders over to Haarwood) You know, I've been looking all over for it. Did, did you find it here?"
S07E10,HAARWOOD,"Yes, it was in the lost and found."
S07E10,ELAINE,Shall I undo it?
S07E10,HAARWOOD,"Oh yes, of course you can."
S07E10,ELAINE,"Oh, thank you."
S07E10,HAARWOOD,I'm a little ticklish.
S07E10,ELAINE,"Oh. (giggly) Tickle, tickle."
S07E10,LLOYD,We've really gotta get that Elaine a boyfriend.
S07E10,KRAMER,"Oh, tell me about it."
S07E11,ELAINE,"(thinking) I can't believe I'm going out with this guy. Wow! He's so cool. Maybe he'll write a song about me. That would be amazing. Oh, Elaine, you are so beautiful. So, so beautiful. Not so mention your personality which is so, so, interesting. If you want, you can quit your job and never work again."
S07E11,ELAINE,"Jerry, you have got to come see him. He is so terrific."
S07E11,JERRY,Maybe he'll write a song about you.
S07E11,ELAINE,Yeah. Right. (laughing) Like that really matters.
S07E11,JERRY,So I take it he's spongeworthy?
S07E11,ELAINE,"Oh, yeah."
S07E11,JERRY,"Well, he's a musician. I guess they're supposed to be very, you know, uninhibited and free."
S07E11,ELAINE,"Well, actually, he's - he's not that way at all."
S07E11,JERRY,"Oh, no?"
S07E11,ELAINE,"Yeah. In fact, he....(moaning)"
S07E11,JERRY,Come on. Come on.
S07E11,ELAINE,I don't wanna!
S07E11,JERRY,"Elaine, you're among friends."
S07E11,ELAINE,"(sighs) Well, actually, he, um, doesn't really like to do... everything."
S07E11,JERRY,Oh.
S07E11,ELAINE,Yeah. It's surprising.
S07E11,JERRY,"Yes, it is. It is surprising. Does that bother you?"
S07E11,ELAINE,"No. No, it doesn't bother me. I mean, it would be nice. I'm not gonna lie to you and say it wouldn't be nice."
S07E11,JERRY,Sure. Why not? You're there.
S07E11,ELAINE,Exactly.
S07E11,JERRY,"But you said he was just coming out of a very serious relationship. Maybe he's, you know, still....kind of...he...not gonna happen."
S07E11,KRAMER,"Hey, Jerry! Listen, I need you to come downstairs, help me get my stuff outta the car."
S07E11,JERRY,What stuff?
S07E11,KRAMER,"I just came from the price club. I'm loaded up, baby."
S07E11,JERRY,"All right. What are you, outta your mind? Look at this. What did you buy here? You will never be able to finish all this stuff."
S07E11,KRAMER,Course I will. These are staples.
S07E11,JERRY,A four-pound can of black olives? That's a staple?
S07E11,KRAMER,"Lindsay olives, Jerry."
S07E11,JERRY,A forty-eight pack of Eggo waffles? A gallon of barbecue sauce? Ten pounds of cocktail meatballs?
S07E11,KRAMER,$17.50. You can't beat that.
S07E11,JERRY,Look...look at this can of tuna!
S07E11,KRAMER,"Yeah. Star Kist, Jerry. Most tuna don't make their cut."
S07E11,JERRY,This isn't for a person. This is for Biosphere 3.
S07E11,KRAMER,"Hey, Clyde!"
S07E11,CLYDE,"Hey, Kramer! What's happening, dude?"
S07E11,KRAMER,"Yeah. Ahh. Hey, this is Jerry here."
S07E11,CLYDE,How ya doin'?
S07E11,JERRY,Hi.
S07E11,KRAMER,"You know, Clyde, he plays backup with John Germaine."
S07E11,JERRY,John Germaine? That is amazing. I was just talking about him upstairs with Elaine.
S07E11,CLYDE,Oh yeah?
S07E11,JERRY,"Oh, yeah. My friend Elaine and him are goin' out. They're pretty hot and heavy."
S07E11,CLYDE,Is that right?
S07E11,KRAMER,"Hey, how 'bout giving me a hand? You know, bring some of this stuff upstairs."
S07E11,CLYDE,"Oh, sorry Kramer, I got to watch the hands. My hands are my life."
S07E11,ESTELLE,"Georgie, can you zip me up?"
S07E11,GEORGE,"Yeah. Yeah, one second."
S07E11,ESTELLE,"Well, come on!"
S07E11,GEORGE,All right. All right. Let's not get into panic mode! Let's not make a big deal outta this thing or we're never gonna get through this night.
S07E11,ESTELLE,"Well, I'm meeting your in-laws, I think I should look nice."
S07E11,GEORGE,"My in-laws. Oh, my...."
S07E11,FRANK,"So, what do you think? Your old man can look pretty good when he wants to, huh?"
S07E11,ESTELLE,I don't like that tie.
S07E11,FRANK,What's the matter with this tie? I've hardly worn it.
S07E11,ESTELLE,It's too thin. They're wearing wide now.
S07E11,FRANK,How do you know what kind of ties they wear?
S07E11,ESTELLE,Go to any office building on 7th Avenue and tell me if there's anyone there wearing a thin tie like that. Go ahead!
S07E11,FRANK,"Oh, get the hell outta here. 7th Avenue."
S07E11,ESTELLE,"George, do you think he should wear a tie like that?"
S07E11,FRANK,Huh?
S07E11,GEORGE,I think he should wear whatever tie he wants.
S07E11,FRANK,We gotta stop off and pick up a marble rye from Schnitzer's.
S07E11,ESTELLE,It's out of our way. Why can't we pick up something at Lord's? It's right over here.
S07E11,FRANK,No! We have to go to Schnitzer's! I'll show these people something about taste!
S07E11,GEORGE,This is gonna be fun.
S07E11,JERRY,"Hey, you'll never guess who I bumped into. This guy Clyde. He's in your friend John Germaine's band there."
S07E11,ELAINE,So what did he have to say?
S07E11,JERRY,Nothing. I told him you two were pretty hot and heavy.
S07E11,ELAINE,Hot and heavy? You said hot and heavy?
S07E11,JERRY,Yeah.
S07E11,ELAINE,What did you do that for?
S07E11,JERRY,What?
S07E11,ELAINE,What if he tells John? Then John's gonna think that I think that we're hot and heavy. I don't want John thinking that I'm hot and heavy if he's not hot and heavy.
S07E11,JERRY,Oh
S07E11,ELAINE,"I'm trying to get a little squirrel to come over to me here. I don't wanna make any big, sudden movements. I'll frighten him away."
S07E11,JERRY,"Well, Clyde might not tell him."
S07E11,ELAINE,How do you know that?
S07E11,JERRY,I should have helped Kramer with those packages.
S07E11,ELAINE,Ohh!
S07E11,DENNIS,"Let me give you a hand. Hey, Kramer. I wonder, could you do me a favor? I'm taking the family to Disneyworld next week. I wonder..."
S07E11,KRAMER,Uh-huh.
S07E11,DENNIS,"I wonder, could you pick up my mail?"
S07E11,KRAMER,Yeah. Sure. Sure.
S07E11,DENNIS,"In fact, you know what, how would you like to take my hansom cab for the week?"
S07E11,KRAMER,Drive the horse?
S07E11,DENNIS,It'll just be sitting there. You can really clean up. 500 bucks a day. I'll split it with ya.
S07E11,KRAMER,"Oh, giddyup. Yeah."
S07E11,GEORGE,"This is delicious, Mrs. Ross."
S07E11,MRS. ROSS,Oh.
S07E11,MR. ROSS,What are you complimenting her for? She didn't make it Rowenna did.
S07E11,FRANK,What is this thing anyway?
S07E11,MRS. ROSS,It's Cornish gamehen.
S07E11,FRANK,"What is that, like a little chicken?"
S07E11,GEORGE,"It's, uh, it's not a little chicken. (laughing) Little chicken. It's a gamebird."
S07E11,FRANK,Gamebird?
S07E11,GEORGE,Yeah.
S07E11,FRANK,"What do you mean? Like, you - you hunt it?"
S07E11,MR. ROSS,Yes.
S07E11,FRANK,How hard could it be to kill this thing?
S07E11,ESTELLE,I couldn't help but notice that you have quite a library in there.
S07E11,MRS. ROSS,"If I had a dime for every book he's actually read, (laughing) I'd be broke."
S07E11,SUSAN,More wine anyone?
S07E11,FRANK,Yeah. I'll take some.
S07E11,SUSAN,Hmmm?
S07E11,FRANK,Thank you.
S07E11,SUSAN,How do you like the Merlot?
S07E11,ESTELLE,Merlot? I never heard of it. Did they just invent it?
S07E11,MRS. ROSS,"Oh, mother."
S07E11,GEORGE,"She's, uh, she's heard of Merlot."
S07E11,FRANK,"Let me understand, you got the hen, the chicken and the rooster. The rooster goes with the chicken. So, who's having sex with the hen?"
S07E11,GEORGE,Why don't we talk about it another time.
S07E11,FRANK,"But you see my point here? You only hear of a hen, a rooster and a chicken. Something's missing!"
S07E11,MRS. ROSS,Something's missing all right.
S07E11,MR. ROSS,They're all chickens. The rooster has sex with all of them.
S07E11,FRANK,That's perverse.
S07E11,GEORGE,Did anybody see Firestorm?
S07E11,MR. ROSS,"Firestorm, that's a hell of a picture."
S07E11,GEORGE,Yeah.
S07E11,MR. ROSS,Remember when they had the helicopter land on top of that car --
S07E11,FRANK,Hey! Hey! Come on! Come on! I haven't seen it yet.
S07E11,MR. ROSS,It doesn't have anything to do with the plot!
S07E11,FRANK,Still! Still! I like to go in fresh!
S07E11,GEORGE,Oh mother of God.
S07E11,KRAMER,"Of course, uh, this is Central Park. Uh, this was designed in 1850 by Joe Peppitone. Um, built during the Civil War so the northern armies could practice fighting on...on grass. Oh, yeah. Giddyup. On Rusty!"
S07E11,JOHN,"Thank you. Now, I'd like to play something th -- well, actually, it's my latest so it's nice and fresh. It's called "" Hot And Heavy."""
S07E11,GEORGE,Thank God that's over.
S07E11,ESTELLE,The mother seems to hit the sauce pretty hard. I didn't like that.
S07E11,FRANK,And who doesn't serve cake after a meal? What kind of people? Would it kill them to put out a pound cake? Something!
S07E11,GEORGE,"So, they didn't give you a piece of cake? Big deal."
S07E11,ESTELLE,It is a big deal. You're supposed to serve cake after a meal. I'm sorry. It's impolite.
S07E11,FRANK,"Not impolite...it's stupid, that's what it is. You gotta be stupid to do something like that!"
S07E11,ESTELLE,Your father's absolutely right. We're sitting there like idiots drinking coffee without a piece of cake!
S07E11,GEORGE,What is this? The marble rye?
S07E11,MRS. ROSS,"Oh, dear. I forgot to put out that - that bread they brought."
S07E11,ESTELLE,We forgot to bring it in.
S07E11,FRANK,"No, I brought it in. They never put it out."
S07E11,MRS. ROSS,Where is it?
S07E11,SUSAN,I don't know. Where'd you put it?
S07E11,MRS. ROSS,Right over there.
S07E11,SUSAN,"Well, it's gone."
S07E11,GEORGE,You stole the bread?
S07E11,FRANK,What do you mean stole? It's my bread. They didn't eat it. Why should I leave it there?
S07E11,GEORGE,Because we brought it for them!
S07E11,FRANK,"Apparently, it wasn't good enough for them to serve."
S07E11,MRS. ROSS,Is it possible they took it back?
S07E11,SUSAN,Who would bring a bread and take it back?
S07E11,MR. ROSS,"Those people, that's who. I think they're sick."
S07E11,ESTELLE,People take buses to get that rye.
S07E11,GEORGE,Maybe they forgot to put it out!
S07E11,FRANK,"Aw, they didn't forget to put it out! It's deliberate! Deliberate, I tell ya!"
S07E11,JERRY,He stole back the rye?
S07E11,GEORGE,Yeah.
S07E11,JERRY,Why?
S07E11,GEORGE,Why? Why? 'Cause he's off his rocker! That's why.
S07E11,JERRY,"So, do the Ross's know?"
S07E11,GEORGE,I don't know. They're all very suspicious.
S07E11,JERRY,Why wouldn't they be? A rye bread doesn't just disappear.
S07E11,GEORGE,"Now, because of that stupid rye bread, I gotta keep them all separated for the rest of my life."
S07E11,JERRY,Bad situation.
S07E11,GEORGE,I'll tell you what I'd like to do. I'd like to replace that rye.
S07E11,JERRY,What do you mean replace it?
S07E11,GEORGE,"You know, you go out, you get another rye. Of course, it would have to be the same one from Schnitzer's. You put it in the kitchen somewhere and you say Ohh! There it is."
S07E11,JERRY,"Well, there ya go. What's so hard about that?"
S07E11,GEORGE,What's so hard about that? How am I supposed to get it in there? I can't just walk in with it. I have to get the Rosses out of the apartment!
S07E11,JERRY,"All right. All right. Don't panic. Let's just think about it. Get the Ross's out of the apartment. That can't be so hard. Wait a minute. Wait a second. Wait a second! You know, Kramer's been driving that hansom cab."
S07E11,GEORGE,So?
S07E11,JERRY,"Well, Kramer'll take them around for a while."
S07E11,GEORGE,And it's their anniversary Friday night. I could send them for a hansom cab ride. Y -- you think they'd like that?
S07E11,JERRY,"Are you kidding? People love it. There's something about the clip clop, clip clop. They're nuts for it."
S07E11,GEORGE,"So, they go off for the ride, by the time they come back the bread is there."
S07E11,JERRY,What about Susan?
S07E11,GEORGE,She's working late that night. We're - were supposed to have dinner with everybody at eight o'clock so I'll set up the ride for seven o'clock.
S07E11,JERRY,Beautiful!
S07E11,GEORGE,You think Kramer'll do it?
S07E11,KRAMER,"Of course I'll do it. I'd be happy to. So, all I gotta do is be there at seven?"
S07E11,GEORGE,Yeah. Just take 'em out and ride 'em around for about..half an hour.
S07E11,KRAMER,Hey.
S07E11,JERRY,What the hell are you doing there?
S07E11,KRAMER,It's Beef-A-Reeno..and I got fifty cans. You want some?
S07E11,JERRY,No. No thanks.
S07E11,KRAMER,"Jerry, I think I bought too much at that price club. I don't have any room for it all."
S07E11,GEORGE,Hold on. Hold on. Wait a minute. How am I gonna get the rye bread into the apartment?
S07E11,JERRY,Just put it under your shirt.
S07E11,GEORGE,Have you ever seen a Schnitzer's rye? It - it's huge!
S07E11,JERRY,"I'll tell ya what, I'll bring it over. I'll stop by Schnitzer's, I'll come by five after seven right after they leave."
S07E11,GEORGE,"Oh, this is all locking in now. It is all locking in! (laughing)"
S07E11,ELAINE,Hey. Is that your horse outside?
S07E11,KRAMER,Yeah. That's Rusty.
S07E11,GEORGE,What? He's outside?
S07E11,KRAMER,Uh-huh.
S07E11,GEORGE,"Aw, come on. I wanna go see him."
S07E11,KRAMER,You wanna go see him?
S07E11,GEORGE,Yeah. Hey! Hey!
S07E11,KRAMER,I'll show ya Rusty.
S07E11,GEORGE,"Hey, Lainey, wanna see the horsey?"
S07E11,ELAINE,"Well, you really did me in this time, didn't ya? First guy I like in a really long time. I mean, we're getting along, everything is just great. I mean, all right, so he doesn't do... everything, and then you have to come along with your hot and your heavy."
S07E11,JERRY,"So, you think Clyde told him?"
S07E11,ELAINE,He wrote a song about it!
S07E11,JERRY,"Well, maybe it's a good thing."
S07E11,ELAINE,No! It's not a good thing! It's a bad thing! Do you know what this is like? To have no control over a relationship? And - and you feel sick to your stomach all the time? Do you know what that's like?
S07E11,JERRY,"No, but I've read articles and I must say it, doesn't sound very pleasant."
S07E11,ELAINE,"You know, one of these days, something terrible is gonna happen to you. It has to!"
S07E11,JERRY,"No. I'm gonna be just fine, but as far as your situation, you're seeing him tonight so talk to him about it."
S07E11,ELAINE,"I can't! He's got a big showcase for record producers at his late show tonight. I don't wanna upset him. Aw, what the hell, I'll upset him."
S07E11,MR. ROSS,"Yeah George, I gotta tell ya, this is a very nice gesture. We really appreciate it."
S07E11,GEORGE,"Aw, well, you know, it's your anniversary. It's - it's the least I can do. I - I just want you guys to go out and have a good time. Ha ha. So, you think we should, uh, we should get downstairs?"
S07E11,MR. ROSS,"Oh, we got about twenty minutes. You, uh, seem a little nervous George. Anything wrong?"
S07E11,GEORGE,"Oh, no. No. No. No. No. Nothing. I'm fine. Everything's fine. Fine. Just get a little nervous on the weekends, that's all. Could I, uh, could I get a glass of water?"
S07E11,MRS. ROSS,"We've got water. I don't think we have any bread, but we've got water."
S07E11,KRAMER,Yeah. There ya go. That's Beef-A-Reeno. (singing) I'm so keen-o On Beef-A-Reeno What a delicious cuisine-o Fit for a king and queen-o! Yeah. Eat up. I got thirty four more cans.
S07E11,MR. ROSS,"Nice night for a hansom cab ride, 'ay George?"
S07E11,MRS. ROSS,"You know, George we haven't done anything romantic like this in ....years."
S07E11,GEORGE,"(thinking) Oh my God, it's 701. What have I done? My whole plan is depending on Kramer? Have I learned nothing? How could I make such a stupid mistake? He'll never show up!"
S07E11,KRAMER,Ah ha!
S07E11,GEORGE,There he is. Right on time as usual.
S07E11,COUNTER WOMAN,53.
S07E11,MABEL,"53. I'd like a marble rye, no plastic, in a bag."
S07E11,COUNTER WOMAN,Ah! You're lucky. It's our last one.
S07E11,JERRY,"Wait a second, that's your last marble rye?"
S07E11,COUNTER WOMAN,That's right.
S07E11,JERRY,There's none left?
S07E11,COUNTER WOMAN,That's what I said. Number 54.
S07E11,JERRY,"Uh, excuse me. I know this is gonna sound crazy but I - I have to have that rye. It's a - it's a long story, but a person's whole future may depend on it."
S07E11,MABEL,"Well, I'm sorry, but you should have got here earlier."
S07E11,JERRY,"Yes. Well, be that as it may, if you could just find it in yourself to give it up."
S07E11,MABEL,You're not getting this rye --
S07E11,JERRY,"All right. All right. I'll tell ya what I'm gonna do, I will give you double what you paid for it."
S07E11,MABEL,You're in my way!
S07E11,KRAMER,Ahh! Mr. Ross. Mrs. Ross. My name is Cosmo and I'll be your driver for this evening. We have blankets for your comfort. I also have hot chocolate if the mood should strike you.
S07E11,MRS. ROSS,My favorite.
S07E11,KRAMER,"Well, if we're all set to go, why don't you two hop aboard and let me show you a little taste of old New York...the way it once was. Oh, happy anniversary. On, Rusty!"
S07E11,JERRY,"All right. Look, I'll tell ya what, I'll give you $50. Now, be reasonable you cannot turn down $50 for a $6 rye."
S07E11,MABEL,No? Watch me.
S07E11,JERRY,Give me that rye!
S07E11,MABEL,Stop it!
S07E11,JERRY,"I want that rye, lady!"
S07E11,MABEL,Help! Someone help!
S07E11,JERRY,"Shut up, you old bag!"
S07E11,MABEL,Stop thief! Stop him! He's got my marble rye!
S07E11,ELAINE,"I'm sorry to just show up unexpectedly like this. I know you've got your big showcase coming up later and I know how important it is, I know how hard you work for this night, but I just had to tell you that I never told Jerry hot and heavy. I didn't think we were hot and heavy. I mean - I mean, who's hot and who's heavy?"
S07E11,JOHN,"Whoa. Hold on, Elaine I.....I'm kinda disappointed."
S07E11,ELAINE,Disappointed?
S07E11,JOHN,"Yeah. I mean, I was excited when Clyde told me that."
S07E11,ELAINE,You were?
S07E11,JOHN,Absolutely.
S07E11,ELAINE,Ohh! Whew! I am so relieved!
S07E11,JOHN,"Listen, uh, I've still got a couple of hours to kill before the next show. My place is only a few blocks from here."
S07E11,ELAINE,Really?
S07E11,JOHN,And you know what?
S07E11,ELAINE,What?
S07E11,JOHN,"I've been thinking about what we do and I'm thinking..of...adding a new number to my, you know, repertoire."
S07E11,ELAINE,Ohh!
S07E11,KRAMER,Y'aah!
S07E11,MRS. ROSS,(sniffing) What is that?
S07E11,MR. ROSS,I think it's the horse.
S07E11,MRS. ROSS,"Oh, God."
S07E11,KRAMER,"Hey, how's everything? You..you need anything?"
S07E11,MRS. ROSS,This is - this is...horrible.
S07E11,MR. ROSS,"Excuse me,...what do you feed this animal?"
S07E11,KRAMER,"Oh, you know, oats and hay. You know, they like that stuff."
S07E11,MRS. ROSS,I can't take this. Let me out of this thing!
S07E11,MR. ROSS,Turn this thing around. We've had it. We can't breathe back here! And hurry it up!
S07E11,KRAMER,Rusty! Rusty!
S07E11,GEORGE,(whistling)
S07E11,KRAMER,Whoa!
S07E11,GEORGE,Wha - what happened? What are you doing back so soon?
S07E11,MR. ROSS,Ask Rusty.
S07E11,KRAMER,"I'm terribly sorry, Mr. Ross. One never knows how the gastrointestinal workings of the equine are going to function."
S07E11,MRS. ROSS,"Thanks for nothing! Come on, George. Let's go upstairs."
S07E11,GEORGE,What the hell happened?
S07E11,KRAMER,The horse is gassy. Must have been the Beef-A-Reeno.
S07E11,GEORGE,Beef-A-Reeno? You fed the horse Beef-A-Reeno?!
S07E11,KRAMER,"Well, I overbought!"
S07E11,MR. ROSS,George.
S07E11,GEORGE,(muttering)
S07E11,MUSIC GUY,What's going on? Where is he?
S07E11,MANAGER,Uh...he'll be here soon.
S07E11,MUSIC GUY,I'll give him ten more minutes. I'm not gonna stay here all night.
S07E11,JERRY,How much did you give him?
S07E11,KRAMER,"Just a can. But he really liked it, though."
S07E11,GEORGE,Jerry! Up here!
S07E11,JERRY,"Yeah. Hey, what do you want me to do with this?"
S07E11,GEORGE,I can't come out. They're standing right by the door. Throw it up!
S07E11,JERRY,Really?
S07E11,GEORGE,"Yeah. Yeah. It's the only way. Come on. What are you, kidding me?"
S07E11,JERRY,Will you get this horse outta here. He's killing me. I can't get any oxygen.
S07E11,KRAMER,I don't wanna go back on there!
S07E11,GEORGE,Come on!
S07E11,JERRY,(grunting as he throws bread into the air)
S07E11,GEORGE,"(grunting) Hey! Hey, wait a second. I got an idea."
S07E11,ELAINE,"No. No. Don't be silly, John, you were very good. You just don't have to try so hard. Good luck, honey."
S07E11,GEORGE,Come on! Come on!
S07E11,JERRY,"Wait a second! I never baited a hook with a rye before. Your hook is too small. This is for, like, a muffin. All right. Take it away."
S07E11,GEORGE,Come on. Come on. Come on. Yeah. Yeah. (grunting)
S07E11,MANAGER,"Ladies and gentlemen, John Germaine."
S07E12,JERRY,How did you lock your keys in the car?
S07E12,GEORGE,How? Cause Im an Idiot.
S07E12,JERRY,So why don't you get a locksmith?
S07E12,GEORGE,"I was going to, but then I found out that the auto club has this free locksmith service, so I signed up. Just waiting for the membership to kick in."
S07E12,JERRY,How long has your car been sitting in the Yankee parking lot?
S07E12,GEORGE,"I don't know, about three days."
S07E12,KRAMER,Hello boys.
S07E12,JERRY,Y- you're not playin' golf?
S07E12,KRAMER,"Yes, indeed. The calendar says winter, but he gods of spring are out."
S07E12,GEORGE,Are the courses open?
S07E12,KRAMER,"No, no........I'm sneaking in with Stan the Caddy, we've been going through the caddies entrance."
S07E12,GEORGE,"Huh, No kidding?"
S07E12,KRAMER,"Yeah, and I'll tell ya something else. Stan's advice has transformed my game. He's never wrong. Oh, he thinks eventually I'll have a shot at making it big on the senior tour. (sucks in air through tight lips) Oh, that's my dream, Jerry."
S07E12,JERRY,"Really, you're getting that good?"
S07E12,KRAMER,"Oh, I'm the real deal."
S07E12,KRAMER,"Yeah, here, Stan, in here!"
S07E12,KRAMER,"There he is, yeah - Jerry, George, *this* is Stan the Caddy."
S07E12,GEORGE,How ya doin'?
S07E12,JERRY,Hi.
S07E12,STAN,"Nice to meet you. Ready to hit the links, Kramer?"
S07E12,KRAMER,"Oh yeah, you betcha."
S07E12,STAN,"What are those, ah, cotton pants?"
S07E12,KRAMER,"Yeah, Yeah...Why, is it too cold out?"
S07E12,STAN,"Here's what you do you bring a lightweight jacket, that way the sun comes out, you play the jacket off the sweater."
S07E12,KRAMER,"Ah, that makes sense, that's a good call, Stan. Alright, we'll see you guys later, huh?"
S07E12,GEORGE,Yeah.
S07E12,JERRY,"Yeah, we'll see ya."
S07E12,GEORGE & JERRY,(together -- with arms extended -- palms upwards) Stan The Caddy.
S07E12,SUE ELLEN,Elaine?
S07E12,SUE ELLEN,Hi!
S07E12,ELAINE (thinking to herself),"Oh, great. It's the bra-less wonder. Who does she think she's kidding? Look at her, she's totally out of control."
S07E12,SUE ELLEN,I was thinking that woman looks like Elaine Benes.
S07E12,ELAINE,"Yeah, ha ha ha. What have you been up to?"
S07E12,SUE ELLEN,I've just been hanging out.
S07E12,ELAINE (nodding),I see.
S07E12,SUE ELLEN,"Hmm. Oh, listen! I'm having a birthday party tomorrow evening, I'd love it if you came by."
S07E12,ELAINE,Oh Tomorrow...?
S07E12,SUE ELLEN,Um-hm.
S07E12,ELAINE,I don't know if I can.
S07E12,SUE ELLEN,Nooo?
S07E12,ELAINE,"Yeah, I'm just really, really busy."
S07E12,SUE ELLEN,"Oh, that's too bad."
S07E12,ELAINE,"Yeah, yeah."
S07E12,SUE ELLEN,"Well, I hope you can get me a gift anyway.........ha ha ha."
S07E12,ELAINE,Ah Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha.
S07E12,WILHELM,George!?
S07E12,GEORGE,(he drops a paper airplane he was holding) Mr. Wilhelm!
S07E12,WILHELM,"I'm sorry to interrupt you, but Mr. Steinbrenner and I really want you to know we appreciate all the hours you've been putting in Oh, and, ah, confidentially, Sozonkel, our Assistant to the General Manger, hasn't really been working out. And the boss thinks you're the man for the job! So, keep it under your hat!"
S07E12,GEORGE,"Assistant to the General Manager!! Do you know what means?!? He'd could be askin' my advice on trades! Trades, Jerry, I'm a heartbeat away!"
S07E12,JERRY,That's a hell of an organization they're running up there. I can't understand why they haven't won a pennant in 15 years.
S07E12,GEORGE,"And, it is all because of that car"
S07E12,GEORGE,"See, Steinbrenner is like the first guy in, at the crack of dawn. He sees my car, he figures I'm the first guy in"
S07E12,GEORGE,"Then, the last person to leave is Wilhelm. He sees my car, he figures I'm burning the midnight oil. Between the two of them, they think I'm working an 18 hour day! (he stands there with his hands on his hips, a wide grin - laughing.)"
S07E12,JERRY,Locking your keys in your car is the best career move you ever made.
S07E12,ELAINE,Hey.
S07E12,JERRY,Hey.
S07E12,GEORGE,"Hey, how ya doing?!?"
S07E12,ELAINE,"Better, now."
S07E12,JERRY,"Yeah, what happened?"
S07E12,ELAINE,You know Sue Ellen Mishke?
S07E12,JERRY,Sue Ellen Mishke?
S07E12,ELAINE,"Yeah, the woman I grew up with in Maryland, she moved here last year..."
S07E12,JERRY,Sounds familiar.
S07E12,ELAINE,The heiress to the O'Henry candy bar fortune--
S07E12,JERRY,"Oh, yeah, you mentioned her."
S07E12,ELAINE,"Yes. Yes I ran into her today. This woman has never, not once, ever, as long as I have known her, worn a bra."
S07E12,GEORGE,"Ah, that is disgusting--"
S07E12,JERRY,"That is just shameless, I don't know, There's no--"
S07E12,GEORGE,"Shes a pig. The woman's a pig, what wrong with her--"
S07E12,JERRY,"It's wrong, it's rude, and it's incorrect."
S07E12,GEORGE,It's disgusting--
S07E12,ELAINE (getting up to leave),"Alright, there's no---"
S07E12,GEORGE,Come on! Come-on.
S07E12,JERRY,We're only kidding!
S07E12,ELAINE,"You don't understand. See, she hasn't changed at all. She stole my boyfriend when I was in high school. (flashback sequence)I was at this party, and I was dating this *really* cute guy, his name was Tom Cosley, by the way, and she goes walking by, in this little floozy outfit, and he follows her, right out the door!"
S07E12,JERRY (excited),She's your Lex Luthor!
S07E12,ELAINE,"Her birthday's comin' up, see, so I decided to get her a little present."
S07E12,JERRY,What are you going to get her?
S07E12,ELAINE,"A very traditional, a very supportive, brazier."
S07E12,JERRY,There's nothing subtle about that.
S07E12,GEORGE,"No, no, she might just think its a gift."
S07E12,JERRY,Have I ever bought you a jock strap as a gift?
S07E12,GEORGE,"Ahh, Hey-Ho. ahhhhh (exhales)"
S07E12,JERRY,"What the hell are you doing here, aren't you supposed to be at work?!?"
S07E12,GEORGE,"Yeah, well I'm thinking about getting out of town with Susan for a few days....Her parents rebuilt the cabin!"
S07E12,JERRY,"So, you're just taking off from work?"
S07E12,GEORGE,"Yeah well, they won't know. I got the car there."
S07E12,JERRY,"Do you think this is such a good idea, with you being on the verge of this big promotion?"
S07E12,GEORGE,"My presence, in that office, can only hurt my chances."
S07E12,RECEPTIONIST,(on Intercom) Sue Ellen Mishke to see you.
S07E12,ELAINE,"Sue Ellen Mishke? Ah, alright, send her in."
S07E12,SUE ELLEN,Hi Elaine.
S07E12,ELAINE,Hellllloo.
S07E12,SUE ELLEN,"I happened to be in the neighborhood, so I thought I'd stop in, and thank you for your lovely gift."
S07E12,ELAINE,Ohhhhh. You're....welcome.
S07E12,SUE ELLEN,Is anything wrong?
S07E12,ELAINE,"Well, Sue Ellen, it's a, it's not a top, it's a bra."
S07E12,SUE ELLEN,"Oh, I know. Thanks again."
S07E12,GEORGE,"This is the life! Isn't it, huh, kid?"
S07E12,SUSAN,Wanna check out a swap meet?
S07E12,GEORGE,"Yeah, maybe. (snifs)Where'd you get that?"
S07E12,SUSAN,"Oh, it was on the windshield of the car when we came out of that rest stop."
S07E12,JERRY ,Yello.
S07E12,GEORGE,"(on a pay phone) Hey, hey, it's George, I need ya to do me a favor."
S07E12,JERRY,What's goin' on?
S07E12,GEORGE,"I just remembered, th-th-there's this Chinese restaurant out near Yankee Stadium, that puts flyers on all the cars."
S07E12,JERRY,"Yeah, so?"
S07E12,GEORGE,"Alright, this is what ya gotta do I need ya to go out to the parking lot at Yankee Stadium, take the flyers off my car."
S07E12,JERRY,"You know last time you had me throwin' a rye bread up three floors to you, now you want me to go up to the Bronx, take flyers off your car, where does it end?!?"
S07E12,GEORGE,"Alright, fine.I'll drive the 3 hours each way, 6 hours all together, and take 'em off myself!!"
S07E12,JERRY,"Alright, alright, I'll do it!!"
S07E12,KRAMER,Oowe (Kramer noise -- hes eating something)
S07E12,JERRY,"Hey, what are ya up to?"
S07E12,KRAMER,Nothin'.
S07E12,JERRY,You wanna go with me up to (clap) the Bronx and see if there's any flyers on George's car.
S07E12,KRAMER (excited),Sure!
S07E12,JERRY,"I guess I coulda said just about anything there, couldn't I? (throws coat over his right shoulder)"
S07E12,KRAMER,yep.
S07E12,JERRY,"Oh, man, look at this mess! You know what's gonna happen if they see this?"
S07E12,KRAMER,Wheehh
S07E12,JERRY,What are we gonna do?
S07E12,KRAMER,I don't know.
S07E12,JERRY,"Well, we gotta get it washed (pulls off a few flyers)....Ah, the keys are locked inside!"
S07E12,KRAMER,Wait a second....
S07E12,JERRY,What are ya gonna do?
S07E12,KRAMER,I'll just snag the lock with this. auhh Here we go...
S07E12,JERRY,"Yeah, this quite a life I lead here, huh?"
S07E12,[Leaving the Gentle Touch Car Wash,Jerry and Kramer driving George's car. Kramer is behind the wheel.]
S07E12,KRAMER,"Well, George has gotta be happy about this."
S07E12,JERRY (indifferent),"Yeah, yeah, yeah..."
S07E12,JERRY,"Oh my God, Kramer, is that woman just wearing a bra?"
S07E12,KRAMER,"Oh, mama."
S07E12,JERRY,Kramer!!! (Jerry points to the lamp post they are about to crash into)
S07E12,ELAINE,"My God, are you okay?"
S07E12,KRAMER,Well I got a cut on my head and I banged my shoulder. (He has a large Band-aid on his forehead)
S07E12,JERRY,"I guess I have to bring his car back up to the stadium, if it can make it."
S07E12,ELAINE,So how did this happen?
S07E12,JERRY,He was starin' at some woman!
S07E12,KRAMER,"Well I couldn't help it, you saw what she was wearing."
S07E12,ELAINE,What woman?
S07E12,JERRY,There was this beautiful woman walking down the street wearing *just* a bra. I can't get that image out of my mind.
S07E12,ELAINE,Oh...my God.
S07E12,JERRY,What?
S07E12,ELAINE,"Was it a tall woman, in a black blazer?"
S07E12,JERRY,Yeah!
S07E12,ELAINE,Ohhh! That's Sue Ellen Mishke!
S07E12,JERRY,Sue Ellen Mishke?
S07E12,ELAINE,"That's the bra I gave here, she's wearing it as a top! The woman is walking around in broad daylight with nothing but a bra on, she's a menace to society."
S07E12,KRAMER,"Hey you know, my arm really hurts. I wonder if its gonna affect my golf swing."
S07E12,KRAMER,Oohh.
S07E12,STAN (out of breath),"I got your message, how's the shoulder?"
S07E12,KRAMER,"Yeah, it's my left arm, I can't swing it!"
S07E12,STAN,"Oh, no.Not the left arm!"
S07E12,KRAMER,"Well what happens if I can't play like I was? What about the tour, and all my dreams?"
S07E12,ELAINE,Oh! I got it! Let's sue her!
S07E12,KRAMER,Sue her?
S07E12,ELAINE,"Yeah, she's loaded. She's the heiress to the O'Henry candy bar fortune."
S07E12,KRAMER,"Ah, No, no, no, I can't. I learned my lesson from that coffee company."
S07E12,ELAINE,"Kramer, listen to me. Listen! This is a once in a lifetime opportunity. Your dreams have been shattered, somebody's got to be held accountable. Come on, we'll take for every penny she's got!"
S07E12,KRAMER,"What do you think, Stan?"
S07E12,STAN,Let's go for the green! You know a good lawyer?
S07E12,JACKIE,"So you're driving in the car, you're with your friend, minding your own business?"
S07E12,KRAMER,Yeah.
S07E12,JACKIE,Then what happened?
S07E12,KRAMER,"Well then we saw this woman, and she was wearing a bra with no top."
S07E12,JACKIE,No top? She didn't have a top on?
S07E12,KRAMER,Yeah.So I got distracted and I crashed the car.
S07E12,JACKIE,Well how would you describe this woman? Would you say she was an attractive woman?
S07E12,KRAMER,"Oh, yeah."
S07E12,JACKIE,"So we got an attractive woman, wearing a bra, no top, walkin' around in broad daylight. She's flouting society's conventions!"
S07E12,KRAMER,She was flouting.
S07E12,JACKIE,"That's totally inappropriate. It's lewd, lascivious, salacious, outrageous!"
S07E12,KRAMER,It was outrageous. And she's the heir to the O'Henry candy bar fortune.
S07E12,JACKIE,Could you repeat that?
S07E12,KRAMER,I said she's the heir to the O'Henry candy bar fortune.
S07E12,JACKIE,"O'Henry? That's one of our top-selling candy bars. It's got chocolate, peanuts, nougat, it's delicious, scrumptious, outstanding! Have you been to a doctor?"
S07E12,KRAMER,No.
S07E12,JACKIE (speaking to the intercom),"Susie, call Dr. Bison, set up an appointment for Mr. Kramer, tell him it's for me."
S07E12,KRAMER,"So whadda ya think, Jackie? I mean we got a case?"
S07E12,JACKIE,Like taking candy from a baby.
S07E12,GEORGE,"I think I got it. How 'bout this? How 'bout this? We trade Jim Leyritz and Bernie Williams, for Barry Bonds, huh? Whadda ya think? That way I have Griffey and Bonds, in the same outfield! Now you got a team! Ha ha ha."
S07E12,SUSAN,"I don't know, George. I'm still worried about this car thing."
S07E12,GEORGE,"Oh, would ya stop worrying?"
S07E12,SUSAN,"Well, what about the flyers?"
S07E12,GEORGE,"Jerry took the flyers off the car, I got the whole thing covered."
S07E12,STEINBRENNER,Come in!
S07E12,STEINBRENNER,"Ah, Wilhelm."
S07E12,WILHELM,"Mr. Steinbrenner, I am very concerned about George Costanza."
S07E12,STEINBRENNER,How 'bout a 'good morning'?
S07E12,WILHELM,"Oh yes sir, good morning, good morning, sir."
S07E12,STEINBRENNER,"Good morning to you, Wilhelm."
S07E12,WILHELM,"Uh-a Anyway, his car's in the parking lot, the front end is bashed in, and there's blood in the car, and we can't find him anywhere. Obviously he was in some sort of a terrible car accident, and trooper that he is, he tried to make it into work, sir."
S07E12,STEINBRENNER,"Alright, Wilhelm, listen to me. I want the stadium scoured. He could be bleeding to death in the bullpen."
S07E12,WILHELM,Yes sir. (he starts backing up to the door.)
S07E12,STEINBRENNER,"Put everyone on alert, check all the area hospitals, clinics, shelters, we've gotta find that kid."
S07E12,WILHELM,"Yes sir, yes sir. (Opening the door)"
S07E12,STEINBRENNER,We must find George.
S07E12,WILHELM,Yes sir.
S07E12,STEINBRENNER,"Find him, Wilhelm!"
S07E12,WILHELM,(from behind the closed door in the hallway)Yes sir.
S07E12,SUE ELLEN,"Excuse me, do you happen to know the gentleman across the hall?"
S07E12,JERRY (mesmerized),"Yes, yes, I do."
S07E12,SUE ELLEN,Do you happen to know if he'll be back anytime soon?
S07E12,JERRY,"No, I don't."
S07E12,SUE ELLEN,Oh...
S07E12,JERRY,"Is there, something I can help you with?"
S07E12,SUE ELLEN,"No, I really just needed to speak with him. (exhales)"
S07E12,JERRY,"Well, you can wait for him in here if you like."
S07E12,SUE ELLEN,"Oh, well maybe I will."
S07E12,SUE ELLEN,If you don't mind.
S07E12,JERRY,"No, no, not at all."
S07E12,SUE ELLEN,Thanks.
S07E12,JERRY,I'm Jerry Seinfeld.
S07E12,STEINBRENNER,"What is with these people, all day long. Come in, come in."
S07E12,WILHELM,"Ah, Mr. Steinbrenner, you know, w-we've searched everywhere, th-there's no sign of him. n-n-Not even anyone who remotely fits his description, sir."
S07E12,STEINBRENNER,"Oh my God. Do you know what this means, Wilhelm?"
S07E12,WILHELM,"What, sir?"
S07E12,STEINBRENNER,He's dead! ca-Costanza's dead!
S07E12,WILHELM,"No no no sir. Well, you see, I don't think--"
S07E12,STEINBRENNER,"Oh, as quickly as he came here, he's gone. The poor little guy! Easy. Easy, big Stein, get it together. Ok, Wilhelm."
S07E12,WILHELM,Yessir?
S07E12,STEINBRENNER,Find out where his parents live.
S07E12,WILHELM,Parents.
S07E12,STEINBRENNER,"I'm gonna personally notify them. ...and, ah, line up some candidates to fill that assistant to the General Manager position"
S07E12,WILHELM,Yessir. (he starts backing up to the door.)
S07E12,STEINBRENNER,we can't grieve forever!
S07E12,WILHELM,Right. Yessir.
S07E12,STEINBRENNER,We gotta get back to business!
S07E12,WILHELM,Yes Sir! (closes the door)
S07E12,STEINBRENNER,Back to Business Wilhelm!
S07E12,WILHELM,(from behind the closed door in the hallway) Yes Sir!
S07E12,KRAMER,"Well, buddy, (claps) he's taking the case! Jackie Chiles is right on it! Right on it, he's all over it!"
S07E12,JERRY (not happy),"Oh, really?"
S07E12,KRAMER,"Why, wh-wh-what's wrong, come on?"
S07E12,JERRY,I don't know
S07E12,KRAMER,uuh-
S07E12,JERRY,so the woman was walking around in a bra
S07E12,KRAMER,Yeah-
S07E12,JERRY,I mean it's no big deal. You're still drivin'. You should have been watching the road.
S07E12,KRAMER,"Well, your attitude has certainly changed."
S07E12,JERRY,I don't think my attitude has changed.
S07E12,KRAMER,"Now listen, Jerry, I'm gonna need you to testify."
S07E12,JERRY,"(quietly, yet in a high and whiney tone) Well, I don't know if I...."
S07E12,KRAMER,"Jerry, Jerry, you gotta testify!"
S07E12,JERRY,Kramer I don't think I can--
S07E12,KRAMER,"Listen, this is a million dollars we're talkin' about, Jerry, now this is the big league, the big time, now I need you on my team, Jerry!"
S07E12,JERRY,"Well, I'm just not sure how I feel about it, Kramer."
S07E12,KRAMER,"Alright what's gotten into you, what's happened?!?"
S07E12,JERRY,Nothing's happened.
S07E12,KRAMER (in disgust),Goohhhhck.
S07E12,KRAMER (picking up the wrapper),"Ohhhh, what's this?"
S07E12,JERRY,"Oh, no, no, no, wait a second, wait a second th-th-that--"
S07E12,KRAMER,"Oh I see....Yessss. Little Miss Candy Bar paid a visit, didn't she?"
S07E12,JERRY,"Kramer, it is not what you think."
S07E12,KRAMER,"Ah, Ah, Ahhhhh! I know what I think. I think you're gaga over this dame. She's twisted you around her little finger, and now, you're willing to sell me, and Elaine, and whoever else you have to, right down the river."
S07E12,JERRY,"And what about yooou?!? Tryin' to bilk an innocent bystander out of a family fortune, built on sweat and toil, manufacturing quality O'Henry candy bars, for honest, hard-working Americans!"
S07E12,KRAMER,You're just out for sex!!
S07E12,JERRY,You're just out for money!!
S07E12,KRAMER and JERRY (together),"Ah, Ah, Ahhhhh!!!!!!"
S07E12,STEINBRENNER,Mrs. Costanza?
S07E12,ESTELLE (smiling),Yesss?
S07E12,STEINBRENNER,"My name is George Steinbrenner, I'm afraid I have some very sad new about your son."
S07E12,ESTELLE,(gasps)
S07E12,ESTELLE (crying),"I can't believe it, he was so young. How could this have happened?"
S07E12,STEINBRENNER,"Well, he'd been logging some pretty heavy hours, first one in in the morning, last one to leave at night. That kid was a human dynamo."
S07E12,ESTELLE,Are you sure you're talking about George?
S07E12,STEINBRENNER,You are Mr. and Mrs. Costanza?
S07E12,FRANK (yelling),"What the hell did you trade Jay Buener for?!? He had 30 home runs, and over 100 RBIs last year. He's got a rocket for an arm - - you don't know what the hell you're doin'!!"
S07E12,STEINBRENNER,"Well, Buhner was a good prospect, no question about it. But my baseball people love Ken Phelps' bat. They kept saying 'Ken Phelps, Ken Phelps'."
S07E12,JERRYS OUTGOING MESSAGE,"Im not here, leave a message."
S07E12,FRANK (from the answering machine),"Jerry, it's Frank Costanza, Mr. Steinbrenners here, George is dead, call me back!"
S07E12,JERRY (answering phone),Hello?
S07E12,GEORGE (on a pay phone),"Hey, it's George."
S07E12,JERRY,Where have you been?!?
S07E12,GEORGE,What?
S07E12,JERRY,"I just got the most bizarre message from you father, Steinbrenner is at you house, they think you're dead!"
S07E12,GEORGE,Dead?
S07E12,JERRY,"Yeah, and we had an accident with your car, it's a, its a little crumpled."
S07E12,GEORGE,My cars a little crumpled?!?
S07E12,JERRY,"Yeah, yeah, I didn't know what to do so I put it back at the stadium. Oh, wait a second, wait a second, they saw the car, they saw the blood, they couldn't find ya, that's why Steinbrenner thinks you're dead!"
S07E12,GEORGE,"Allright, I gotta head back right away, I'll-Ill -- I gotta figure something out here."
S07E12,JERRY,Well you gotta call your parents.
S07E12,GEORGE,"I can't, Steinbrenner might still be there!"
S07E12,JERRY,Aren't you gonna tell your parents you're still alive?
S07E12,GEORGE,OOuuoo! They could use the break!
S07E12,PETERMAN (holding up a bra),"Elaine, do you see this? Do you see what I'm holding in my hands?"
S07E12,ELAINE,"Yeah, it's a bra."
S07E12,PETERMAN,"I saw a woman in our hallway wearing one of these as a top. (sits on the corner of the desk)What exquisite beauty, I ran down the hallway to talk to her, but the elevator door closed. It was not to be.Perhaps our paths will cross again some day."
S07E12,ELAINE,w-What is this all about?
S07E12,PETERMAN,I wanna market this item as a new direction in women's fashion.
S07E12,ELAINE,"Oh-oh, but-"
S07E12,PETERMAN,"We're gonna sell this as a top. Here's the angle Zelda Fitzgerald, aaaand, somebody in the 20s, wearing this at wild parties, driving all the men crazy (tosses the bra on Elaines desk) Have it on my desk by the end of the week."
S07E12,STEINBRENNER,"Come in, come in."
S07E12,GEORGE,Mr. Steinbrenner--
S07E12,STEINBRENNER (shocked),"Ahhh, Ahhh! Ah, ah ah! Is it you?"
S07E12,GEORGE,"Yeah, it's me sir. It's been a harrowing few days. uuh,After the car accident, I-I crawled into a ditch, and managed to survive on, grubs and puddle water, until a kindly old gentleman picked me up."
S07E12,STEINBRENNER,"Grubs, huh? Gotta admit, I never tasted one of those."
S07E12,GEORGE,"Anyway, as I was lying in the puddle, I-I think I may have found a way for us to get Bonds and Griffey, and we wouldn't have to give up that much."
S07E12,STEINBRENNER,"Well, don't tell it to me George, tell it to the new Assistant to the General Manager."
S07E12,GEORGE,I didn't get the job?
S07E12,STEINBRENNER,"Well, once you were dead, we couldn't just sit on our hands. We had to make a move..."
S07E12,STEINBRENNER,"But, you still have your old job. Of course, we'll have to dock you for the time you missed. We're running a ball club here. If I give special treatment to you, everyone will want it. Next thing you know its chaos! And I can tell you this, (George closes the door) chaos does not work for the New York Yankees! Not as long as I'm running the show!"
S07E12,JACKIE,"So it was the meeting on the street that prompted you to buy the bra for Miss Mishke, would you say that was correct?"
S07E12,ELAINE (on the witness stand),"Yes...ummm, (leans into the microphone, pulling it closer it squeaks) yes, that's correct."
S07E12,JACKIE,"And you have also brought with you, another bra, (goes over to the table and pulls a bra out of a bag) exactly like, the one that she so flagrantly exhibited herself in!"
S07E12,ELAINE,"Yes, that's correct."
S07E12,JACKIE,"Uh, what was you golf score, the last round you played uh, before you shoulder was injured?"
S07E12,KRAMER,Three under par.
S07E12,JACKIE (impressed),"Oooohhhh, three under par, HmmThat's what the professionals shoot, isn't it?"
S07E12,KRAMER,Well if they're lucky.
S07E12,JACKIE,Well would you tell this jury exactly what you saw at the corner of 83rd Street and Columbus?
S07E12,JERRY (hesitant),I...don't remember.
S07E12,JACKIE,"Well, did you, or did you not, see the defendant, wearing the bra?"
S07E12,JERRY,I don't know. Maybe.
S07E12,JACKIE,"Mr. Seinfeld, I might remind you that you are under oath. Now I ask you again, did you or did you not, see this woman wearing a bra?!?"
S07E12,JERRY,"....Alright, alright, I saw her!"
S07E12,JERRY,"And she was beautiful in that bra! I'm crazy about her! I love her whole free swinging, free wheeling attitude!"
S07E12,JUDGE (banging his gavel),This court will come to order!
S07E12,JACKIE,"No further questions, your honor."
S07E12,JUDGE,You may step down.
S07E12,JACKIE,"Well Kramer, I think we got this wrapped up."
S07E12,KRAMER,"Yeah, yeah...What's your read, Stan?"
S07E12,STAN,"You're close, you're on the green. You just have to go for the cup."
S07E12,KRAMER,What do you mean?
S07E12,STAN,"Have her try on the bra, see if it fits."
S07E12,JACKIE,"No, no, no, no!"
S07E12,KRAMER,"Do it, Jackie. Stan's the man."
S07E12,JACKIE,Stan? Who the hell is Stan?
S07E12,KRAMER,He's my caddy.
S07E12,JACKIE,You're caddy?!? This is a big mistake!
S07E12,KRAMER,Gu-gu- cada-
S07E12,JACKIE,"Your honor, we request at this time, that Miss Mishke...try on the bra."
S07E12,JUDGE,"(bangs the gavel twice)This court will come to order! Go ahead Miss Mishke, try it on."
S07E12,SUE ELLEN,"Uhhh-Ah, it doesn't fit...I, I-I can't put it on."
S07E12,JACKIE (to Kramer and Stan),"Damn fools! Look at that! We got nothin' now, nothin'! I've been practicing law for 25 years, you're listenin' to a caddy!"
S07E12,KRAMER,"OK, OK-"
S07E12,JACKIE ,"This is a public humiliation! You can't let the defendant, have control of the key piece of evidence. Plus, she's trying it on over a leotard, of course a bra's not gonna fit on over a leotard. A bras gotta fit right up against a person's skin, like a glove!"
S07E12,WOMAN #1,"Oh, hey, Elaine, how 'bout some lunch?"
S07E12,ELAINE,"Oh, no, I-I don't think so."
S07E12,WOMAN #2,Great job on the Gatzby Swing Top. It's a winner.
S07E12,ELAINE,"Yeah, yeah, thanks."
S07E12,WOMAN #1,Are you sure you don't wanna go? We have reservations.
S07E12,ELAINE,"Oh, I don't think you'll have any trouble gettin' a table."
S07E12,WOMAN #1,Ciao.
S07E12,WOMAN #2,Ba-bye.
S07E13,ELAINE,"(awed) Oh, look at this!"
S07E13,JERRY,"Boy, I miss the days they made toys that could kill a kid."
S07E13,ELAINE,"(excited) Oh, cool! Look at that!"
S07E13,JERRY,"(admiring Christie) Yeah, I'm right there with ya."
S07E13,ELAINE,"(excited) That is a Schwinn Stingray! And it's the girl's model! Oh, I always wanted one of these when I was little."
S07E13,ELAINE,What d'you think Jerry? Jerry?
S07E13,JERRY,(tearing himself away from Christie) Huh?
S07E13,ELAINE,What d'you think?
S07E13,JERRY,"Oh yeah, be great for your paper route."
S07E13,ELAINE,(laughs) I love it. I'm getting it.
S07E13,ELAINE,"Can you help me get it down, Jer? Jerry."
S07E13,CHRISTIE,I think your friend needs some help over there.
S07E13,JERRY,"You know, the only way to really help her is to just let her be."
S07E13,ELAINE,Hey!
S07E13,SUSAN,A little baby girl?
S07E13,KEN,Doctor says it could be any day now.
S07E13,GEORGE,"(through mouthful of food) So, Carrie, you and Susan are cousins. So your baby daughter is gonna be Susan's second cousin, right? So what does that make me?"
S07E13,CARRIE,Doesn't make you anything.
S07E13,GEORGE,"(jokingly) Well, so, legally, I could marry your daughter."
S07E13,SUSAN,"So, have you picked out a name yet?"
S07E13,CARRIE,"Well, we've narrowed it down to a few. We like Kimberley."
S07E13,SUSAN,Aww.
S07E13,GEORGE,"(negative) Hu-ho, boy."
S07E13,KEN,You don't like Kimberley?
S07E13,GEORGE,Ech. What else you got?
S07E13,KEN,How about Joan?
S07E13,GEORGE,"Aw c'mon, I'm eating here."
S07E13,SUSAN,(warning) George!
S07E13,CARRIE,Pamela?
S07E13,GEORGE,"Pamela?! Awright, I tell you what. You look like nice people, I'm gonna help you out. You want a beautiful name? Soda."
S07E13,KEN,What?
S07E13,GEORGE,Soda. S-O-D-A. Soda.
S07E13,CARRIE,"I don't know, it sounds a little strange."
S07E13,GEORGE,"All names sound strange the first time you hear 'em. What, you telling me people loved the name Blanche the first time they heard it?"
S07E13,KEN,"Yeah, but uh... Soda?"
S07E13,GEORGE,"Yeah, that's right. It's working."
S07E13,CARRIE,We'll put it on the list.
S07E13,GEORGE,I solve problems. That's just what I do.
S07E13,KRAMER,"(sniffing a slice of meat) Yeah, oh boy. Mmm, that's good."
S07E13,JERRY,You're really going to town with that turkey there.
S07E13,KRAMER,"Oh yeah, I got a big appetite."
S07E13,KRAMER,"Uhh, Jerry, you got no mustard, huh."
S07E13,JERRY,It's on the door.
S07E13,KRAMER,"(examining a yellow squeeze bottle) What, this yellow stuff? No, I said mustard, Jerry. Dijon."
S07E13,KRAMER,"Ah, 's no good."
S07E13,KRAMER,No. That's bush league.
S07E13,JERRY,"Hey, hey. Wha... wait... what, you're gonna leave it there? That's like half a pound of turkey!"
S07E13,KRAMER,"No, no, I can't eat that. You can't eat a sandwich without Dijon."
S07E13,JERRY,"(sarcasm) Yeah, you're right. I really should keep more of your favourites on hand."
S07E13,KRAMER,"Hey, hey, hey. I'm getting a vibe here. What, are you unhappy with our arrangement?"
S07E13,JERRY,What arrangement?
S07E13,KRAMER,"Well, I was under the impression that I could take anything I wanted from your fridge, and you could take whatever you want from mine."
S07E13,JERRY,"(sarcasm) Yeah, well, lemme know when you get something in there and I will."
S07E13,KRAMER,"Oh, hey."
S07E13,ELAINE,Hey.
S07E13,JERRY,Hey. What's with your neck?
S07E13,ELAINE,Still killing me from having to get that bike off the wall. (pointedly) By myself.
S07E13,JERRY,"Well, if it's any consolation, I did get her number."
S07E13,ELAINE,"(sitting) Ah, I think I really strained it. Ow."
S07E13,JERRY,"Aw, I doubt you strained it. Maybe you pulled it."
S07E13,ELAINE,"Ach, maybe."
S07E13,JERRY,Did you twist it? You coulda twisted it.
S07E13,ELAINE,I don't know.
S07E13,JERRY,Did you wrench it? Did you jam it? Maybe you squeezed it. Turned it...
S07E13,<IMG SRC=http,//tinyurl.com/2b9c width=200 >
S07E13,ELAINE,"(patience exhausted) You know what, why don't you just shut the hell up?"
S07E13,JERRY,Awright.
S07E13,ELAINE,"God. Man, this is killing me. Right now, I would give that bike to the first person who could make this pain go away."
S07E13,KRAMER,"Aw, you really hurting, huh?"
S07E13,ELAINE,"Oh, Kramer, it's just awful."
S07E13,KRAMER,"Uh hmm. Well, your arterioles have constricted."
S07E13,KRAMER,"Alright, lean forward, relax."
S07E13,ELAINE,(worried) What? What?
S07E13,KRAMER,Encounter shiatsu.
S07E13,ELAINE,"Wait a minute. Kramer, you know what you're doing here?"
S07E13,KRAMER,(continuing to work) Ohh yeah. A wise man once taught me the Healing power of the body's natural pressure points.
S07E13,ELAINE,Ah hah.
S07E13,KRAMER,(to Jerry) He sells tee-shirts outside the World Trade Centre.
S07E13,ELAINE,(seriously worried) Wha...?
S07E13,KRAMER,He's a genius. Here we go...
S07E13,KRAMER,"From pain, will come pleasure."
S07E13,KRAMER,Uh? Voila.
S07E13,ELAINE,(pleasantly surprised) Oh my god!
S07E13,KRAMER,Yeah.
S07E13,ELAINE,Wow! That is unbelievable. The pain is totally gone!
S07E13,JERRY,What's even more amazing is his formal training is in pediatrics.
S07E13,KRAMER,"Awright, my work is done here."
S07E13,ELAINE,"(big smile) Oh man! Kramer, thank you!"
S07E13,KRAMER,"(closing the door) Yeah, you can send that bike over any time."
S07E13,ELAINE,"(after Kramer) What? (to Jerry) What, what is he talking about?"
S07E13,JERRY,"I dunno. (realising) Oh, 'cos you said you'd give the bike to anyone who fixes your neck."
S07E13,ELAINE,You really think he wants the bike?
S07E13,JERRY,Oh yeah.
S07E13,ELAINE,It took him like ten seconds!
S07E13,JERRY,"Well, that's the most he's worked in the last four months."
S07E13,GEORGE,I think they really went for that Soda.
S07E13,SUSAN,"What, are you crazy? They hated it. They were just humouring you."
S07E13,GEORGE,"Ah, alright. Believe me, that kid's gonna be called Soda."
S07E13,SUSAN,"I can tell you, I would never name my child Soda."
S07E13,GEORGE,"Oh, no no no. Course not. I got a great name for our kids. A real original. You wanna hear what it is? Huh, you ready?"
S07E13,SUSAN,Yeah.
S07E13,SUSAN,What is that? Sign language?
S07E13,GEORGE,"No, Seven."
S07E13,SUSAN,Seven Costanza? You're serious?
S07E13,GEORGE,Yeah. It's a beautiful name for a boy or a girl...
S07E13,GEORGE,...especially a girl. Or a boy.
S07E13,SUSAN,I don't think so.
S07E13,GEORGE,"What, you don't like the name?"
S07E13,SUSAN,It's not a name. It's a number.
S07E13,GEORGE,"I know. It's Mickey Mantle's number. So not only is it an all around beautiful name, it is also a living tribute."
S07E13,SUSAN,It's awful. I hate it!
S07E13,GEORGE,"(angry) Well, that's the name!"
S07E13,SUSAN,(also angry) Oh no it is not! No child of mine is ever going to be named Seven!
S07E13,GEORGE,"(yelling) Awright, let's just stay calm here! Don't get all crazy on me!"
S07E13,JERRY,"Seven? Yeah, I guess I could see it. Seven. Seven periods of school, seven beatings a day. Roughly seven stitches a beating, and eventually seven years to life. Yeah, you're doing that child quite a service."
S07E13,GEORGE,(adamant) Yes I am. I defy you to come up with a better name than Seven.
S07E13,JERRY,"Awright, let's see. How about Mug? (picks up the mug) Mug Costanza, that's original. (he turns and sees another item) Or uh, Ketchup? Pretty name for a girl."
S07E13,GEORGE,"Alright, you having a good time there?"
S07E13,JERRY,I got fifty right here in the cupboard. How about Bisquik? Pimento. Gherkin. Sauce. Maxwell House.
S07E13,GEORGE,"(shouts) Awright already!! This is a very key issue with me, Jerry. I had this name for a long time."
S07E13,JERRY,"Oh, I forgot to call Christie."
S07E13,GEORGE,Christie? That's the one you met in the antique store?
S07E13,JERRY,"Yeah, she had this great black and white dress, with a scoop neck. She looked like some kinda superhero."
S07E13,GEORGE,And you met her in an antique store! I don't know how you do it!
S07E13,JERRY,(smug) I'm not engaged.
S07E13,KRAMER,"Ah, I got it."
S07E13,JERRY,Got what?
S07E13,KRAMER,"(putting the items on the counter) Got the answer, Jerry. Refrigerator problem, is solved."
S07E13,JERRY,"Oh, it's no problem. You can take whatever you want."
S07E13,KRAMER,"Oh, I will. But now, I'm accountable. Alright, I take what I want."
S07E13,KRAMER,"Here. I write it down. (he writes) ""One cupcake."" And then I put it in the bowl. (he tears off the sheet, crumples it and drops it into the bowl) There. Very simple."
S07E13,JERRY,Sort of a mooching inventory.
S07E13,KRAMER,"No, no. Not mooching. 'Cos at the end of the week, you add 'em all up, and you give me the bill."
S07E13,JERRY,Alright.
S07E13,KRAMER,"Alright, now look I gotta run some errands, so look. When Elaine comes by with that bike, you hang onto it for me, alright?"
S07E13,JERRY,"Kramer, I don't know if you're getting that bike."
S07E13,KRAMER,"Yes I am. We had a verbal contract. If we can't take each other at our word, all is lost."
S07E13,KRAMER,"(waving at the bowl) Oh yeah, yeah. Put that on my tab."
S07E13,JERRY,"Well this is it. The food is atrocious, but the busboys are the best in the city."
S07E13,MAITRE D',"May I take your coat, miss?"
S07E13,CHRISTIE,"Yes, thank you."
S07E13,GEORGE,The same outfit?
S07E13,JERRY,The exact same outfit.
S07E13,GEORGE,How many days was it between encounters.
S07E13,JERRY,Three.
S07E13,GEORGE,"Three days. Well, maybe you caught her on the cusp of a new wash cycle. You know, she did laundry the day after she met you, everything got clean and she started all over again."
S07E13,JERRY,"Possibly, but then shouldn't the outfit only reappear again at the end of the cycle?"
S07E13,GEORGE,Maybe she moved it up in the rotation.
S07E13,JERRY,"Why? It's our first date, she's already in reruns?"
S07E13,GEORGE,Very curious.
S07E13,JERRY,Indeed.
S07E13,GEORGE,"You know, Einstein wore the exact same outfit every day."
S07E13,JERRY,"Well, if she splits the atom, I'll let it slide."
S07E13,GEORGE,"(picking up his coat) Awright, I'm heading home."
S07E13,JERRY,"Hey, did Susan change her mind about the name?"
S07E13,GEORGE,"(standing) Not yet, but she's weakening."
S07E13,JERRY,"You know, George, just because your life is destroyed, don't destroy someone else's."
S07E13,GEORGE,"It's Mickey Mantle, Jerry. My idol."
S07E13,JERRY,How about 'Mickey'?
S07E13,GEORGE,'Mickey'? (incredulous) 'Mickey'!
S07E13,KRAMER,Hey buddy.
S07E13,JERRY,"(holding up a can) Hey, is this your half a can of soda in the fridge?"
S07E13,KRAMER,"No, that's yours. My half is gone."
S07E13,JERRY,What?
S07E13,KRAMER,"Yeah, I put my half a can here on the tab. Why, what's your beef?"
S07E13,JERRY,You cannot buy half a can of soda.
S07E13,KRAMER,"Well, why not."
S07E13,JERRY,"Well, I don't wanna get into the whole physics of carbonation with you here, but you know the sound a can makes when you open it?"
S07E13,KRAMER,Yeah.
S07E13,JERRY,"That is the sound of you buying a whole can. And the same goes for this, okay..."
S07E13,JERRY,"...When you pierce the skin of a piece of fruit, you've bought the whole fruit. Not a third of an apple, not a half of a banana..."
S07E13,KRAMER,Alright.
S07E13,JERRY,"...You bite it, you bought it."
S07E13,KRAMER,"Alright, alright. I'll make the necessary adjustments, alright."
S07E13,JERRY,Thank you.
S07E13,KRAMER,Yeah.
S07E13,ELAINE,Hey.
S07E13,KRAMER,"Oh. (pointedly) So, how's the neck? Nice and loose?"
S07E13,ELAINE,"Lookit, Kramer, you are not getting this bike. I don't even know why you ant it. (laughingly) I mean, it's a girl's bike."
S07E13,KRAMER,(deadly serious) It's a verbal contract. We had a deal.
S07E13,ELAINE,"No we didn't. You take these things too literally. It's like saying, you're hungry enough to eat a horse."
S07E13,KRAMER,"Well, my friend Jay Reimenschneider eats horse all the time. He gets it from his butcher."
S07E13,ELAINE,"This is not the point. (emphatic) The point is, you just can't have the bike."
S07E13,KRAMER,"Boy, I am really surprised at you. (opening the door) You are the last person I figured would do something like this. I mean, George, yeah, I can see that. Even Jerry. But not you, Elaine..."
S07E13,KRAMER,I always put you up here...
S07E13,KRAMER,...They're over here. Now you're... aww-whawww.
S07E13,ELAINE,(grudging) Alright.
S07E13,KRAMER,(points) Digidi.
S07E13,GEORGE,"Aw c'mon. It's a fantastic name. It's a real original, nobody else is gonna have it and I absolutely love it."
S07E13,SUSAN,"Well, I dunno how original it's gonna be any more."
S07E13,GEORGE,Why not?
S07E13,SUSAN,"Well I was telling Carrie about our argument, and when I told them the name, they just loved it."
S07E13,GEORGE,"So, what're you saying?"
S07E13,SUSAN,They're gonna name their baby Seven.
S07E13,GEORGE,"(disbelief) What?! They're stealing the name?! That's my name, I made it up!"
S07E13,SUSAN,I can't believe that they're using it.
S07E13,GEORGE,(anger) Well now it's not gonna be original! It's gonna lose all its cachet!
S07E13,SUSAN,I dunno how much cachet it had to begin with.
S07E13,GEORGE,"(rage) Oh, it's got cachet, baby! It's got cachet up the yin-yang!"
S07E13,ELAINE,"(in pain) Oh god! Oh, god. (bitter) Kramer!"
S07E13,MAN,Watch your step.
S07E13,ELAINE,"(pain) Oh, ah. (bitter) Stupid Kramer."
S07E13,CHRISTIE,Excuse me. Elaine?
S07E13,ELAINE,Huh?
S07E13,CHRISTIE,"Over here. I thought that was you. You're Jerry's friend, right?"
S07E13,ELAINE,"Yeah, yeah. Uh, Christie?"
S07E13,CHRISTIE,Yes. How y'doing?
S07E13,ELAINE,(bearing up) I'm fine.
S07E13,CHRISTIE,"Well, I gotta run. It was good to see you."
S07E13,ELAINE,"(after Christie) Okay, oh, it was good to, good to see you."
S07E13,VOICE 1 (O.C.),Lookin' good.
S07E13,VOICE 2 (O.C.),"Hey Cosmo, nice wheels."
S07E13,KRAMER,You got that right!
S07E13,KID,"(scorn) Hey, you're riding a girl's bike."
S07E13,ELAINE,(shouting) Kramer! Kramer!
S07E13,KEN (O.C.),Hello.
S07E13,GEORGE,"Hello, Ken. It's George Costanza. I think we need to talk."
S07E13,ELAINE (O.C.),(angry shout) Kramer!
S07E13,ELAINE,Kramer!!
S07E13,JERRY,Hey
S07E13,ELAINE,Ow! God! Is Kramer back from his little joyride yet?
S07E13,JERRY,Haven't seen him. How's the neck?
S07E13,ELAINE,His chiropractic job was a crock. It's even worse than it was before.
S07E13,JERRY,"Boy, I'm surprised. (sarcasm) I would think Kramer would have a knack for moving pieces of a person's spine around."
S07E13,ELAINE,"Hey, you know what, I think I ran into that girl from the antique store. What's her name, Christie?"
S07E13,JERRY,You saw her? What was she wearing?
S07E13,ELAINE,I don't know. I couldn't see. I couldn't look down because of my neck.
S07E13,JERRY,Didn't you get a glimpse? An impression?
S07E13,ELAINE,What d'you care?
S07E13,JERRY,Both times I've seen her she's worn the same dress.
S07E13,ELAINE,Did you have a nice ride?
S07E13,KRAMER,"Oh, great ride."
S07E13,ELAINE,"Oh, that's good. 'Cos it was your last!"
S07E13,KRAMER,What're you talking about?! We had a deal!
S07E13,ELAINE,(anger) You better give me back that bike! (indicating neck) Look at this! Look! Ow. I couldn't even crawl out of bed this morning.
S07E13,KRAMER,Bed? You should be sleeping on a wooden board for at least a week.
S07E13,ELAINE,What? You never told me that.
S07E13,KRAMER,"Well, it's common sense."
S07E13,ELAINE,"Jerry, what is he talking about? He's being ridiculous."
S07E13,KRAMER,"Alright, look. Jerry, you know the whole story, you should settle this."
S07E13,ELAINE,Yeah Jerry.
S07E13,JERRY,"Well, I'm flattered that you would both appeal to my wisdom, but unfortunately, my friendship to each of you precludes my getting involved. What you need is an impartial mediator."
S07E13,ELAINE,"Yeah, I'd go for that. Would you go for that?"
S07E13,KRAMER,"Alright, I'm down."
S07E13,JERRY,"Course, it would have to be someone who hasn't heard the story before. Someone who is unencumbered by any emotional attachment. Someone whose heart is so dark, it cannot be swayed by pity, compassion, or human emotion of any kind."
S07E13,ELAINE,"So, that's the situation."
S07E13,NEWMAN,"Mmm. You present an interesting dilemma. Each of you seemingly has a legitimate claim to the bicycle, and yet the bicycle can have only one rightful owner. Quite the conundrum. As a federal employee, I believe the law is all we have. (getting worked up) It's all that separates us from the savages who don't deserve even the privilege of the daily mail. (angry) Stuffing parcels into mailboxes where they don't belong!!..."
S07E13,KRAMER,Newman!
S07E13,NEWMAN,"...But, you must promise That you will abide by my decision, no matter how unjust it may seem to either of you. Do I have your word?"
S07E13,KRAMER,"Uh, yeah."
S07E13,ELAINE,Yeah.
S07E13,NEWMAN,"Alright, let's begin."
S07E13,NEWMAN,"(excited) Ooh, my cocoa!"
S07E13,KEN,Why can't we use Seven?
S07E13,GEORGE,It's my name. I made it up. You can't just steal it.
S07E13,CARRIE,"Well, it's not as if Susan's pregnant. You've already postponed The wedding. Who knows if you'll ever get married."
S07E13,GEORGE,"Hey, hey hey. Don't worry about me. I'm not a waffler. I don't waffle!"
S07E13,KEN,"Right, we're both big Mickey Mantle fans, and we love the name. It's very unusual."
S07E13,GEORGE,(shouting) What happened to Soda?! I thought we all agreed on Soda.
S07E13,KEN,"(emphatic) Well, we don't care for Soda."
S07E13,GEORGE,You don't care for Soda?!
S07E13,CARRIE,"(worked up) No, no. We don't like Soda at all!"
S07E13,GEORGE,"(shouting) How d'you not like Soda?! It's bubbly, it's refreshing!"
S07E13,CARRIE,Oh!
S07E13,KEN,What is it?
S07E13,CARRIE,I felt something.
S07E13,KEN,"Are you okay, honey?"
S07E13,CARRIE,I think I'm going into labour.
S07E13,KEN,"Oh god, oh god. Okay, let's not panic. Let's just get to the hospital..."
S07E13,CARRIE,Okay.
S07E13,KEN,"...Alright? I got the suitcase packed, right here."
S07E13,GEORGE,What about Six?
S07E13,GEORGE,Nine. Thirt... thirteen's no good.
S07E13,GEORGE,Fourteen. (shouting after Ken) Fourteen!
S07E13,CHRISTIE,"Are you okay, Jerry? You seem quiet."
S07E13,JERRY,"No, I'm just a little uh, worn out."
S07E13,CHRISTIE,I know exactly what you mean.
S07E13,JERRY,"Oh, I'm sure you do."
S07E13,JERRY (V.O.),"What in god's name is going on here? Is she wearing the same thing over and over again? Or does she have a closet full of these, like Superman? I've got to unlock this mystery."
S07E13,CHRISTIE,(horrified) Oh my god!
S07E13,JERRY,Oh.
S07E13,CHRISTIE,"Ahh. I can't go to the movies like this. Do you mind if we go back to my apartment, so I can change?"
S07E13,JERRY,"Change? (thoughtful) Yes, I think that's a super idea."
S07E13,CARRIE,Are we almost there?
S07E13,KEN,"Just keep breathing, okay."
S07E13,CARRIE,"(deep breaths) Okay, okay."
S07E13,KEN,Okay.
S07E13,GEORGE,"(to Carrie) You know, the thing is, I kinda promised the widow Mantle that I would name my baby Seven."
S07E13,KEN,"Now's not the best time, George!"
S07E13,GEORGE,"(to Carrie) It's just that, I know her, and boy..."
S07E13,KEN,(firm) George! She's in labour!
S07E13,GEORGE,(angry shout) So am I!
S07E13,NEWMAN,"Well, you've both presented very convincing arguments. On the one hand, Elaine, your promise was given in haste. But was it not still a promise? Hmm?"
S07E13,NEWMAN,"And, Kramer, you did provide a service in exchange for compensation. But, does the fee, once paid, not entitle the buyer to some assurance Of reliability? Hmm? Huh? Ahh. These were not easy questions to answer. Not for any man..."
S07E13,NEWMAN,"...But I have made a decision. (revelatory) We will cut the bike down the middle, and give half to each of you."
S07E13,ELAINE,(shout) What?! This is your solution?! To ruin the bike?!
S07E13,ELAINE,"Alright, fine. Fine. Go ahead. (standing) Cut the stupid thing in half."
S07E13,KRAMER,"No, no, no. Give it to her. I'd rather it belonged to another than see it destroyed. Newman, give it to her, I beg you."
S07E13,ELAINE,"Yeah, yeah, y-yeah."
S07E13,NEWMAN,"Not so fast, Elaine! Only the bike's true owner would rather give it away than see it come to harm. Kramer, the bike is yours!"
S07E13,ELAINE,What?!
S07E13,KRAMER,"Sweet justice. Newman, you are wise."
S07E13,ELAINE,"(frustration) But this isn't fair! Lookit, my neck is still hurting me, and now you have the bike?!"
S07E13,KRAMER,"Well, tell it to the judge, honey. I'm going for a ride."
S07E13,CHRISTIE,Here we are.
S07E13,JERRY,"(looking around) Ah, so this is the Fortress of Solitude."
S07E13,CHRISTIE,"Well, I guess I'll go change."
S07E13,JERRY,"Yes, change. By all means, change."
S07E13,JERRY (V.O.),"August seventeen, nineteen-ninety-two. The same dress! She never changes! Oh my god. (looking around) She's gotta have hundreds of these dresses."
S07E13,JERRY (V.O.),There must be a secret stash around here somewhere.
S07E13,CHRISTIE,Ahem! Are you looking for something?
S07E13,JERRY,What're you doing? I thought you were changing.
S07E13,CHRISTIE,"No, I, I'm thinking we should just call it a night."
S07E13,JERRY,"No, no. C'mon, put something else on. It's early, let's go out."
S07E13,CHRISTIE,"If it's all the same to you, I think I'm just gonna go to bed."
S07E13,JERRY,"You know, I'm kinda tired myself. Maybe I'll just sleep here on The couch. Then in the morning, you'll get dressed, we'll walk out together. Both dressed, different clothes. Well, I'll be in the same clothes. You'll of course be in different clothes, because it's your apartment. But we'll go downstairs, me in my same clothes, you in your different clothes."
S07E13,CHRISTIE,(unequivocal) Jerry. I don't think so.
S07E13,JERRY,You wanna throw something on and walk me to a cab?
S07E13,CHRISTIE,(gesturing) Get out.
S07E13,JERRY,(pleading) Tell me what you're wearing tomorrow. I'll help you lay it out on the bed.
S07E13,KEN,"Okay, breathe, honey. Breathe."
S07E13,GEORGE,"(to Carrie) You know, you're really being very selfish. It would be nice if you would think of someone other than yourself every now and then!"
S07E13,CARRIE,(shouts) I'm having a baby!!
S07E13,KEN,"George, you're not getting Seven! Now get outta here!!"
S07E13,GEORGE,(desperate) Please! I have so little!
S07E13,ORDERLY,"Sorry sir, it's family only."
S07E13,GEORGE,I'm family. I'm having sex with the cousin!
S07E13,GEORGE,Seven!!
S07E13,JERRY,"Hello, Christie? I was wondering if we could get together again? (listens) Oh really? Well you can't break up with me over the phone. C'mon, you gotta do this in person. It doesn't even have to be one on one, you can bring a group of friends. I just wanna see you. Wait, don't hang up on me. (hurriedly) Why d'you wear the same dress all the time? Hello."
S07E13,KRAMER,"(indicating the cereal) Hey, Jerry, if you're gonna be snacking on these, you can't expect me to pay for the whole box."
S07E13,JERRY,"Alright, hobo Joe. I didn't wanna put a damper on your little Smorgasbord here, but it's the end of the week, so I added up your tab."
S07E13,KRAMER,(does a double take) Yikes.
S07E13,JERRY,I know. Pretty steep.
S07E13,KRAMER,"Well, I don't have this kind of cash."
S07E13,JERRY,Few do.
S07E13,KRAMER,I'm good for it.
S07E13,JERRY,"Yeah, well, until this bill is paid..."
S07E13,JERRY,...the food court is closed.
S07E13,KRAMER,"(opening the door) Alright. I'll get that money for you in five minutes. And, don't eat any more."
S07E13,ELAINE,"Hey, that's my bike! Along the sidewalk comes a happy-looking Newman, pedalling the Schwinn for all he's worth. He rings the bell."
S07E13,NEWMAN,Gangway!
S07E13,ELAINE,This is my bike!
S07E13,NEWMAN,"Oh no. No no no no. I bought it from Kramer. He was hard up for cash. Fifty bucks! (he laughs) Can you believe it? Of course, I had to make some minor modifications, you know. Solid tires, reinforced seatpost, heavy duty shocks. But, baby, this is one sweet ride."
S07E13,ELAINE,"(chasing Newman) No, you better gimme back that bike. Newman, gimme..."
S07E13,NEWMAN,Hey!! Help me!
S07E14,KRAMER,Hey! You're back!
S07E14,JERRY,"Oh, I'm back, baby."
S07E14,KRAMER,"Yeah, how was it?"
S07E14,JERRY,Great. One of the best jobs I ever had.
S07E14,KRAMER,Good for you.
S07E14,JERRY,I killed.
S07E14,KRAMER,You killed.
S07E14,JERRY,"(taking off his jacket) Slaughtered. Wiped the floor with 'em and (hanging up jacket) not only that, the money was unbelievable."
S07E14,KRAMER,Unbelievable.
S07E14,JERRY,Yeah. Highest paying job I ever had.
S07E14,KRAMER,How much?
S07E14,JERRY,"(reluctant) Nah, nah. I'd rather..."
S07E14,KRAMER,"Aw, c'mon."
S07E14,JERRY,"Nah. It's not good for friends to talk about money, it can affect the friendship."
S07E14,KRAMER,I tell you how much I make.
S07E14,JERRY,And I'm always impressed.
S07E14,KRAMER,"Just show me the cheque, c'mon."
S07E14,JERRY,"Awright, fine. You wanna see it?"
S07E14,KRAMER,I wanna see it.
S07E14,JERRY,Okay.
S07E14,JERRY,"Here, check that out."
S07E14,KRAMER,(stunned) Whuf! This is unbelievable.
S07E14,JERRY,I told you.
S07E14,KRAMER,"My god, you're rich."
S07E14,JERRY,(taking back the check) Oh yeah.
S07E14,KRAMER,I didn't know you made that kinda money. (subdued) Jeez.
S07E14,JERRY,What?
S07E14,KRAMER,I don't think I can talk to you any more. I feel inferior.
S07E14,JERRY,I never shoulda told you.
S07E14,KRAMER,"You know, Jerry, I think this changes the relationship. I mean, I feel it. Do you feel it?"
S07E14,JERRY,"No, I can't feel anything."
S07E14,KRAMER,"Well, what're you gonna do with all that money?"
S07E14,JERRY,"Actually, I was thinking of donating a large portion of it to charity."
S07E14,KRAMER,(pleased) Really?
S07E14,JERRY,(deadpan) No.
S07E14,KRAMER,"Well, you should, Jerry."
S07E14,JERRY,"No, to tell you the truth, I was thinking of buying my father a new car."
S07E14,KRAMER,"Now, you see, that's nice."
S07E14,JERRY,Maybe a Cadillac.
S07E14,KRAMER,(smiles) Cadillac. Ooh-la-la.
S07E14,JERRY,"Yeah. (thinking) That would really blow his mind. He's always wanted one, his whole life, he's never been able to afford it. (decisive) I'm gonna do it."
S07E14,KRAMER,You're gonna score some big points with the man upstairs on this one.
S07E14,JERRY,"Oh, isn't that what it's all about?"
S07E14,ELAINE,Who was Pippi Longstocking?
S07E14,KATY,"Pippi Longstocking? (thoughtful) Hmm, I don't don't know."
S07E14,ELAINE,Did she have anything to do with Hitler?
S07E14,KATY,Hitler? (thinks) Maybe.
S07E14,GEORGE,Hey.
S07E14,ELAINE,Hey George.
S07E14,GEORGE,Have you seen Jerry? (sitting beside Elaine) I told him two o'clock.
S07E14,ELAINE,(indicating) You remember Katy?
S07E14,GEORGE,"(distracted) Mm? (acknowledges Katy) Oh, hi. Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. We met uh, skiing that time. You're uh, married to the eye guy."
S07E14,KATY,"Also ear, nose and throat."
S07E14,GEORGE,Nose. (chuckles) What's the worst that can happen to a nose? What does it get? Stuffed? (chuckles)
S07E14,KATY,(amused) He's funny.
S07E14,ELAINE,"Ah, you don't have to tell me."
S07E14,GEORGE,"Ahh, ladies, please, please. (chuckles)"
S07E14,ELAINE,"Oh, you know what? He got engaged."
S07E14,KATY,"Oh, you did? (disappointed) Oh."
S07E14,GEORGE,What? Is that bad?
S07E14,KATY,I actually would've set you up with a friend of mine.
S07E14,GEORGE,"Oh-ho, yeah?"
S07E14,KATY,"You'd be perfect for her. She loves quirky, funny guys."
S07E14,GEORGE,(curious) Bald? Uh?
S07E14,KATY,Loves bald.
S07E14,GEORGE,"Loves bald? (laughs) Wow. Who uh, who is she?"
S07E14,KATY,Marisa Tomei.
S07E14,GEORGE,(taken aback) The actress?
S07E14,KATY,Yeah.
S07E14,GEORGE,You're friends with Marisa Tomei?
S07E14,KATY,That's right.
S07E14,GEORGE,"(getting excited) That's, that's incredible. My Cousin Vinnie, I love her, she was fantastic!"
S07E14,KATY,"Yeah, I know."
S07E14,GEORGE,(more excitement) You were gonna fix me up with her?
S07E14,KATY,"Yeah, she's just been sitting home."
S07E14,GEORGE,"(fever pitch) Marisa Tomei's sitting home, Elaine! Wh..why didn't you tell me that Katy was friends with Marisa Tomei?!"
S07E14,ELAINE,"(deadpan) Oh, I don't know what I was thinking."
S07E14,JERRY,"I want this baby fully loaded. (listens) Well, how soon can you get it there? (listens) Oh, that's terrific. (listens) Okay, thanks, bye."
S07E14,JERRY,"Hey, guess what. I just bought my father a Cadillac"
S07E14,GEORGE,"Really? Wow, you're quite the good son."
S07E14,JERRY,"Yeah, I'm a very good boy. I'm flying down there and surprising him."
S07E14,GEORGE,You gonna sleep on the fold-out?
S07E14,JERRY,"(joyless) Yeah, yes."
S07E14,GEORGE,"Uh, let me ask you something. You uh, you ever hear of Marisa Tomei?"
S07E14,JERRY,The actress?
S07E14,GEORGE,"Yeah. She's uh, she's something, isn't she?"
S07E14,JERRY,Oh yeah.
S07E14,GEORGE,"Well, you know Katy, Elaine's friend?"
S07E14,JERRY,Yeah?
S07E14,GEORGE,She happens to be very good friends with her.
S07E14,JERRY,Marisa Tomei?
S07E14,GEORGE,Uh-hmm.
S07E14,JERRY,How does she know Marisa Tomei?
S07E14,GEORGE,"I don't know, I didn't ask."
S07E14,JERRY,You didn't ask how she knows Marisa Tomei?
S07E14,GEORGE,Not the point!
S07E14,JERRY,Alright.
S07E14,GEORGE,Can I finish?
S07E14,JERRY,"Go ahead. Seems like a reasonable question, is all I'm saying. I would've asked her."
S07E14,GEORGE,"Alright! So, she said, that she could've fixed me up with her."
S07E14,JERRY,"What d'you mean, could've?"
S07E14,GEORGE,"Well, you know, if I uh, wasn't engaged."
S07E14,JERRY,Ohh!
S07E14,GEORGE,Coulda fixed me up with Marisa Tomei. She said I was just her type!
S07E14,JERRY,Really?
S07E14,GEORGE,"(getting animated) Yeah. Yeah. You know the odds of me being anyone's type?! I have never been anyone's type, but apparently, this Marisa Tomei loves funny, quirky, bald men."
S07E14,JERRY,"You know, she won an academy award?"
S07E14,GEORGE,"(sarcasm) Hu-hu, like I don't know that? (excitement) My Cousin Vinnie, I love that! I, George Costanza, could be on a date with an Oscar winner! An Oscar winner, Jerry! You know what that's like? It's like if fifty years ago, someone fixed me up with Katherine Hepburn? Same thing!"
S07E14,JERRY,Now there's a match. You and Katherine Hepburn.
S07E14,GEORGE,"I mean, you've seen her, right?"
S07E14,JERRY,Katherine Hepburn? Oh yeah.
S07E14,GEORGE,(shout) Marisa Tomei!
S07E14,JERRY,"Yeah, yeah, yeah."
S07E14,GEORGE,"I mean, she's beautiful, right? She's just my type. The dark hair, the full lips."
S07E14,JERRY,You like full lips.
S07E14,GEORGE,"Oh, I love full lips. Something you can really put the lipstick on."
S07E14,JERRY,Mmm-mmm. Too bad you're engaged.
S07E14,GEORGE,"(downcast) Yeah, too bad. Too bad."
S07E14,JERRY,(about the pie) This is no good.
S07E14,JERRY,Hi.
S07E14,NICK,"Hi, uh, excuse me. I'm uh, I'm with Plaza Cable. I'm sorry to bother you. I...I'm looking for the guy who lives over here. Been waiting about uh, heh, two hours. You uh, happen to know where he is?"
S07E14,JERRY,No.
S07E14,NICK,"If you see him, Could you just tell him the cable company was here?"
S07E14,JERRY,Sure.
S07E14,NICK,Thanks.
S07E14,JERRY,(about the cable guy) Nice people.
S07E14,GEORGE,"Listen, lemme ask you a question. What if I got a cup of coffee with her?"
S07E14,JERRY,"Well, what about Susan?"
S07E14,GEORGE,(worked up) I can't have a cup of coffee with a person?! I'm not allowed to have coffee?!
S07E14,JERRY,Would you tell Susan about it?
S07E14,GEORGE,(frustrated) Not necessarily.
S07E14,JERRY,"Well, if you can't tell Susan about it, then there's something wrong."
S07E14,GEORGE,(shouts) Of course there's something wrong! (points at Jerry) We had a pact!
S07E14,JERRY,"Hey, cable guy's looking for you."
S07E14,KRAMER,"Oh, yeah?"
S07E14,JERRY,Yeah.
S07E14,KRAMER,"Oh. Yeah, I been getting HBO and Showtime for free. See, they just found out about it, so now they wanna come and take it out."
S07E14,JERRY,"Well, said he was waiting about two hours. Seemed a little put out."
S07E14,KRAMER,"Oh, was he? Was he? I guess the cable man doesn't like to be kept waiting."
S07E14,JERRY,You don't seem too bothered by it.
S07E14,KRAMER,"You remember what they did to me ten years ago? ""Oh, we'll be there in the morning between nine and one"", or ""We'll be there between two and six""! (quiet anger) And I sat there, hour after hour, without so much as a phone call. Finally, they show up, no apology, tracking mud all over my nice clean floors. (malice) Now, they want me to accommodate them. Well, looks like the shoe's on the other foot, doesn't it?"
S07E14,JERRY,"Boy, I've never seen you like this."
S07E14,KRAMER,"Oh, you don't wanna get on my bad side."
S07E14,MARISA,"...positrack, which was not available on the sixty-four Buick Skylark."
S07E14,SUSAN,Hey. (glances at TV) Hey what're you watching? What is that? My Cousin Vinnie?
S07E14,GEORGE,Yeah.
S07E14,SUSAN,I thought you saw that before. How come you're watching that again?
S07E14,GEORGE,I..I..I dunno.
S07E14,SUSAN,"Did you know Marisa Tomei won an Oscar for that? Boy, she's beautiful, don't you think? I wish I looked like that."
S07E14,SUSAN,Turn it off. You're making me jealous. I'm gonna think you like her more than you like me.
S07E14,GEORGE,"(forcing a laugh) Hu, ha."
S07E14,ELAINE (O.C.),Hello.
S07E14,GEORGE,"(whispering) Elaine, it's me, George."
S07E14,ELAINE,George. How come you're whispering?
S07E14,GEORGE,"(still quiet) Never mind, never mind. I need you to do me a favour. Uhm, remember what we were talking about at the coffee shop earlier?"
S07E14,ELAINE,No.
S07E14,GEORGE,"(still quiet) Think, a second. You know, your friend was talking about me and, you know..."
S07E14,ELAINE,"Ech, George, I have no idea what you're talking about."
S07E14,GEORGE,(still quiet) The actress.
S07E14,ELAINE,What?
S07E14,GEORGE,(shouts) Marisa Tomei!
S07E14,SUSAN (O.C.),What?
S07E14,GEORGE,"(calling to Susan) Uh, ah, nothing. Nothing."
S07E14,ELAINE,"Oh, yeah. Yeah, what about her?"
S07E14,GEORGE,"Well, uhm, I think I'd like to do it."
S07E14,ELAINE,"What? (shocked) What?! George, no way. You're engaged!"
S07E14,GEORGE,"A cup of coffee. That, that doesn't mean anything."
S07E14,ELAINE,Uhh. No George!
S07E14,GEORGE,Elaine.
S07E14,ELAINE,Forget it!
S07E14,GEORGE,Elaine! (shouts) ELAINE!!
S07E14,GEORGE,"D'oh...Oh, oh, the judge! I hate this guy!"
S07E14,ELAINE,I can't believe you're buying your father a car.
S07E14,JERRY,"And, best of all, it's a Cadillac."
S07E14,ELAINE,(sharp intake of breath) Hoh. A Cadillac! (impressed) Wow.
S07E14,ELAINE,I had no idea you had this kind of money.
S07E14,JERRY,"Ahh, I uh, I don't like to talk about it."
S07E14,ELAINE,"Yeah, I thought you were doing okay. I just didn't think you were in this kind of, you know, uh... position."
S07E14,JERRY,"Ah, it's just money."
S07E14,ELAINE,"(smiling) So, when're you getting back from Florida?"
S07E14,JERRY,"Oh, I don't know, play it by ear. Why?"
S07E14,ELAINE,"I don't know. (big smile) Just, things seem a little more exciting when you're around. That's all."
S07E14,JERRY,Are you okay?
S07E14,ELAINE,"(squeaky) Sure, sure."
S07E14,JERRY,What was that?
S07E14,KRAMER,"Quiet, quiet."
S07E14,NICK,"Hey, uh, you know the guy who lives here?"
S07E14,GEORGE,Yeah.
S07E14,NICK,(quietly angry) All morning I been waiting here. All morning.
S07E14,NICK,(still angry) The guy says he's gonna be home. I show up and all I do is wait. I'm getting pretty sick and tired of it. I'm not gonna put up with it much longer.
S07E14,KRAMER,I'm loving this.
S07E14,GEORGE,"Kramer, there's a guy out here that..."
S07E14,KRAMER,"Yeah, yeah. I know, I know."
S07E14,GEORGE,"(pointedly to Elaine) Oh. Thanks very much for yesterday, by the way."
S07E14,ELAINE,"Jerry, he want me to fix him up with Marisa Tomei. I am not gonna be a part of this!"
S07E14,GEORGE,(animated) Fixed up? A cup of coffee! A cup of coffee is not a fix up!
S07E14,ELAINE,You wanna meet her. You wanna see if she likes you?
S07E14,GEORGE,(defensive) So what? So what if I do?
S07E14,ELAINE,(shrill) You're engaged!
S07E14,GEORGE,"(worked up) I'm aware! I'm aware!! But this is Marisa Tomei, Elaine. An Oscar winner! How can I live the rest of my life, knowing I coulda been with Marisa Tomei? She said I was just her type! She loves short, stocky, balding funny men!"
S07E14,JERRY,I notice you threw 'stocky' in there.
S07E14,GEORGE,"Yeah, what the hell?!"
S07E14,ELAINE,George! It's cheating.
S07E14,GEORGE,(adamant) It's not cheating if there's no sex!
S07E14,ELAINE,Yes it is!
S07E14,GEORGE,(frustrated) Ahh!
S07E14,ELAINE,(looking for support) Jerry!
S07E14,JERRY,"Uhm, hold, hold on a second. (pauses counting) I'm, I'm sorry, I didn't hear what you said."
S07E14,GEORGE,"(pleading) Elaine, c'mon. Would you just make the call? (indicates the phone) Please, make the call."
S07E14,ELAINE,"(distractedly) Yeah, yeah, fine, I'll make..."
S07E14,GEORGE,(triumph) Alright.
S07E14,ELAINE,Eight-fifty.
S07E14,JERRY,"Oh, right."
S07E14,ELAINE,"So uh, how are you getting to the airport? D'you need a ride, or..."
S07E14,JERRY,"No, don't be silly, I've arranged a car."
S07E14,ELAINE,"You sure? You sure? 'Cos, you know..."
S07E14,JERRY,Maybe I'll let you pick me up.
S07E14,ELAINE,(big smile) Okay.
S07E14,ELAINE,"Oh, hi. Uhm, is Katy there? (listens) Wh...? Uhm, what? (listens) Oh, really?"
S07E14,ELAINE,"Well, could you tell her Elaine called? Yeah, thanks."
S07E14,ELAINE,"Huh, she's in the hospital. (concerned) She has an arrhythmia."
S07E14,GEORGE,(impatient) What about Marisa Tomei?!
S07E14,HELEN,"Morty, what d'you have to open this box for? (waving at another box) There's already a box of cookies open."
S07E14,MORTY,I wanted a Chip Ahoy.
S07E14,HELEN,I don't like all these open boxes.
S07E14,MORTY,"Look, I got a few good years left. If I want a Chip Ahoy, I'm having it."
S07E14,JERRY,Surprise!
S07E14,MORTY,(shout) Jerry!
S07E14,HELEN,"(shock) Oh, my god!"
S07E14,MORTY,What the hell are you doing here?
S07E14,JERRY,I'm a good son.
S07E14,HELEN,Just like that? No calls?
S07E14,JERRY,Just like that.
S07E14,MORTY,"Boy, you are really something."
S07E14,HELEN,To what do we owe this great honour?
S07E14,JERRY,You wanna know? Come on outside.
S07E14,MORTY,Outside? What's going on?
S07E14,HELEN,"Whenever Jerry comes, something exciting happens."
S07E14,MORTY,(laughs) Heh hah!
S07E14,JERRY,"C'mon, c'mon."
S07E14,JERRY,"Well, what d'you think?"
S07E14,MORTY,Look at this! Look at this! (excited) You bought a Cadillac?!
S07E14,JERRY,I bought it for you. It's yours.
S07E14,MORTY,You what? You bought me a Cadillac?
S07E14,JERRY,I bought you a Cadillac. (hands over the keys) Here you go.
S07E14,HELEN,"(sharply, to Jerry) Are you out of your mind?"
S07E14,JERRY,What?
S07E14,MORTY,(to Helen) You don't want it? Are you kidding?
S07E14,HELEN,He's not buying us a Cadillac.
S07E14,MORTY,"What are you, nuts?"
S07E14,HELEN,"It's a very nice gesture Jerry, but take it back."
S07E14,MORTY,(to Jerry) Can you believe this?!
S07E14,HELEN,I'm not letting him buy us a Cadillac. He hasn't got that kind of money.
S07E14,JERRY,How d'you know?
S07E14,HELEN,"Oh, get out of here Mister Big Shot."
S07E14,JERRY,Why can't I buy my father a car?
S07E14,HELEN,Your father doesn't need a car.
S07E14,MORTY,"Yes, I do!"
S07E14,HELEN,"Oh, Morty."
S07E14,MORTY,We're keeping it.
S07E14,HELEN,Over my dead body.
S07E14,JERRY,"(under his breath) Well, this worked out just as I had hoped."
S07E14,MACHINE (KRAMER),Giddyup.
S07E14,NICK (O.C.),"Yeah, this is Nick Stevens, from Plaza Cable."
S07E14,NICK (O.C.),"Well, I waited all morning again. You said you were gonna be there from nine to one."
S07E14,NICK (O.C.),"I was there. Where were you? You think I got nothing better to do than stand outside all morning, waiting for you to show up?!"
S07E14,NICK (O.C.),You're not gonna get away with this!
S07E14,MORTY,"Hey Jerry, look at this. My seat's got a memory, in case somebody moves it. I could be in prison for five years. I come out, my seat goes right back to where I like it."
S07E14,JERRY,That's what I was thinking.
S07E14,JACK,"(pointing) Hello, Jerry."
S07E14,JERRY,"Hiya, Jack."
S07E14,MORTY,"(indicating) So, how d'you like this?"
S07E14,JACK,Who's car?
S07E14,MORTY,It's mine.
S07E14,JACK,Yours?
S07E14,MORTY,That's right. My son bought it for me.
S07E14,JACK,He what?
S07E14,MORTY,My son bought me the car. It's a present.
S07E14,JACK,(disbelief) You bought it?
S07E14,JERRY,That's right. I bought it.
S07E14,MORTY,You ever see one so nice?
S07E14,JACK,Some car.
S07E14,MORTY,You wanna take a ride?
S07E14,JACK,"No, thank you."
S07E14,MORTY,"C'mon, take a ride."
S07E14,JACK,I don't wanna take a ride.
S07E14,MORTY,Why not?
S07E14,JACK,I don't feel like taking a ride. Do I have to take a ride?!
S07E14,JERRY,He doesn't wanna take a ride.
S07E14,MORTY,Uh huh.
S07E14,JACK,"(worked up) What d'you think? I've never ridden in a Cadillac before? Believe me, I've ridden in a Cadillac hundreds of times. Thousands."
S07E14,MORTY,(skeptical) Thousands?!
S07E14,JACK,"What? D'you think you're such a big shot now, because you got a Cadillac?"
S07E14,MORTY,(dismissive) Ahh!
S07E14,JACK,(dismissive) Yaah!
S07E14,MORTY,Could you believe that guy?
S07E14,JERRY,Aahh!
S07E14,GEORGE,"Anyway, I was thinking about what you said. About uh, me and Marisa."
S07E14,GEORGE,"You know, about the uh, two of us getting together. And I know that I said I was engaged, but (laughs) uh, you know, it's really just something you say. It's like, going steady. You know uh, going steady, engaged, it's, it's all just stuff you say. (chuckles) Anyway, I was watching uh, My Cousin Vinnie, on the uh, on the tape the other day, and I was thinking that uh, you know, the two of us might take a meeting, as they say. (chuckles) So, what d'you, what d'you think?"
S07E14,GEORGE,"(urgent) Move a pinkie, if it's yes. Can you move a pinkie?"
S07E14,KRAMER,Y'hello.
S07E14,NICK (O.C.),"(inexpertly disguising his voice) Hi, uh ah, Mister Kramer, ah, this is McNab down at the phone company. We've got a report about some trouble on your line."
S07E14,KRAMER,"Hmm. Well, I haven't had any trouble."
S07E14,NICK (O.C.),"Uh, the thing is, we happen to have a man right in your neighbourhood."
S07E14,KRAMER,"(playing along) Ohh, is that right? Well, I have been having a little trouble with my call-waiting."
S07E14,NICK,We can fix that. We can fix that.
S07E14,KRAMER,"(sitting back on the couch) Oh, can you? That's funny, because, as it happens, I don't have call-waiting. Seems to me that the phone company would know that."
S07E14,NICK,"Oh, right. (laughing it off) I'm sorry, I was looking at the wrong work order."
S07E14,KRAMER,Yeah. Could you hold on for a second? I've got something on the stove.
S07E14,KRAMER,"Hey, McNab!"
S07E14,KRAMER,Chunnel's on HBO tonight. Why don't you stop by?
S07E14,MORTY,"Alright. Next thing on the agenda, the restoration of the fence at the Briarwood gate. At the present time, we are still accepting bids."
S07E14,HERB,"C'mon Morty, it's been broken for six months already. What the hell are you doing?"
S07E14,MORTY,"Well, I, as your president, have to find the best price, and right now, I for one, do not think it's cost-feasible."
S07E14,JACK,(half to himself) I'll bet you don't.
S07E14,MORTY,What was that?
S07E14,JACK,"C'mon Morty, the jig is up!"
S07E14,MORTY,What're you talking about?
S07E14,JACK,"I'm sorry. I'm sitting here, the whole meeting, holding my tongue. I've known you a long time, Morty, but I cannot hold it in any longer."
S07E14,HERB,"What's going on, Jack?"
S07E14,JACK,I'll tell you what's going on. Morty Seinfeld has been stealing funds from the treasury.
S07E14,MORTY,Stealing?!
S07E14,RALPH,What proof do you have?
S07E14,JACK,Proof? You want proof? He's driving around in a brand new Cadillac. Now what more proof do you want?
S07E14,MORTY,My son bought me that car!
S07E14,JACK,Your son?
S07E14,MORTY,Yeah.
S07E14,JACK,"Your son could never afford that car. We all saw his act, last year, at the playhouse. He's lucky he can pay his rent!"
S07E14,HERB,Jack's right! He stinks!
S07E14,RALPH,It's his material.
S07E14,MORTY,"I tell you, he bought it for me!"
S07E14,HERB,(bangs table with his fist) I move for a full investigation!
S07E14,RALPH,I second.
S07E14,MARISA,...go introduce myself.
S07E14,SUSAN,"Hey! What're you watching? (looks at TV) Only You? That's another Marisa Tomei movie, and you've seen that one too. (jokingly) What, d'you have a thing for her?"
S07E14,GEORGE,"(laughing it off and trying too hard) Yeah, yeah. I have a thing for Marisa Tomei. Like she would ever go out with a short, stocky, bald man. (forced laughter) Hu hu, ha ha. Like that's her type. Huh. She's an Oscar winner. (nervous laughter) He heh. Besides, I don't even know her. It's not like anyone's trying to fix us up. Who, who would try and fix me up with Marisa Tomei?"
S07E14,SUSAN,What are you talking about?
S07E14,MARISA,Have I told you how much I love you today?
S07E14,GEORGE,Not in the last fifteen minutes.
S07E14,MARISA,"Well, I do love you very much."
S07E14,GEORGE,"And I love you, Marisa."
S07E14,MARISA,"Well then, c'mon, get dressed. We're going to be late for the premiere."
S07E14,HELEN,Impeachment?
S07E14,MORTY,That's right. Have you ever heard of anything like that?
S07E14,HELEN,Can they do that?
S07E14,MORTY,If they get the votes.
S07E14,HELEN,I told you we shouldn't have let him give us the car.
S07E14,JERRY,Didn't you tell 'em I got the bill of sale? That proves I paid for it.
S07E14,MORTY,It doesn't make a difference. They think we're in cahoots.
S07E14,JERRY,"You know, you could put a fence around these condos, and call it an insane asylum. Nobody would know the difference!"
S07E14,MORTY,No-one's ever been impeached before. I couldn't live here. We'd have to move to Boca.
S07E14,EVELYN,Hello?
S07E14,JERRY,"Oh, hi Evelyn."
S07E14,EVELYN,"Hello, Jerry. (to the senior Seinfelds) I just got off the phone with Saul Brandus."
S07E14,HELEN,What'd he say?
S07E14,EVELYN,He's voting to impeach.
S07E14,EVELYN,"Not because he think you stole the money, but mainly because you never thanked him for giving you his aisle seat at Freddy Roman's show."
S07E14,MORTY,I did so thank him!
S07E14,HELEN,"(admonishing) No, he never heard you. (prods Morty's back) I told you he didn't hear you."
S07E14,MORTY,"Ah, he's deaf anyway."
S07E14,EVELYN,"Now, my sources tell me, there's three votes for impeachment, three votes against impeachment, and one undecided."
S07E14,MORTY,Who's that?
S07E14,EVELYN,Mrs Choate.
S07E14,JERRY,Who's she?
S07E14,MORTY,"Oh, that one. She's been a member of the board longer than anybody. She's very tough to deal with."
S07E14,HELEN,"Maybe we should have her over for coffee, and explain our side of it?"
S07E14,MORTY,That's a good idea.
S07E14,EVELYN,"Okay. I'll see you at the Lichtenberg's, tonight."
S07E14,HELEN,(surprise) The Lichtenberg's?
S07E14,EVELYN,"Yes, they're having a party."
S07E14,HELEN,We weren't invited.
S07E14,EVELYN,"Oh. Probably they think you're too good for them. You know, because of the car."
S07E15,JERRY (V.O.),"Last week, on Seinfeld."
S07E15,JERRY (V.O.),Ow. Stupid fold-out! Why'd they put the bar in the middle of the bed?
S07E15,JERRY,Hello?
S07E15,ELAINE,(flirtatious) Hi Jerry.
S07E15,JERRY,Elaine? Wh..what's going on?
S07E15,ELAINE,"(clears throat) I was thinking, I mean, I'm not really doing that much this weekend, and I thought, well, huh, what the hell, maybe I'll come down there and hang out a little."
S07E15,JERRY,"(a little confused) You wanna hang out here, at phase two of the Pines of Mar Gables?"
S07E15,ELAINE,"Well, it's just two hours by plane..."
S07E15,JERRY,"Gee, I dunno what to tell you."
S07E15,ELAINE,"Dammit! I got another call. Uh, hang on, don't hang up Jerry."
S07E15,ELAINE,Yeah?
S07E15,GEORGE,(urgent whisper) Elaine! You have got to get me Marisa Tomei's phone number!
S07E15,ELAINE,"(impatient) Okay, George, I am on the other line. I promise you, I'll get you her number."
S07E15,GEORGE,Yeahhh.
S07E15,ELAINE,Goodbye.
S07E15,ELAINE,(smiling and flirty) Hi.
S07E15,JERRY,Hi.
S07E15,ELAINE,"So, what d'you think?"
S07E15,JERRY,"Uh, I don't think so."
S07E15,ELAINE,(disappointed) Oh.
S07E15,JERRY,I'll be back on Monday.
S07E15,ELAINE,"Well, if you need that ride, just uhm, gimme a call. (little laugh) Heh. I can meet you at the gate, Jer."
S07E15,JERRY,"Yeah, yeah. Whatever. Alright, I'll see you."
S07E15,ELAINE,(urgent) Jerry? Jerry?
S07E15,JERRY,(putting the phone back to his ear) Yeah.
S07E15,ELAINE,(breathy) Bye.
S07E15,JERRY,Bye.
S07E15,KRAMER,Hello.
S07E15,JOHN,"Hello, Mister Kramer? This is John Hanaran, from Con Ed."
S07E15,KRAMER,"Ohh, it's Hanaran now, is it?"
S07E15,JOHN (V.O.),"Yeah. We've had some reports of power surges in your building. It seems some jokers were up on the roof, and they must've damaged some of the wires."
S07E15,KRAMER,"Oh, you don't say."
S07E15,JOHN,"(a little confused by Kramer) Yeah. Either way, we need to get into your apartment and do a safety check."
S07E15,KRAMER,"(impressed) Ohh, you're good. You are really good."
S07E15,JOHN,(confused) What're you talking about?
S07E15,GEORGE,"Marisa Tomei! I, just spoke to Marisa Tomei! (sitting opposite Elaine) And I wasn't even that nervous."
S07E15,GEORGE,"You know, I can't remember the last time I called a woman without being nervous. I, usually, I'm pacing all over the room, I'm..."
S07E15,ELAINE,"(looking at her watch) Okay, well that's all the time we have for today. Why don't we pick up with this next week?"
S07E15,GEORGE,"Hey, where you going?"
S07E15,ELAINE,I got stuff to do.
S07E15,GEORGE,What? You can't leave yet.
S07E15,ELAINE,Why not?
S07E15,GEORGE,We have to discuss my alibi.
S07E15,ELAINE,Alibi? What does that have to do with me?
S07E15,GEORGE,"I usually spend Saturday afternoons with Susan. She's gonna want to know what I'm doing. I can't use Jerry, he's in Florida."
S07E15,ELAINE,"Oh, so you wanna say you were with me?"
S07E15,GEORGE,Yes.
S07E15,ELAINE,"(pulls a face) Puh. Okay, fine. You were with me."
S07E15,GEORGE,"Wait a second, wait. Why are we together?"
S07E15,ELAINE,What is the difference?
S07E15,GEORGE,"Because, if you ever see her and it comes up, we have to be in sync. Hmm?"
S07E15,GEORGE,"Okay. Now, why do I have to see (points) you?"
S07E15,ELAINE,"Ah! Because, I'm going to the dentist, and I'm afraid, and I want you to go with me."
S07E15,GEORGE,(dismissive) It's no good.
S07E15,ELAINE,(pointedly) Okay. Fine.
S07E15,GEORGE,What?
S07E15,ELAINE,I don't like the way you just rejected my suggestion.
S07E15,GEORGE,"Hey, hey, let's not get so defensive here. This is a give and take process."
S07E15,ELAINE,"I thought that my suggestion was good. And, I think you could've been a little more tactful."
S07E15,GEORGE,"(explaining, with lots of hand gestures) Okay, look. We've never worked together on a lie. Now, you don't understand how I work. I have a certain way of working. Jerry and I have worked together a few times. He knows how I work. It's not a personal thing, y'know? We're just trying to come up with the best possible lie. That's what this is all about."
S07E15,ELAINE,(weary) Okay.
S07E15,GEORGE,Alright?
S07E15,ELAINE,Okay.
S07E15,GEORGE,Okay.
S07E15,ELAINE,Fine.
S07E15,GEORGE,Good.
S07E15,ELAINE,"Fine, fine, fine."
S07E15,GEORGE,Okay. How about this?
S07E15,ELAINE,What?
S07E15,GEORGE,(pleased with himself) You are having problems with your boyfriend and I am meeting you to discuss the situation.
S07E15,ELAINE,I don't have a boyfriend.
S07E15,GEORGE,(still pleased) She doesn't know that. We say that you do.
S07E15,ELAINE,(not convinced) Ech.
S07E15,GEORGE,It's good. Believe me.
S07E15,ELAINE,I thought my idea was just as good.
S07E15,GEORGE,The dentist thing?
S07E15,ELAINE,"(pointed) Yeah, right. The dentist thing."
S07E15,GEORGE,"Alright, the dentist thing was not good."
S07E15,ELAINE,"Okay, alright. What's his name? Who is he?"
S07E15,GEORGE,(after a moment's thought) Art Vandelay.
S07E15,ELAINE,(incredulity) Art Vandelay? This is my boyfriend?
S07E15,GEORGE,That's your boyfriend.
S07E15,ELAINE,What does he do?
S07E15,GEORGE,He's an importer.
S07E15,ELAINE,Just imports? No exports?
S07E15,GEORGE,(getting irritated) He's an importer-exporter. Okay?
S07E15,ELAINE,"Okay. So, I'm dating Art Vandelay. What is the problem we're discussing?"
S07E15,GEORGE,(thoughtful) Yes. Yes.
S07E15,ELAINE,(sighs) Yi-yi-yi.
S07E15,ELAINE,"Ah! (explaining, with hand gestures) How 'bout this? How about, he's thinking of quitting the exporting, and just focussing in on the importing. And this is causing a problem, because, why not do both?"
S07E15,ELAINE,"(irked) Oh, what? You don't like that suggestion either?"
S07E15,GEORGE,It's very complicated.
S07E15,ELAINE,"(definitely irritated) You know, it seems to me that it's all you, and none of my ideas are getting in. You know, I mean, you just know it all and I am Miss Stupid. Right?"
S07E15,MORTY,What're you doing? Are you making coffee?
S07E15,HELEN,Yeah.
S07E15,MORTY,"Well, maybe you better make a pot of tea, too."
S07E15,HELEN,"Morty, you're driving me crazy."
S07E15,MORTY,"Look, I don't want anything to go wrong. If this woman votes to impeach me, I'll be a laughing stock."
S07E15,HELEN,You wanna drive a Cadillac? Expect to pay the consequences.
S07E15,MORTY,There she is.
S07E15,MORTY,"Hello. Hello, Mrs Choate."
S07E15,HELEN,"Oh, come in, come in. May I take your coat."
S07E15,MRS. CHOATE,"No, no. I prefer to wear it. Nobody's taking my coat."
S07E15,HELEN,"Ah, how 'bout a cup of coffee or something?"
S07E15,MRS. CHOATE,"Coffee? Ach. I'll take hot water with lemon, if you have it."
S07E15,HELEN,I'll see. (indicating the couch) Have a seat. That's a lovely scarf you're wearing. Where did you get it?
S07E15,MRS. CHOATE,"Ahh, they're a dime a dozen."
S07E15,HELEN,"Oh, hi Jerry. Mrs Choate, (indicating) this is my son, Jerry."
S07E15,JERRY,Gimme that rye!)
S07E15,MRS. CHOATE,"Stop it. Let go. Help! Someone, help!"
S07E15,JERRY,"Shut up, you old bag!"
S07E15,MRS. CHOATE,"(shouting after him) Thief! Stop him! Stop him, he's got my rye!"
S07E15,JERRY,Nice to meet you.
S07E15,MRS. CHOATE,Hello.
S07E15,MORTY,"(holding Jerry's shoulders) Jerry lives in New York. You just came from New York, didn't you?"
S07E15,MRS. CHOATE,"Yeah. I was visiting my daughter, and I'll never go back. The crime there is just terrible. Do you know I got mugged for a marble rye, right on the street?"
S07E15,HELEN,"(sympathy) Oh, that's terrible. They stole a rye? Why would they steal a rye?"
S07E15,MORTY,That's what the city's turning into. They'll steal anything.
S07E15,MRS. CHOATE,They're like savages.
S07E15,JERRY,"Yeah, there's some sickos out there."
S07E15,MRS. CHOATE,(peering at Jerry) You look very familiar. Have we ever met?
S07E15,JERRY,You ever go to Camp Tiyoga?
S07E15,HELEN,Maybe you've seen him on television.
S07E15,MORTY,Jerry's a comedian.
S07E15,MRS. CHOATE,"Naw, I don't watch TV."
S07E15,JERRY,"(opening the door) Well, it was nice meeting you."
S07E15,MORTY,"Jerry, don't go."
S07E15,JERRY,"Ah, I think I'll go."
S07E15,MRS. CHOATE,"So, Morty, what's this all about? What d'you want?"
S07E15,SUSAN,"Hey, where're you going?"
S07E15,GEORGE,Wha..? I didn't tell you? I gotta go meet Elaine.
S07E15,SUSAN,Elaine? What for?
S07E15,GEORGE,I don't know. She..She's having some problems with this guy she's seeing.
S07E15,SUSAN,I didn't even know she was dating anyone.
S07E15,GEORGE,"Yeah, yeah. She's seeing this guy, Art Vandelay."
S07E15,SUSAN,So what does he do?
S07E15,GEORGE,He's an importer-exporter.
S07E15,SUSAN,What kind of problems are they having?
S07E15,GEORGE,"(not happy delivering Elaine's lie) Well, he uh, he wants to uh, quit the exporting and uh, focus just on the importing. And it's a problem, because she thinks the exporting is as important as the importing."
S07E15,SUSAN,Are you having an affair with Elaine?
S07E15,GEORGE,"(trying to laugh it off) Right. C'mon! I'm having an affair with Elaine?! If I was having an affair with Elaine, I wouldn't tell you I'm going to see Elaine. I would make up some other person to tell you I was gonna go see, and then I would go see Ela..Elaine."
S07E15,SUSAN,Huh?
S07E15,NICK,(yelling after the fleeing Kramer) I'll get you! I'll get you Kramer! You won't get away with this!
S07E15,MORTY,"Alright, are you ready to eat?"
S07E15,HELEN,"(glancing at her watch) Oh, right, let's go. Jerry, let's go, it's time to eat. We're going to dinner."
S07E15,JERRY,(confused) Dinner? W..What time is it?
S07E15,HELEN,(pulling on a coat) It's four-thirty.
S07E15,JERRY,(bewildered) Four-thirty? Who eats dinner at four-thirty?
S07E15,MORTY,"By the time we sit down, it'll be quarter to five."
S07E15,JERRY,I don't understand why we have to eat now.
S07E15,HELEN,We gotta catch the early-bird. It's only between four-thirty and six.
S07E15,MORTY,"Yeah. They give you a tenderloin, a salad and a baked potato, for four-ninety-five. You know what that cost you after six?"
S07E15,JERRY,"Can't we eat at a decent hour? I'll treat, okay?"
S07E15,HELEN,You're not buying us dinner.
S07E15,JERRY,"(emphatic) I'm not force-feeding myself a steak at four-thirty to save a coupla bucks, I'll tell you that!"
S07E15,HELEN,"Alright, (sitting on the couch) we'll wait. (pointedly) But it's unheard of."
S07E15,GEORGE,"...So, anyway, if you think about it, manure is not really that bad a word. I mean, it's 'newer', which is good, and a 'ma' in front of it, which is also good. Ma-newer , right?"
S07E15,MARISA,(laughing) You're so right. I never thought of it like that. Manure. 'Ma' and the 'newer'.
S07E15,MARISA,Did you just make that up?
S07E15,GEORGE,"What, you think I'm doing material here?"
S07E15,MARISA,"(laughs) No, no. It's hard to believe anyone could be so spontaneously funny."
S07E15,GEORGE,(modest) And I'm a little tired.
S07E15,MARISA,"So, tell me, how is it that a man like you, so bald, and so quirky and funny, how is it you're not taken?"
S07E15,GEORGE,"Well, Marisa. See, the thing is... I'm sort of engaged."
S07E15,MARISA,What?
S07E15,GEORGE,"I'm, you know, engaged."
S07E15,JERRY (V.O),"Hey look, there's a spot right in front."
S07E15,MORTY(V.O.),"Always, Jerry. Always."
S07E15,DORIS,Was that delicious or what?
S07E15,JACK,Where you gonna get a better meal than that?
S07E15,DORIS,Better than Danny's.
S07E15,JACK,Danny's? (scoffs) C'mon!
S07E15,MORTY,Hello Jack.
S07E15,HELEN,Doris.
S07E15,DORIS,"Hello, hello."
S07E15,JERRY,Jack.
S07E15,DORIS,"Hello, Jerry."
S07E15,JERRY,Hi Doris.
S07E15,JACK,"Hello Morty. (looking at watch) Well, missed the early bird."
S07E15,MORTY,"Yeah, so?"
S07E15,JACK,(pointed) Must be nice to have that kind of money.
S07E15,JACK,"Bernie, look who's eating at six o'clock. (pointed) Your suddenly well-to-do president. But, you enjoy your last meal in office. Tomorrow, they kick you out, you'll have plenty of time to drive around in your Cadillac."
S07E15,MORTY,They're not kicking me out. You don't have the votes.
S07E15,JACK,That's what you think.
S07E15,MORTY,We'll see.
S07E15,JACK,"Yes, we will."
S07E15,JERRY,"Awright, let's eat already."
S07E15,ELAINE,"Hi, Susan."
S07E15,SUSAN,Hi.
S07E15,ELAINE,"Hi. Come in, come in. Have a seat."
S07E15,SUSAN,"(standing) Uh, Elaine, I have to ask you a question."
S07E15,ELAINE,"Oh, sure."
S07E15,SUSAN,(dead serious) Are you having an affair with George?
S07E15,ELAINE,"(disbelief) Wha...?! (uncontrolled laughter) Ha ha ha. Ha, no."
S07E15,ELAINE,"(laughter) Don't be ridiculous! (laughter) I mean, why would anyone wanna sleep..."
S07E15,ELAINE,"...Well, obviously... You know... (disbelief) Ap..ap, Chu... Why would you think I was having an affair with George?"
S07E15,SUSAN,"Ohh, because he said that he had to talk with you earlier about some problem that you were having."
S07E15,ELAINE,"(recalling the arranged lie) Yeah, yeah, I did have to talk with him. I definitely had to talk with him. Having a problem with my boyfriend."
S07E15,SUSAN,Art Vandelay?
S07E15,ELAINE,"Yeah, Art Vandelay."
S07E15,SUSAN,I'm sorry. (laughing it off) I feel like an idiot.
S07E15,ELAINE,"(smiling) No, no. (laughing) Huh-hu-hu. It's okay."
S07E15,SUSAN,"Oh, just forget that we ever talked. Okay?"
S07E15,ELAINE,It is so forgotten.
S07E15,SUSAN,Alright.
S07E15,ELAINE,"Okay. (relieved) Okay, no problem."
S07E15,SUSAN,"So, was George helpful at all?"
S07E15,ELAINE,"(unconvincing) Yeah. Oh, yes, yes, he was very helpful. (hesitant) Uhm, because, you know, Art and I were getting into this whole thing about his business. Uhm, you know he's an importer-exporter."
S07E15,SUSAN,(not convinced) Yeah.
S07E15,ELAINE,"(explaining, with gestures) Uhm, George felt that I was too adamant in my stand that Art should focus on the exporting and forget about the importing."
S07E15,SUSAN,(spotting an inconsistency) Wait a minute. I thought that Art wanted to give up the exporting.
S07E15,ELAINE,What'd I say?
S07E15,SUSAN,The importing.
S07E15,ELAINE,(caught out) I did. Uh...
S07E15,SUSAN,"So, what does he uh, import?"
S07E15,ELAINE,(extemporising) Uh... chips.
S07E15,SUSAN,Oh. What kinda chips?
S07E15,ELAINE,Potato.
S07E15,SUSAN,Ah.
S07E15,ELAINE,(embroidering) Some corn.
S07E15,SUSAN,And what does he export?
S07E15,ELAINE,Diapers.
S07E15,SUSAN,(fake smile) I'm sorry for bothering you.
S07E15,ELAINE,"Oh, no, it's okay."
S07E15,ELAINE,Okay.
S07E15,ELAINE,"(to herself) C'mon, George, pick up. Oh, pick up. Oh, pick up."
S07E15,GEORGE,Hi.
S07E15,SUSAN,"Hi. (pointedly) So, George, what does Art Vandelay import?"
S07E15,GEORGE,Matches? Long matches.
S07E15,HERB,"...There she is. Okay, if I can have your attention for a minute here. We're calling this emergency meeting of the board of phase two, to consider a motion of impeachment of our president, (indicating) Morty Seinfeld."
S07E15,MORTY,"Nervous, Jack?"
S07E15,JACK,What for?
S07E15,MORTY,Because I have the votes.
S07E15,MORTY,"Nice to see you, Mrs Choate."
S07E15,MRS. CHOATE,"Hello, Morty."
S07E15,HERB,"Building A. Are you for, or against, the motion to impeach?"
S07E15,RALPH,What does that mean?
S07E15,HERB,"It means, if you're for the motion, you're against Morty."
S07E15,RALPH,So why don't you say that?
S07E15,HERB,"Hey, I'm running the meeting."
S07E15,RALPH,If you think so.
S07E15,HERB,Building A?
S07E15,BUILDING A,For impeachment.
S07E15,HERB,Building B?
S07E15,BUILDING B,Against impeachment.
S07E15,HERB,Building C?
S07E15,BUILDING C,For impeachment.
S07E15,HERB,Building D?
S07E15,MRS. CHOATE,Against impeachment.
S07E15,JACK,(a whisper to Morty) I can't believe you got that old bag.
S07E15,MRS. CHOATE,Help! Someone help!
S07E15,JERRY,"Shut up, you old bag!"
S07E15,MRS. CHOATE,"(after Jerry) Oh, thief! Thief!"
S07E15,MRS. CHOATE,It's him. (pointing at Morty) It's your son. Now I know where I saw him. He stole my marble rye.
S07E15,MORTY,My son never stole anything. He's a good boy.
S07E15,RALPH,They should lock him up.
S07E15,MRS. CHOATE,"(pointing at Morty) Like father, like son. (thumps table) I change my vote. I vote to impeach!"
S07E15,BUILDING B,Me too. I change my vote.
S07E15,HERB,"All those in favour, say aye."
S07E15,ALL (EXCEPT MORTY),Aye.
S07E15,HERB,All opposed.
S07E15,HERB,The ayes have it. The motion passes.
S07E15,HERB,"Morty Seinfeld, you are officially dismissed as condo president. As vice-president, Jack Klompus, in accordance with the phase two constitution, is hereby installed as president."
S07E15,HERB,"Hear, hear, Jack."
S07E15,NICK,"(weary) Alright, I know you're in there. I know you can hear me. You win, okay? You win. I can't do it any more. What d'you want from me? Apology? Alright, I'm sorry. There, I said it, I'm sorry, I'm sorry. I see now how we made you feel when we made you sit home waiting. I dunno why we do it. (upset) I guess maybe we just kind of enjoy taking advantage of people. (reasonable) Well, that's gonna change. From now on, no more 'nine to twelve', no more 'one to five'. We're gonna have appointments. Eleven o'clock is gonna mean eleven o'clock. And, if we can't make it, we're gonna call you, tell you why. (worked up) For god's sakes, if a doctor can do it, why can't we? (almost sobbing) Anyway, that's it."
S07E15,JERRY,"The bags are in the car, I guess we better go."
S07E16,ELAINE,"Mr. Peterman sent me over here for a physical because as you may or may not know, he and I are going on a trip to Kenya. Africa. My first such mission for the company. The Massai bushmen wear these great sandals and we're gonna knock them off. Not the Massai, the sandals."
S07E16,DOCTOR,I'll need a urine sample.
S07E16,ELAINE,Right.
S07E16,GEORGE,You know how hot it gets there? Like 150 degrees. Your skin is gonna be simmering with boils.
S07E16,ELAINE,"Oh, Come on."
S07E16,JERRY,"Hey George, you coming to the Tonight Show on Thursday?"
S07E16,GEORGE,"Hey, yeah. My parents want to come too, is that ok?"
S07E16,JERRY,"Yeah, sure. My parents will be there."
S07E16,ELAINE,The Tonight Show?
S07E16,JERRY,"Yeah, they're in town this week, you wanna go?"
S07E16,ELAINE,Are you doing new material?
S07E16,JERRY,No.
S07E16,ELAINE,I don't think so.
S07E16,KRAMER,Hey. Super's in my bathroom changing my shower head. Have they changed your shower head?
S07E16,JERRY,"No, he's doing mine next. They're low flow you know."
S07E16,KRAMER,Low flow? Well I don't like the sound of that.
S07E16,ELAINE,So what are your parents doing here in new York?
S07E16,JERRY,"Well, they were humiliated. I mean after the impeachment, my father left office in disgrace."
S07E16,ELAINE,So what are their plans?
S07E16,JERRY,"Well, this is the problem. They're moving into this new development. Here's the pamphlet. Del Boca Vista. But they're not quite ready to go back so they're in seclusion here for a while at Uncle Leo's."
S07E16,ELAINE,You mean the three of them in that tiny apartment?
S07E16,JERRY,"No, Leo's not there. He's got a girlfriend, Lydia. In fact, he moved in with her."
S07E16,GEORGE,Uncle Leo's having regular sex?
S07E16,JERRY,"Yeah, I know. It devalues the whole thing."
S07E16,JERRY,(answering phone) Hello?
S07E16,MORTY,"Jerry, what time do we have to be at the the Tonight Show on Thursday."
S07E16,JERRY,You gotta be there at 430.
S07E16,MORTY,But it comes on 1130.
S07E16,JERRY,"Yeah, well they tape it in the afternoon and then they air it at 1130."
S07E16,MORTY,How long they been doing this?
S07E16,JERRY,30 years.
S07E16,MORTY,"Helen, did you know that they tape this thing in the afternoon?"
S07E16,JERRY,"All right, I'll see you later."
S07E16,ELAINE,"Georgie, how come your parents never moved to Florida?"
S07E16,GEORGE,"Yeah, that is odd, isn't it?"
S07E16,JERRY,"Yeah, it is."
S07E16,GEORGE,"I mean, they're retired."
S07E16,JERRY,No economic reason for them to be here.
S07E16,GEORGE,They have no friends.
S07E16,JERRY,No social reason for them to be here.
S07E16,ELAINE,You're all grown up.
S07E16,GEORGE,"Yeah, they're all through ruining my life. What the hell are they still doing here? Lemme see this pamphlet. Hm. All right, so I'll, uh, get back to you."
S07E16,HELEN,Where can I buy some ice? Your father likes a lot of ice.
S07E16,JERRY,"I don't know, maybe get an ice tray?"
S07E16,HELEN,I can do that.
S07E16,JERRY,You know Dad just called me.
S07E16,HELEN,"Yeah, I know. His phlebitis is acting up."
S07E16,JERRY,"Yeah, all right, well I got some people here."
S07E16,HELEN,Ok.
S07E16,JERRY,"All right, bye. (to Elaine) You see this? Any thought pops into their head they're calling me because it's a local call now."
S07E16,ELAINE,Ahh.
S07E16,JERRY,"I'm used to a 1200 mile buffer zone. I can't handle this. Plus I got the dinners, I got the pop ins. They pop in! It's brutal!"
S07E16,ELAINE,They have no idea when they're going back to Florida?
S07E16,JERRY,The only way out of this is if Leo breaks up with his girlfriend and has to move back into the apartment and then they would have to go back to Florida.
S07E16,ELAINE,How's that gonna happen?
S07E16,UNCLE LEO,It's about time you called your uncle. We've got to do this once a week.
S07E16,JERRY,(to himself) Once a week? (to Uncle Leo) So how's Lydia?
S07E16,UNCLE LEO,"Ah, she's a real tiger."
S07E16,JERRY,I don't know how you do it.
S07E16,UNCLE LEO,What?
S07E16,JERRY,"A man like you, limiting yourself to one woman, I don't know. But it's none of my business."
S07E16,UNCLE LEO,What are you talking about?
S07E16,JERRY,Well...
S07E16,UNCLE LEO,"Look at this, I told them medium rare, it's medium."
S07E16,JERRY,"Hey, it happens."
S07E16,UNCLE LEO,I bet that cook is an anti-Semite.
S07E16,JERRY,He has no idea who you are.
S07E16,UNCLE LEO,"They don't just overcook a hamburger, Jerry."
S07E16,JERRY,"All right. Anyway, the point I was making before Goerbbles made your hamburger is a man like you could be dating women twenty years younger. C'mon Uncle Leo, I've seen the way women look at you. When's the last time you looked in a mirror? You're an Adonis! You've got beautiful features, lovely skin, you're in the prime of your life here, you should be swinging. If I were you I'd tell this Lydia character, ""It's been real,"" move back into that bachelor pad and put out a sign; Open for business."
S07E16,UNCLE LEO,"Believe me, I thought about it. But she is so perfect in every way, I can't see a flaw."
S07E16,JERRY,"Well, keep looking."
S07E16,PETERMAN,"I'm afraid I have some bad news, Elaine. It appears you will not be accompanying me to Africa."
S07E16,ELAINE,What? Why not?
S07E16,PETERMAN,"I'm afraid it's your urine, Elaine. You tested positive for opium."
S07E16,ELAINE,Opium?
S07E16,PETERMAN,"That's right, Elaine. White lotus. Yam-yam. Shanghai Sally."
S07E16,ELAINE,"Ihat's impossible, I've never done a drug in my life. Dr. Strugatz must have made a mistake."
S07E16,PETERMAN,"Not a chance. I'm afraid I'll just have to find someone else to accompany me on my journey. The dark continent is no place for an addict, Elaine."
S07E16,ELAINE,"Obviously, Mr. Peterman, there's something wrong with this test. I don't take opium. Let me take another one, please? I'll call the doctor right now, I'll take a pop urine test."
S07E16,PETERMAN,"All right, Elaine."
S07E16,ELAINE,"Oh, thank you Mr. Peterman. (Drinks a glass of water) I'll be ready in three minutes."
S07E16,GEORGE,"Whew! Boy, it's cold outside, huh? Oh, these New York winters, huh. Bitter cold, bitter."
S07E16,FRANK,"I was out for five minutes before, I couldn't feel my extremities."
S07E16,ESTELLE,What extremities?
S07E16,GEORGE,"You know what the temperature in Florida is today? Eh? Seventy-nine. That's almost eighty. Yeah, I read someplace the life expectancy in Florida is eighty-one and in Queens, seventy-three."
S07E16,ESTELLE,"So George, why are you here?"
S07E16,GEORGE,"What, I can't stop by and visit my parents? (Drops pamphlet on coffee table)"
S07E16,ESTELLE,What's this.
S07E16,GEORGE,"That's where the Seinfeld's are moving. They got a great deal. Yep. You know what they got in Florida? Jai-Alai! You bet on the games, you clean up."
S07E16,ESTELLE,I don't bet.
S07E16,GEORGE,What about the dolphins? You could swim with the dolphins down there.
S07E16,ESTELLE,I don't swim.
S07E16,GEORGE,You could pet them. They come right out of the water onto the sidewalks.
S07E16,ESTELLE,Are you trying to get rid of us?
S07E16,GEORGE,"Rid? Nah, c'mon, the word is 'care'. Care. I care about your comfort, be it here in Queens or twelve-hundred miles away."
S07E16,ELAINE,No?
S07E16,KRAMER,Jerry? Jerry!
S07E16,KRAMER,"Wha, you too?"
S07E16,JERRY,Yeah!
S07E16,KRAMER,"These showers are horrible. There's no pressure, I can't get the shampoo out of my hair."
S07E16,JERRY,Me either.
S07E16,KRAMER,If I don't have a good shower I am not myself. I feel weak and ineffectual. I'm not Kramer.
S07E16,JERRY,You? What about me? I got the Tonight Show tonight. I'm gonna have to shower in the dressing room.
S07E16,KRAMER,(leaving) Aw.
S07E16,JERRY,Where are you going?
S07E16,KRAMER,I gotta find another shower.
S07E16,KRAMER,They got you too?
S07E16,NEWMAN,This stuff is awful! I'm not Newman!
S07E16,KRAMER,"Oh, Elaine. Yeah."
S07E16,ELAINE,"Kramer, you look terrible."
S07E16,KRAMER,"Look, I need the keys to your apartment, I gotta take a shower."
S07E16,ELAINE,What's wrong with your shower?
S07E16,KRAMER,There's no water pressure.
S07E16,ELAINE,Why don't you just go see Jerry?
S07E16,KRAMER,"Jerry's got nothing. Newman's got nothing. You're the only one I know who's got the good stuff, and I need it bad, baby, cause I feel like I got bugs crawling up my skin. Now you gotta help me out."
S07E16,PETERMAN,(busting in) Not on my watch! (Grabs Kramer by the collar) I won't have you turning my office into a den of iniquity! Get your fix somewhere else!
S07E16,ELAINE,Mr Peterman! What are you doing?
S07E16,PETERMAN,"Elaine, you're out of control. You need help."
S07E16,ELAINE,Huh?
S07E16,PETERMAN,"I know what you're going through. I too once fell under the spell of opium. It was 1979. I was travelling the Yangtzee in search of a Mongolian horsehair vest. I had got to the market after sundown, all of the clothing traders had gone, but a different sort of trader still lurked about. ""Just a taste,"" he said. That was all it took."
S07E16,ELAINE,"Mr. Peterman, I don't know what's going on here. I am not addicted to anything."
S07E16,PETERMAN,"Oh, Elaine. The toll road of denial is a long and dangerous one. The price? Your soul. Oh, and by the way, you have til' 500 to clear out your desk. You're fired."
S07E16,HELEN,All they serve is chicken?
S07E16,JERRY,There's more food down the hall.
S07E16,MORTY,"Wrap it up, we'll take it home."
S07E16,JERRY,"Oh, hi."
S07E16,ESTELLE,Hello Seinfelds.
S07E16,MORTY,Hello.
S07E16,HELEN,Hi.
S07E16,FRANK,This is your dressing room? They treat you like Toscanini.
S07E16,ESTELLE,"Oh, Jerry. I don't know how you could do this. I'm so nervous for you."
S07E16,JERRY,"Actually, I'm drunk."
S07E16,GEORGE,"Hey, hey, how was Florida?"
S07E16,MORTY,"Well, we just bought a new place down there."
S07E16,ESTELLE,"I know, we were looking at the brochure."
S07E16,MORTY,What?
S07E16,HELEN,"Why, you thinking of moving?"
S07E16,FRANK,Not really.
S07E16,MORTY,"Because if you are, you shouldn't. There's nothing available in that development."
S07E16,FRANK,Are you telling me there's not one condo available in all of Del Boca Vista?
S07E16,MORTY,That's right. They went like hotcakes.
S07E16,FRANK,How'd you get yours?
S07E16,MORTY,Got lucky.
S07E16,FRANK,Are you trying to keep us out of Del Boca Vista?!
S07E16,JERRY,"I know this doesn't seem like work to any of you, if you could perhaps conduct your psychopath convention down the hall, I could just get a little personal space."
S07E16,ELAINE,"How could I have tested positive twice? Once I could understand, that's a mistake. But twice?"
S07E16,WAITRESS,"Yeah, it's hard to figure."
S07E16,ELAINE,"I mean I lost my job, I can't go to Africa. I was gonna meet the bush-men of the Kalahari."
S07E16,WAITRESS,"Ah, the bush-men?"
S07E16,ELAINE,And the bush-women.
S07E16,MAN,(also seated at the counter) Excuse me. I couldn't help overhearing. I notice you're eating a poppy seed muffin.
S07E16,ELAINE,"Yeah, I eat these muffins all the time."
S07E16,MAN,"Well, you know what opium is made from..."
S07E16,ELAINE,(as though receiving a revelation) Poppies!
S07E16,JAY LENO,"Welcome back. Talking with Jerry Seinfeld. Jerry, lemme ask you, I saw some people back there, they look like.. family? Is that family?"
S07E16,JERRY,"Yeah, I got some family backstage. Course my family's nuts; they're crazy. Yep. My uncle Leo, (quick take of Uncle Leo in bet with Lydia, watching Jerry on TV. Lydia is laughing, Leo is not) I had lunch with him the other day, he's one of these guys that anything goes wrong in life, he blames it on anti-Semitism. You know what I mean, the spaghetti's not al dente? Cook's an anti-Semite. Loses a bet on a horse. Secretariat? Anti-Semitic. Doesn't get a good seat at the temple. Rabbi? Anti-Semite."
S07E16,JERRY,"Hey, listen to this, Uncle Leo broke up with his girlfriend because of the bit I did. She thought it was funny, so he accused *her* of being an anti-Semite. They had a huge fight and now he's moving back into his apartment. You know what this means, my parents are gonna go back to Florida... What? What number is this? Oh, I'm terribly sorry."
S07E16,JERRY,"Hey Kramer, my parents are gonna have to move back to Florida, isn't that great?"
S07E16,KRAMER,"(halfheartedly) Yeah, well I'm really happy for ya."
S07E16,JERRY,"Hey, you're not giving it to me, man. What's wrong?"
S07E16,KRAMER,"I just took a bath, Jerry. A bath?"
S07E16,JERRY,No good?
S07E16,KRAMER,It's disgusting. I'm sitting there in a tepid pool of my own filth. All kinds of microscopic parasites and organisms having sex all around me.
S07E16,JERRY,"Well, you used to sit in that hot tub?"
S07E16,KRAMER,"Jerry, that was superheated water, nothing could live in that."
S07E16,JERRY,(offering a plate) Chicken?
S07E16,KRAMER,"Oh, yeah."
S07E16,ELAINE,"Well, this you're not gonna believe. I found out why I was testing positive for opium. Poppy seeds!"
S07E16,JERRY,Poppy seeds!
S07E16,KRAMER,"Well, that makes sense. (Offers plate to Elaine) Want some chicken?"
S07E16,ELAINE,"Yeah. Thanks. So, I'm gonna get tested again later, hopefully I'll get my job back and I will be on my way to Africa."
S07E16,JERRY,Hello Newman.
S07E16,NEWMAN,"Hello Jerry. Well, I may have a solution to our little problem. Elaine, would you excuse us?"
S07E16,ELAINE,"Oh c'mon, Newman."
S07E16,NEWMAN,I have a private matter to discuss with my fellow tenants. (Opens door) If you don't mind?
S07E16,ELAINE,Jerry?
S07E16,NEWMAN,"Look, sister, go get yourself a cup of coffee, all right? Beat it! (Pushes Elaine out the door and closes it) All right, now here's the lowdown. From a certain connection, I've been able to locate some black market shower heads. They're all made in the former Yugoslavia, and from what I hear the Serbs are fanatic about their showers."
S07E16,JERRY,Not from the footage I've seen.
S07E16,NEWMAN,"Nevertheless, sometime this afternoon, behind the Market Diner, an unmarked van will be waiting. I'm expecting the call at any time. Are you in?"
S07E16,KRAMER,I'm down.
S07E16,NEWMAN,Jerry?
S07E16,ESTELLE,"So, Georgie, we have some big news for you."
S07E16,GEORGE,Big news?
S07E16,ESTELLE,We're moving to Florida.
S07E16,GEORGE,"(ecstatic) What? You're moving to Florida!?! That's wonderful! I'm so happy! (pause) For you! I'm so happy for you! Oh, what do you need this cold weather for?"
S07E16,FRANK,"Has nothing to do with the weather, it's because of the Seinfelds."
S07E16,GEORGE,What do you mean?
S07E16,FRANK,"They don't want us there, so we're going. We're moving right into Del Boca Vista!"
S07E16,GEORGE,So you're moving there for spite!
S07E16,FRANK,Absolutely. No one tells Frank Costanza what to do!
S07E16,GEORGE,"That's right, who the hell are they? How dare they?!"
S07E16,ESTELLE,"So, Georgie, are you gonna come to visit us?"
S07E16,GEORGE,"Oh, every chance I get."
S07E16,ESTELLE,(warmly) Ohhh.
S07E16,GEORGE,Jerry? Jerry! I'm busting! I'm busting!
S07E16,JERRY,What's going on?
S07E16,GEORGE,My parents are moving to Florida!
S07E16,JERRY,Are you kidding?
S07E16,GEORGE,Can you believe it? It's happening! It's finally happening! I'm free!!
S07E16,JERRY,Where are they moving to?
S07E16,GEORGE,Del Boca Vista!
S07E16,JERRY,"Del Boca Vista, that's where my parents are gonna live!"
S07E16,GEORGE,I know!
S07E16,JERRY,We could visit together!
S07E16,GEORGE,Every five years!
S07E16,JERRY,That's incredible!
S07E16,GEORGE,"I know, I know and you know *why* they're moving there?"
S07E16,JERRY,Why?
S07E16,GEORGE,To spite your parents!
S07E16,JERRY,To spite my parents?
S07E16,GEORGE,Yeah!
S07E16,JERRY,Your parents are crazy!
S07E16,GEORGE,"I know, they're out of their minds! It's fantastic!"
S07E16,JERRY,My parents are moving back too!
S07E16,GEORGE,Beautiful!
S07E16,MORTY,I'm sorry Leo's moving back here. I'm not ready to go back to Florida.
S07E16,HELEN,"He was getting along so well with that woman, what happened?"
S07E16,MORTY,Hello?
S07E16,VOICE,This is Frank Costanza.
S07E16,MORTY,What do you want?
S07E16,FRANK,"You think you could keep us out of Florida? We're moving in lock, stock and barrel. We're gonna be in the pool. We're gonna be in the clubhouse. We're gonna be all over that shuffleboard court! And I dare you to keep me out!"
S07E16,MORTY,"I'm sorry, we can't go back to Florida."
S07E16,GEORGE,I can't believe I didn't push for this sooner.
S07E16,JERRY,You have no idea how your life is gonna improve as a result of this. Food tastes better. The air seems fresher. You'll have more energy and self confidence than you ever dreamed of.
S07E16,JERRY,Hello.
S07E16,MORTY,"Hello, Jerry? It's your father."
S07E16,JERRY,"Oh, hi dad."
S07E16,MORTY,"Listen, is it all right if we move in with you for a little while? Sounds of breaking glass, Jerry dropped his bottle."
S07E16,MORTY,What was that?
S07E16,JERRY,"Nothing. A bottle broke. That's all. What do you mean, you're gonna move in here?"
S07E16,MORTY,Because the Costanzas are moving into Del Boca Vista.
S07E16,JERRY,But it's a big complex.
S07E16,MORTY,"You don't understand, you gotta have a buffer zone."
S07E16,JERRY,"All right, fine. Come over here. (Hangs up phone)"
S07E16,GEORGE,What?
S07E16,JERRY,They're not going back to Florida. They're moving here.
S07E16,GEORGE,What? Why?
S07E16,JERRY,Because your parents are going down there. My buffer zone just went from twelve hundred miles down to two feet! You gotta do something.
S07E16,GEORGE,"Hey, I'm sorry, you had your buffer zone for many years. It's my turn to live, baby."
S07E16,JERRY,"You know what you're doing, don't you? You're killing Independent Jerry! I gotta go see my Uncle Leo. I think he may have made a big mistake."
S07E16,UNCLE LEO,Move back with Lydia?
S07E16,JERRY,"C'mon, you're lucky to have anybody."
S07E16,UNCLE LEO,"Last week you told me I was in my prime, I should be swinging."
S07E16,JERRY,"Swinging? What are you, out of your mind? Look at you, you're disgusting. You're bald, you're paunchy, all kinds of sounds are emanating from your body twenty-four hours a day. If there's a woman that can take your presence for more than ten consecutive seconds, you should hang on to her like grim death. Which is not far off, by the way."
S07E16,UNCLE LEO,But she's an anti-Semite.
S07E16,JERRY,Can you blame her?
S07E16,HELEN,"You don't think he minds us staying here, do you?"
S07E16,MORTY,Why would he mind? We're his parents.
S07E16,ELAINE,Oh.
S07E16,HELEN,Hi Elaine.
S07E16,ELAINE,Hello. Jerry's not here?
S07E16,HELEN,No.
S07E16,ELAINE,Huh. (pause) Oh my god.
S07E16,HELEN,What?
S07E16,ELAINE,"A poppy seed! It must have been in the chicken. Oh, I'm dead. I'm going to the doctor's in a half an hour."
S07E16,HELEN,Why?
S07E16,ELAINE,It's a long story.
S07E16,HELEN,"Just a second, I have to go to the bathroom."
S07E16,ELAINE,What are you gonna do in there?
S07E16,HELEN,What am I gonna do in the bathroom?
S07E16,ELAINE,You gotta do me a favor.
S07E16,HELEN,"Elaine, I really--"
S07E16,ELAINE,"Hold on a second. Mrs. Seinfeld, I need your sample."
S07E16,HELEN,You want my urine?
S07E16,ELAINE,I need a clean urine sample from a woman.
S07E16,HELEN,I don't know.
S07E16,ELAINE,"Oh please, Mrs. Seinfeld, please?"
S07E16,HELEN,"Well, what am I gonna do it in?"
S07E16,ELAINE,"Well, one of those glasses."
S07E16,HELEN,Jerry's glasses?
S07E16,ELAINE,"Yeah, he won't mind. C'mon, you're his mom."
S07E16,HELEN,"Oh, I could uh-- Should I use a coffee cup?"
S07E16,ELAINE,"Yeah, a coffee cup's fine."
S07E16,HELEN,Or maybe a juice glass.
S07E16,ELAINE,"Yes, fine, fine, a juice glass is perfect."
S07E16,HELEN,This one is kind of scratched.
S07E16,ELAINE,It doesn't matter.
S07E16,HELEN,Howbout A milk glass.
S07E16,ELAINE,"A milk glass, a juice glass, any glass, just pick a glass."
S07E16,HELEN,Jerry doesn't wash these very well.
S07E16,ELAINE,"Mrs. Seinfeld, pick a glass! Pick a glass, Mrs. Seinfeld!"
S07E16,SALESMAN,"All right, I got everything here. I got the Cyclone F series, Hydra Jet Flow, Stockholm Superstream, you name it."
S07E16,JERRY,What do you recommend?
S07E16,SALESMAN,What are you looking for?
S07E16,KRAMER,"Power, man. Power."
S07E16,NEWMAN,Like Silkwood.
S07E16,KRAMER,That's for radiation.
S07E16,NEWMAN,That's right.
S07E16,KRAMER,"(pointing to the largest one) Now, what is this?"
S07E16,SALESMAN,"That's the Commando 450, I don't sell that one. What about thi-"
S07E16,KRAMER,"Well that's what we want, the Commando 450."
S07E16,SALESMAN,"Nah, believe me. It's only used in the circus. For elephants."
S07E16,NEWMAN,We'll pay anything. We've got the (hands a wad of money to Kramer) What about Jerry?
S07E16,KRAMER,"He couldn't handle that, he's delicate."
S07E16,HELEN,It's nice being back at Leo's Jerry's place was too small.
S07E16,MORTY,"First Leo breaks up, then he goes back. What the hell's going on?"
S07E16,MORTY,Who is it?
S07E16,SUPER,It's the super. We're installing new low-flow showerheads in all the bathrooms.
S07E16,MORTY,Low flow? I don't like the sound of that.
S07E16,PETERMAN,"So as a result of your test being free of opium, I am reinstating you."
S07E16,ELAINE,Oh! Yes! What a load off. So when are we going to Africa?
S07E16,PETERMAN,I'm afraid I can't take you.
S07E16,ELAINE,What? Why not?
S07E16,PETERMAN,"Elaine, according to your urine analysis, you're menopausal. you have the metabolism of a sixty-eight year old woman."
S07E16,ELAINE,But I wanted to see the bushmen.
S07E16,PETERMAN,"Oh, and one more thing. You may have osteoporosis."
S07E16,JERRY,"Well, it's been a great visit."
S07E16,MORTY,"Jerry, I'll tell ya. The first thing I'm gonna do when I get back to Florida is take a shower."
S07E16,JERRY,"Well, at least the Costanzas changed their mind and decided not to move. They couldn't bear being away from George."
S07E16,HELEN,George must be happy about that.
S07E16,JERRY,You have no idea.
S07E16,FRANK,Take my swim trunks. I won't need them.
S07E16,ESTELLE,What does he want with your swim trunks?
S07E16,FRANK,Why should they go to waste?!?
S07E17,[Setting,Night club]
S07E17,JERRY,"Thank you! Goodnight! (Walks off stage, sighing deeply. Instantly, a red-headed woman runs up and hugs him - taking Jerry by surprise)"
S07E17,SALLY,Jerry!
S07E17,JERRY,(Trying to ward her off) Hey. Hey!
S07E17,SALLY,(Reminding him who she is) Sally Weaver! (Sees Jerry's expression - he still has no clue who she is) Susan Ross' roommate from college.. hello! (Laughs slightly)
S07E17,JERRY,"Right.. Oh, I'm sorry. Uh, oh, so you saw the show?"
S07E17,SALLY,Saw it? I loved it! And thank you for the free tickets. You are so funny.
S07E17,JERRY,"(Modest) Oh, thanks."
S07E17,SALLY,"(Serious) No, no, I mean it. You're very funny."
S07E17,JERRY,(Blunt) I believe you.
S07E17,SALLY,"Oh, anyway, let me show you Memphis. I am taking you (Points to him) out to dinner."
S07E17,JERRY,"(Grabbing his coat) Oh, I'm sorry, I can't - I'm going straight to the airport."
S07E17,SALLY,"Ohh.. that's too bad.. Susan thought we'd really get along - I guess because we're both wacko! (Jerry laughs) You know what, um.. (Turns around, picking up a large gift from a table) You have to give this to them for me. Okay? Here. (Hands the box to Jerry, he struggles under the size of it) It's a wedding present."
S07E17,JERRY,Oh?
S07E17,SALLY,"And Jerry? Be careful with it, okay? Be very careful."
S07E17,JERRY,Uh-huh.
S07E17,[Setting,The Coffee shop]
S07E17,FRANK,"George, as you may be aware, your mother and I are not moving to Del Boca Vista, Florida."
S07E17,GEORGE,(Resenting the fact. Nodding) I am aware.
S07E17,FRANK,"So, I was wondering, would it be okay if I turned your room into a billiard parlor?"
S07E17,GEORGE,A billiard parlor?
S07E17,FRANK,"Regulation table, the hi-fi, maybe even a bar.. Give it real authenticity.."
S07E17,GEORGE,"Well, that's.. Elaine!"
S07E17,ELAINE,"Oh, hi, Frank."
S07E17,GEORGE,"(Sliding over to make room for her) Sit down. Join us, please."
S07E17,ELAINE,"(Trying to come up with an excuse not to sit with them) Actually, I gotta get to the.. uh.. thing."
S07E17,GEORGE,"(Somewhat stern) Oh, the thing's cancelled. Sit down."
S07E17,ELAINE,"(Giving up) Okay.. (Sits, George laughs) So.. (Trying to think up something to talk about) Frank, did George ever show you that photo?"
S07E17,GEORGE,(Confused) What photo?
S07E17,ELAINE,"You know, the photo I took in Tuscany of the little man in front of the sign that said ""Costanza""?"
S07E17,FRANK,(Interested) There's a Costanza in Tuscany? (Elaine nods) Did he look like me? Did you talk to him?
S07E17,ELAINE,"I didn't talk to anyone - I was just walking by, and I saw the sign, and I thought George might get a kick out of it."
S07E17,FRANK,"I gotta get that picture - it could be my cousin, Carlo."
S07E17,ELAINE,Who is that?
S07E17,GEORGE,"(Muttering out, not really wanting to talk about his family) When the Costanzas came here, one brother stayed behind."
S07E17,FRANK,I played with him every day until the age of four - and then we separated.
S07E17,ELAINE,"So, you weren't born here?"
S07E17,FRANK,"No. That's why I can never be president.. It always irked me. That's why, even at an early age, I had no interest in politics. I refuse to vote. (Yelling out) They don't want me, I don't want them!"
S07E17,GEORGE,I don't know what you're getting all riled up about. There are probably a million Costanzas-
S07E17,FRANK,(Cutting him off) Don't bring me down. (To Elaine) Do you have another copy of that photo?
S07E17,ELAINE,"No, I, I don't. But.. Well, the Maestro might."
S07E17,FRANK,The Maestro? What Maestro?
S07E17,ELAINE,"He's this guy that I went to Tuscany with. He's a great guy, but I just wouldn't feel comfortable calling him."
S07E17,GEORGE,Really? Why?
S07E17,ELAINE,(Explaining) Because he hasn't called me since we got back.. I spilled wine on his 8 by 10 photo of one of his favorite Italian opera stars.
S07E17,GEORGE,Who?
S07E17,ELAINE,You know the Three Tenors?
S07E17,GEORGE,Yeah.. (Trying to remember) Poverotti.. Domingo.. and.. uh.. the other guy.
S07E17,ELAINE,(Nodding) The other guy.
S07E17,[Setting,Airplane]
S07E17,STEWARDESS,(Overly nice) Could I take that box for you?
S07E17,JERRY,"Uh.. well, you better not. I'm supposed to be careful with it."
S07E17,STEWARDESS,"Oh, then, I'll have to put your bag in the over-head."
S07E17,JERRY,"Oh, okay.."
S07E17,STEWARDESS,There we go.
S07E17,[Setting,Jerry's apartment]
S07E17,JERRY,Ohh.. look at this..
S07E17,KRAMER,What?
S07E17,JERRY,I bought a bottle of BBQ sauce in Memphis. I think the stewardess broke it when she tried to jam it into the overhead compartment because of this
S07E17,KRAMER,"Well, don't press the panic button. I'm sure that we can still salvage some sauce.."
S07E17,JERRY,"I don't care about the sauce. It came in this funny little bottle, and there was a guy on the label that looked exactly like Charles Grodin."
S07E17,KRAMER,(Taking some of Jerry's clothing over to the kitchen) I see..
S07E17,JERRY,"No, you don't see - because I'm going on the show this week, and this was going to be my bit on the show."
S07E17,KRAMER,"Well, why don't you do your material?"
S07E17,JERRY,I'm out.
S07E17,KRAMER,"(Looking up, sighs) Well, you better get to work."
S07E17,JERRY,(Sarcastic) Thanks for the tip.
S07E17,GEORGE,"Hey, buddies."
S07E17,JERRY,"Hey. Hey, this is for you. (Taps the gift) It's from.. uh, Susan's roommate, Sally."
S07E17,GEORGE,Oh yeah.. (Starts to open it) Sally called Susan - said you guys really hit it off.
S07E17,JERRY,"(Annoyed at the thought) Nobody hit anything off. She just gave me the box. (Looks over at Kramer. He is scraping the BBQ sauce off Jerry's clothes with a knife, then dipping some bread into it) What the hell are you doing?"
S07E17,KRAMER,(Looks up) I'm salvaging the sauce. What's the matter with you? (Eats the bread)
S07E17,JERRY,"(Pleading) Hey, hey, hey. Come on, come on."
S07E17,KRAMER,"(Moving out into the living room) Jerry, why don't you do a bit on Styrofoam?"
S07E17,JERRY,Like what?
S07E17,KRAMER,"Well, uh.. (Starts to impersonate Jerry's act) ""What is this stuff? Why do we need this stuff?.. And why do they make it so small..?"""
S07E17,JERRY,(Confused) Where's the punchline?
S07E17,KRAMER,It's all attitude.. (Makes a humorous face - mocking Jerry's)
S07E17,GOERGE,"(Taking out a mat from the huge box) Well, this is certainly a crappy gift.."
S07E17,JERRY,A door mat? That's what she had me lug up from Memphis?!
S07E17,GEORGE,"Pretty chintzy, huh? Considering the money she makes.. She's a big executive for Federal Express."
S07E17,JERRY,Federal Express?! Is she out of her mind? Why didn't she just ship it?!
S07E17,KRAMER,"Look, it's personalized. (Holds it up, reading) ""The Costanzas"""
S07E17,GEORGE,"No, no. Forget it. I don't want it. Let's just get rid of it."
S07E17,KRAMER,"Well, maybe your father would be interested in that."
S07E17,GEORGE,I doubt it. You know what he's doing now? He's putting a pool table in my old bedroom.
S07E17,KRAMER,"(Interested) Oh yeah? Well, maybe I'll go out there and knock a few balls around with him. You know, show him a thing or two.."
S07E17,[Setting,George's old bedroom]
S07E17,KRAMER,"So, what's your game? What do you like to play?"
S07E17,FRANK,Eight ball.
S07E17,KRAMER,"No, nothing doing. Let's, you and me, play a game of straight pool.. hmm?"
S07E17,FRANK,"You like to gamble, Cosmo?"
S07E17,KRAMER,"Yeah, now and then - you know how it is.."
S07E17,FRANK,"Five dollars a game, huh?"
S07E17,KRAMER,I'll break.
S07E17,FRANK,Okay.
S07E17,[Setting,George and Susan's apartment]
S07E17,GEORGE,What's all this?
S07E17,SUSAN,"Oh, I'm just moving in some more of my stuff."
S07E17,GEORGE,(Muttering to himself as he walks to the bedroom) More stuff..
S07E17,SUSAN,"(Calling out) Oh, I put up my doll collection.."
S07E17,GEORGE,Oh my God! What is that?!
S07E17,SUSAN,(Rushing in) What? What is it?
S07E17,GEORGE,(Staring at the doll) This doll (Pointing) looks like my mother.
S07E17,SUSAN,"George, it's a doll."
S07E17,GEORGE,"I know it's a doll, but it looks like my mother!"
S07E17,SUSAN,"(Going back to the living room) Oh, get outta here.."
S07E17,[Setting,George's old bedroom]
S07E17,ESTELLE,"What's going on in here? (Kramer hits the cue ball, it jumps up from the table and flies off screen) Are you two still playing?! You've been up here three hours!"
S07E17,FRANK,We still haven't finished the first game.
S07E17,ESTELLE,The first game?!
S07E17,KRAMER,"(Explaining why they are doing so bad) Well, we're still, uh, learning the subtleties of the table."
S07E17,FRANK,(To Estelle) he knows the Maestro. He could have the picture..
S07E17,ESTELLE,"Oh, forget about it. It's not your cousin."
S07E17,FRANK,"(Yelling out) You don't know that! (Estelle leaves, slamming the door) We're gonna go see him, huh?"
S07E17,KRAMER,(Judging up his next move) As soon as the game is over..
S07E17,FRANK,(Sensing the game is going to last a long time) Oh boy.
S07E17,KRAMER,"Eleven, corner pocket. (Pulls back on his stick, accidentally crashing it into the window)"

S07E17,ELAINE,Who else is on the show?
S07E17,JERRY,Uh.. one of the three tenors.
S07E17,ELAINE,(Interested) The Three Tenors? (Stands up) Which one?!
S07E17,JERRY,Uh.. It's not Poverotti.. It's not Domingo..
S07E17,ELAINE,(Extremely excited) The other guy?!
S07E17,JERRY,"(Nodding) Yeah, the other guy."
S07E17,ELAINE,(Screams out in joy) My God! I can't believe the other guy's going to be on the show!
S07E17,JERRY,Why?
S07E17,ELAINE,Because I ruined this autographed picture of him that belonged to the Maestro. You think I can go and get his autograph?
S07E17,JERRY,Why not?
S07E17,ELAINE,(Extremely giddy) Wow! The other guy!
S07E17,JERRY,"Hey, you look awful."

S07E17,GEORGE,(Muttering) Susan has the doll collection.. one of the dolls looks exactly like my mother.. she likes to sleep with it.
S07E17,JERRY,Wow. You were in bed with your mother last night?
S07E17,GEORGE,"(Long pause) ..Felt like it. I tell you, this doll is pretty spooky. (Takes off his glasses, rubbing his eye) It's freakin' me out man. And now I got to go back out there and pick up this doormat."
S07E17,JERRY,I thought you didn't want the doormat.
S07E17,GEORGE,I don't. Susan wants to have it out when Sally comes tomorrow.
S07E17,JERRY,"Sally? (Getting upset) Wait, wait a minute - She's coming to New York?"
S07E17,GEORGE,"Yeah, (Smiling) Susan said you'd be excited."
S07E17,JERRY,Excited? I'm gonna kill her! She knew she was coming here and she made me carry that box?!
S07E17,ELAINE,Who's Sally?
S07E17,GEORGE,Susan's college roommate.
S07E17,JERRY,It's because of her that bottle got broke that I was going to give to Charles Grodin on his show.
S07E17,GEORGE,So call her up and tell her to bring you another one. She'll be delighted to talk to you.
S07E17,JERRY,"(While opening a cereal box) I will - don't worry. (Plotting revenge) In fact, I'll have her bring up a whole case of the stuff. It'll be really heavy. Let's see if she likes sitting on a plane with a big box on her lap!"
S07E17,ELAINE,That's sounds pretty juvenile.
S07E17,JERRY,"(Pulling out the toy from the cereal box - he displays even more immaturity by holding it up, smiling) Hey! A dinosaur!"

S07E17,FRANK,"His name was Carlo Costanza. We played together everyday until I was four. If I could just look through your photographs, maybe I could recognize him."
S07E17,MAESTRO,Unfortunately those photographs are at home.
S07E17,KRAMER,"Well, listen, if you bring 'em by, maybe we could interest you in a game of pool.. Yeah, Frank here - he's got his own billiard room."
S07E17,FRANK,"(Trying to concentrate) Yes, It's, uh, it's.. uh, uh.. What do you call it, Kramer?"
S07E17,KRAMER,A billiard room.
S07E17,FRANK,"No, not billiard.. (Scolding) Not billiards.. it was.. Come on, already. Come on.."
S07E17,KRAMER,(Confused) What?
S07E17,FRANK,"We call it.. the, uh.."
S07E17,KRAMER,(Snaps) The Place To Be!
S07E17,FRANK,The place to be! Yes! It's the place to be.
S07E17,MAESTRO,"(Agreeing to a game) Ah, then I shall be there. And now, Gentlemen, (Making dramatic actions) if you will excuse me - I must prepare for the symphony."
S07E17,KRAMER,"Oh, yeah?"
S07E17,MAESTRO,"(Noticing the expressions) Ohh, my pants. (Begins putting on a near-by pair of pants) It's an old conductor's trick I learned from Leonard Bernstein."
S07E17,KRAMER,Really?
S07E17,MAESTRO,You keep a perfect crease by not sitting in them before the performance.
S07E17,KRAMER,That's good thinking.
S07E17,[Setting,Jerry's apartment]
S07E17,GEORGE,You see?.. You see?!
S07E17,JERRY,"Well, it doesn't look exactly like her."
S07E17,GEORGE,"Jerry, come on. If my mother keeps shrinking, this is exactly what she's gonna look like in ten years!"
S07E17,JERRY,Why don't you just get rid of it?
S07E17,GEORGE,"I tried! I almost threw it down the incinerator, but I couldn't do it. The guilt was too overwhelming. (Grabs the doll, opening the door to leave) Susan's so attached to this thing."
S07E17,JERRY,"Wait, where are you going? Don't take your dolly and go home."
S07E17,GEORGE,"Hi, Elaine."
S07E17,ELAINE,Did you see that?!
S07E17,JERRY,I'm just glad it's outta here. (Elaine exhales deeply - getting over the scare of the doll. She moves into the apartment) What's that? (Pointing to a rolled up poster Elaine is carrying)
S07E17,ELAINE,"Oh, it's a poster of the three tenors."
S07E17,JERRY,"Oh. (Intercom buzzes, Jerry answers it) Yeah?"
S07E17,SALLY,(Through the intercom) It's Sally.
S07E17,JERRY,"Oh, did you bring the bar-b-que sauce?"
S07E17,SALLY,A whole case.
S07E17,JERRY,"(Letting her up) Excellent. (To Elaine) So, did you buy that electric toothbrush I was telling you about?"
S07E17,ELAINE,"(Blunt, to the point) No."
S07E17,JERRY,How come? I told you - It's fantastic.
S07E17,ELAINE,"Eh, I like mine."
S07E17,JERRY,"I've had yours, I'm telling you - this one is ten times better. Don't you believe me?"
S07E17,ELAINE,I don't want it.
S07E17,JERRY,(Slightly confused by her behavior) I don't understand this. Why wouldn't you want to get something that's better if I'm telling you it's better? And it's not a little better - it's much better.
S07E17,ELAINE,(Not committing to the conversation) It doesn't matter to me.
S07E17,JERRY,Come in.
S07E17,SALLY,"(Peppy) Well, here I am!"
S07E17,JERRY,"Oh, hi. Elaine, this is Sally."
S07E17,ELAINE,Hi.
S07E17,JERRY,How was your flight? (Wishful thinking) Pretty uncomfortable?
S07E17,SALLY,"(Setting the box down on his table) Actually, the seat next to me was empty, so, there was no problem at all."
S07E17,JERRY,"(Let down) Oh.. (Starts to open the box) Oh, wait.. (Holding up one of the BBQ jars) This isn't the sauce that I asked for!"
S07E17,SALLY,"That's right. It's a special gourmet sauce. ""The Pride of Memphis!"""
S07E17,JERRY,"(Complaining) No, no. I wanted the one in the little bottle with that guy on it that looks like Charles Grodin!"
S07E17,SALLY,"This is much better. And frankly, in Memphis, we think that other sauce as (Whispering) kind of a joke."
S07E17,JERRY,I know it's a joke. It's supposed to be a joke! Now I'm going on the Charles Grodin Show with nothing. (Sets the jar down angrily) Nothing!
S07E17,SALLY,You could just do your material.
S07E17,JERRY,(Peeved) I don't have any material!
S07E17,ELAINE,(Yelling out) He's got nothin'!
S07E17,[Setting,The Coffee Shop]
S07E17,DOLL,Georgie! Don't eat with your hands! (George starts eating faster) Why do you eat so fast?! You can't even taste it!
S07E17,GEORGE,(Losing it) Don't tell me how to eat!
S07E17,DOLL,You're wearing that shirt? You've had it for five years already! Why don't you get a new shirt?!
S07E17,GEORGE,"(Trying to keep it down) Because I like this one! (Notices people staring at him, he quickly gets up, collecting the his coat and the tiny replica) C'mon, let's go. Let's go! (On his way out, he stops in front of a woman blocking his path) Oh, hi.. (Embarrassed about the doll, he sheepishly walks out)"

S07E17,FRANK,It's him! (Standing up) It's Carlo Costanza!
S07E17,KRAMER,Come on. Are you sure?
S07E17,FRANK,I'd know him anywhere.
S07E17,MAESTRO,I've seen that man in Tuscany. Eccentric fellow. Reputation of being kind of a village idiot.
S07E17,FRANK,I still say we're related.
S07E17,MAESTRO,"(Recognizing the currently playing song) Ohh, I love this piece. (Turns it up, then pantomimes that he is conducting the instruments)"
S07E17,KRAMER,"Alright, come on Frank. It's your shot."
S07E17,FRANK,(Complaining) I can't make anything..
S07E17,KRAMER,"(Like a professional) Well, that's because you don't know how to follow through correctly."
S07E17,FRANK,Follow through? What do you mean?
S07E17,KRAMER,"Right here, come on, I'll show you.. (Gets behind Frank, holding the pool stick with him) Take hold of your stick.. alright, bring it back slowly.."
S07E17,FRANK,"It's a little unnatural, but I think I'm getting the hang of it."
S07E17,ESTELLE,"Oh, my God!"
S07E17,[Setting,Jerry's apartment]
S07E17,JERRY,(Still ticked off) That woman is such an idiot! I was gonna do this whole bit on that bottle - and now I got nothing to talk about.
S07E17,ELAINE,"Well, have you ever considered writing new material?"
S07E17,JERRY,"Well, maybe if I didn't have so many people in my apartment all the time I'd be able to get some work done."
S07E17,ELAINE,(Getting the hint) Me? Are you talking about me?
S07E17,JERRY,(Deeply sarcastic) No. You're never here.
S07E17,ELAINE,"(Reflecting) Boy, that doll was really freaky, wasn't it?"
S07E17,JERRY,"Yeah. Really. (Forming and idea) Hey, you know what? Maybe I could talk about that on the show."
S07E17,ELAINE,What?
S07E17,JERRY,Show the doll - show the picture of George's mother.. it's pretty funny. (Moving toward the phone) I'm gonna call them.
S07E17,SALLY,Hello?
S07E17,JERRY,"Hello, Susan? It's Jerry."
S07E17,SALLY,"Hi Jerry, it's Sally!"
S07E17,JERRY,(Disappointed) Oh. Is George there?
S07E17,SALLY,"No, but he should be home soon."
S07E17,JERRY,"Uh, listen, this is important. Tell him to meet me at the TV studio with a picture of his mother and that doll that looks like her."
S07E17,SALLY,Is this for your comedy routine?
S07E17,JERRY,(Obviously resents talking to her) Yes.
S07E17,SALLY,(Gasps) Don't worry. (Like a detective) I'm on the case.
S07E17,[Setting,George's old bedroom]
S07E17,MAESTRO,"(Sighs slightly) I, uh, think I'll get some air. (Slowly leaves)"
S07E17,KRAMER,"Yeah.. (Sizes up his next shot. His stick jams into the window as he draws back) See? This is no good.. (Looks around the room. His sights fall on the Maestro's baton) Hey, the baton. (Chalks it up) I got a hunch, fat man, I can't miss. (Measures up his shot) 13 in the side pocket. (Does just that) Giddy-up. (Moves around to the other side of the board, judging his next move) Six in the corner. (Hits it in) This table's mine. (A series of Kramer's plays are displayed, and, on the last ball of the game..) You know where it's going.."

S07E17,JERRY,Not yet. (Points over to a man sitting in one of the room's chairs. Whispers) The other guy.
S07E17,ELAINE,"It's.. .. you! It's really you! Oh, I'm such a huge fan of yours. Would you mind signing this poster for me?"
S07E17,CARRERAS,My pleasure. (Reaches for a pen as Elaine unravels her poster)
S07E17,ELAINE,"(As he is signing) Oh, thank you so much. (He finishes. Elaine gives out a happy gasp) Thank you so much, Mr.. (Tries to read his signature) Camaro. (Carreras gives her a look as he is getting up) Mr. Casea? (He walks off as Elaine rolls the picture back up. Jerry gives his ""That's a shame"" face) Well, whatever. (To Jerry) I'm gonna take this to the Maestro. He's, he's playing at the Queens Convalescent Center."
S07E17,JERRY,"(Joking around) Well, that's one hell of a gig. (Turning around, he picks up a box labeled ""Ori-dent"") Hey, look, I got something for you. The Ori-dent!"
S07E17,ELAINE,(Mock joy) Ohh.. thank you. (Accepts the gift) Huh.. (Struggles under the size) Wha-- why does a toothbrush come in such a big box?
S07E17,JERRY,"Well, it's a delicate mechanism - It, you know, needs lots of packaging."
S07E17,ELAINE,(Still trying to get a grasp on the package) How am I supposed to carry this thing? (She looks up to see Jerry taking his pants off) What are you doing?
S07E17,JERRY,"Well, I want to sit down."
S07E17,ELAINE,So?
S07E17,JERRY,"It's a trick I just learned from Kramer. It keeps a crease in the pants. (Folds his pants over the head of a chair, then sits down in another.

S07E18,KRAMER,"Yeah, well, turns out that the master slept only twenty minutes every three hours. Now, that works out to two and a half extra days, that I'm awake per week, every week. Which means, if I live to be eighty, I will have lived the equivalent of a hundred and five years."

S07E18,BOB,Thank you. I'm having lunch with Mr P. I better get going.
S07E18,ELAINE,"Did you see that? Did you see that, Jerry?"
S07E18,JERRY,That was him?
S07E18,ELAINE,Yes.
S07E18,JERRY,Somehow I thought he'd be taller.
S07E18,ELAINE,"Alright, listen, we'll have to do this again some other time, okay? I got a lotta work to do."
S07E18,JERRY,"(standing) Alright, I'll see you later."
S07E18,ELAINE,Alright.
S07E18,JERRY,"Hey, Bob."
S07E18,JERRY,Bob.
S07E18,JERRY,"Hey, Bobby, over here."
S07E18,JERRY,"Bob. Oh, Bob."
S07E18,JERRY,(louder) Bob!
S07E18,BOB,Hi.
S07E18,JERRY,(urgent whisper) Elaine.
S07E18,ELAINE,(makes an irked noise)
S07E18,JERRY,I was just in the bathroom.
S07E18,ELAINE,"(really doesn't want to know) Okay, Jerry, please, please. I'm really busy here."
S07E18,JERRY,"No, no, no. I was just in the bathroom with that Bob guy."
S07E18,ELAINE,So what?
S07E18,JERRY,"No, I kinda tried to test his hearing."
S07E18,ELAINE,Get out! What'd you do?
S07E18,JERRY,"Well, I kinda snuck up behind him at the urinal and tried to see if he could hear me."
S07E18,ELAINE,(hopeful) And?
S07E18,JERRY,"Well, he flinched, sort of."
S07E18,ELAINE,"What d'you mean, sort of? What'd he do?"
S07E18,JERRY,"Well, he kinda moved his head, you know. It mighta been on the zip up, I dunno."
S07E18,ELAINE,So you don't know anything?
S07E18,JERRY,"Actually, no."
S07E18,ELAINE,"(sarcasm) Alright, good job."
S07E18,JERRY,Right.
S07E18,JERRY,Come in.
S07E18,GEORGE,"(entering) Last night, huh? Was that something, or was that something?"
S07E18,JERRY,That was something.
S07E18,GEORGE,"Ah. She's great, isn't she?"
S07E18,JERRY,(positive) Fantastic. Fantastic woman.
S07E18,GEORGE,I told you.
S07E18,JERRY,I'm nuts about her.
S07E18,GEORGE,You think she could be an 'it'? Could she be an 'it'?
S07E18,JERRY,She could be an 'it'.
S07E18,GEORGE,(claps hands triumphantly) We might have an 'it'!
S07E18,JERRY,She's got 'it' written all over her.
S07E18,GEORGE,"She's got everything, right? (counts on his fingers) She's intelligent, she's smart, she's got a great sense of humour."
S07E18,JERRY,"Well, I dunno. I didn't really talk to her."
S07E18,GEORGE,"Well, she's smart. You take my word for it."
S07E18,JERRY,Whatever.
S07E18,GEORGE,"(gleeful) Hehee. W..we could be like the Gatsbys. Didn't they always like, you know, a bunch of people around, and they were all best friends?"
S07E18,JERRY,That doesn't sound right.
S07E18,GEORGE,"No. So, tonight she's got tickets for that show she's been working on. The Flying Sandos Brother."
S07E18,JERRY,Flying Sandos. Beautiful.
S07E18,GEORGE,"Great. Seven-thirty, alright?"
S07E18,JERRY,Walk me down to the Friars.
S07E18,GEORGE,"Sure. So, uh, Jerry, there's an empty apartment in my building. If you and Hallie want, we could try and hold it, may..."
S07E18,JERRY,It's not here.
S07E18,GEORGE,What?
S07E18,JERRY,"Th..the jacket, it's not here. It's gotta be here somewhere."
S07E18,KRAMER,"Oh, boy."
S07E18,JERRY,(to Kramer) Thanks for that four a.m. wakeup call last night. (frustrated) Where the hell is that jacket?
S07E18,KRAMER,"Oh, the one with the crest."
S07E18,JERRY,Yeah.
S07E18,JERRY,"Oh, well, that's at the cleaners."
S07E18,JERRY,The cleaners? How did it get there?
S07E18,KRAMER,"Well, I, uh, I borrowed it last night and it got a little dirty."
S07E18,JERRY,(irritated) Great.
S07E18,KRAMER,(laughing to himself) Somehow I dozed off and woke up in a pile of garbage.
S07E18,JERRY,Somehow? You've had an hour and twenty minutes sleep in three days!
S07E18,KRAMER,"Well, so, look, the cleaner said you could pick it up tonight at six."
S07E18,JERRY,Alright. I just hope I can get it to the Friars Club before the show.
S07E18,GEORGE,Won't be a problem...(mumbles)
S07E18,JERRY,(to Kramer) Hey.
S07E18,JERRY,(louder) Hey!!
S07E18,KRAMER,"Watch out, boy."
S07E18,ELAINE,"Can you give us a hand with some of these boxes, Bob?"
S07E18,ELAINE,Bob!
S07E18,ELAINE,"(sexily) I want you so bad, Bob. You turn me on..."
S07E18,ELAINE,...so much. You're so damn...sexy.
S07E18,ELAINE,(sexy) Ohh. I'm starting to unbutton.
S07E18,ELAINE,(dropping the sexy voice) Anything getting through? Bob?
S07E18,HALLIE,"Well, they perform all over. Europe mostly."
S07E18,GEORGE,"A-ha, huh. (mumbles) tours."
S07E18,HALLIE,Yeah.
S07E18,JERRY,"Sorry, sorry I'm late."
S07E18,GEORGE/SUSAN,Hey!
S07E18,SUSAN,Jerry.
S07E18,GEORGE,"Isn't that the uh, Friars Club jacket?"
S07E18,JERRY,"Yeah, it wasn't ready on time. I have to return it after the show."
S07E18,GEORGE,"Sure, sure, sure, sure. (patting Jerry on the shoulders) How about these seats? Are these fantastic, huh? Huh? I feel like Lincoln."
S07E18,JERRY,"Yeah. Well, let's hope this evening turns out a little better."
S07E18,KRAMER,"So, uhm, are you sure you don't wanna go to the movies?"
S07E18,CONNIE,"Mmm, no, Cosmo. I like just being here with you."
S07E18,KRAMER,"Oh, it's uh, it's a bold adventure."
S07E18,KRAMER,"Ooh. Well, this is uh, risky business, huh? I'm all a-twitter."
S07E18,SANDOS BROTHER 1,How would you kind people like to lend a hand with our next trick?
S07E18,JERRY,(smiling) I don't think so.
S07E18,SANDOS BROTHER 1,"Please, take off your jacket."
S07E18,JERRY,My jacket?
S07E18,SANDOS BROTHER 1,"Yes, the jacket. (turns to the crowd) What do you say, ladies and gentlemen?"
S07E18,SANDOS BROTHER 1,(to Jerry) Can't argue with that.
S07E18,HALLIE,C'mon.
S07E18,SUSAN,"Do it. Come on, Jerry."
S07E18,GEORGE,Give him the jacket.
S07E18,JERRY,(giving in) Alright.
S07E18,SANDOS BROTHER 1,"And now, we say the magic word. (gestures with his hand) Agrabah! And we make it disappear."
S07E18,CONNIE,"(passionate) Oh Cosmo. Mm-mmm, Cosmo. Oh Cosmo."
S07E18,CONNIE,"(uncomfortable) Uh, honey, can you move a little, this hurts."
S07E18,CONNIE,(worried) Cosmo?
S07E18,CONNIE,"(panicky) Oh my god. Cosmo, wake up!"
S07E18,CONNIE,Cosmo?
S07E18,CONNIE,(horrified) Oh my god! He's dead! He's dead.
S07E18,CONNIE,"(into phone) Yeah, Tommy, this is Connie. You gotta help me. Some guy dropped dead on top of me. (listens) I can't call the cops, 'cos Joey might find out. (listens) I can't. I'm stuck. You gotta help me."
S07E18,GEORGE,This is very exciting. The inner sanctum.
S07E18,JERRY,Hi. I..I was in the audience earlier. You threw my jacket down. I just wanted to pick it up.
S07E18,SANDOS BROTHER 2,Jacket? What jacket?
S07E18,JERRY,"(explaining) I had a jacket with a crest on it. You came into the audience, you threw it away. Agrabah."
S07E18,SANDOS BROTHER 2,A..are you sure it was me?
S07E18,JERRY,"Well, it was either you or one of your brothers."
S07E18,SANDOS BROTHER 2,"Well, two of them have left already."
S07E18,SANDOS BROTHER 2,(shaking his head apologetically) No.
S07E18,JERRY,It doesn't even belong to me. It belongs to the Friars Club.
S07E18,SANDOS BROTHER 2,Sorry.
S07E18,HALLIE,"Jerry, I'm sure it'll turn up."
S07E18,JERRY,(cynical) I'm sure it won't.
S07E18,HALLIE,Don't worry. I'll get the jacket back.
S07E18,GEORGE,"(cheerful) Alright, there you go. She's gonna get the jacket back. (claps hands) So, let's go get some coffee, huh?"
S07E18,JERRY,"(downcast) No, I'm a little tired. I think I'll go home."
S07E18,SUSAN,"Aww, that's too bad."
S07E18,GEORGE,Really?
S07E18,JERRY,"Yeah, we'll do it another time."
S07E18,SUSAN,"(bright) George, we'll go."
S07E18,GEORGE,"I, uh, oh, broke a shoelace today."
S07E18,SUSAN,"Oh, I can get you shoelaces tomorrow."
S07E18,GEORGE,Okay.
S07E18,SUSAN,"So, what colour?"
S07E18,GEORGE,Brown.
S07E18,GEORGE,Maybe a black.
S07E18,SUSAN,Mmm.
S07E18,WAITRESS,More coffee?
S07E18,GEORGE,(urgent) No! Check! (quieter) Please.
S07E18,JERRY,(looking after the guys) That nut is always up to something.
S07E18,KRAMER,HEY!! Sh..! Shii! MAMA!!
S07E18,KRAMER,AAH! AAGH!
S07E18,PETERMAN,"Elaine. I think I've been working you a little too hard, lately."
S07E18,ELAINE,(shrugging it off) Oh.
S07E18,PETERMAN,"So, I have two tickets for you (holds up the bits of card) to the Flying Sandos Brothers magic show."
S07E18,ELAINE,(pleased) Ah.
S07E18,PETERMAN,It is a real hoot.
S07E18,ELAINE,"(delighted) Well, thank you Mr Peterman."
S07E18,PETERMAN,"Ah, the tickets are for tonight. So you and Bob can knock off a little early, so you both can get ready."
S07E18,ELAINE,"Mr Peterman, you..."
S07E18,PETERMAN,"(interrupting) There's no need to deny it, Elaine. I heard every word you said."
S07E18,PETERMAN,And I know you wouldn't be just having fun with his handicap. (staring away) That kind of cruelty would be grounds for dismissal.
S07E18,ELAINE,"(resigned) Of course, Mr Peterman."
S07E18,JERRY,"(into phone) Tell 'em I'll come down and talk to 'em. Okay, bye. (to George) Well, that was the Friars Club. D'you think they're gonna let a jacket-stealer join? I don't think so! They're gonna charge me eight hundred dollars for the jacket, and I gotta deal with Pat Cooper!"
S07E18,JERRY,"(worked up) Wh..what kinda show is that Sandos Brothers? They take your jacket, then they just throw it? I never heard of that!"
S07E18,GEORGE,"It's a little unusual. So, uh, Susan and I were thinking, uh, dinner at our house Saturday night. Just the four of us."
S07E18,JERRY,"(unenthusiastic) Uhh, I don't think so."
S07E18,GEORGE,(worried) Why not?
S07E18,JERRY,"(impassive) Ah, I'm a little turned off."
S07E18,GEORGE,"(standing) C'mon, what're you talking about?"
S07E18,JERRY,"Ahh, I'm, I'm kinda soured."
S07E18,GEORGE,You're soured?
S07E18,JERRY,"Yeah, I'm soured."
S07E18,GEORGE,Don't be soured.
S07E18,JERRY,I'm sorry. I'm soured.
S07E18,GEORGE,(animated) What're you kidding me? We were all getting along so well. Where is all this coming from?
S07E18,JERRY,"Well, you know, frankly, I don't think she was too concerned about my jacket."
S07E18,GEORGE,(animated) What're you talking about?! She's very concerned! She said she was gonna get it back.
S07E18,JERRY,"(indifferent) Yeah, we'll see."
S07E18,GEORGE,"(worked up) Because if she gets it back, then you'll have no reason to be sour. You'll de-sour, right?"
S07E18,JERRY,I'll try and de-sour.
S07E18,GEORGE,"(aggravated) Oh, that's not good enough! You don't try and de-sour. You have to sweeten too!"
S07E18,JERRY,(sharp) I'll try! I'll try and de-sour and sweeten.
S07E18,GEORGE,I wanna get it back when we were the Gatsbys.
S07E18,JERRY,I still don't know what that means.
S07E18,GEORGE,"(neither does he) Yeah, well."
S07E18,KRAMER,God.
S07E18,JERRY,(astonished) Oh god! What happened to you?!
S07E18,KRAMER,(animated) She tried to kill me Jerry!
S07E18,JERRY,Who?
S07E18,KRAMER,(shouts) Connie!
S07E18,JERRY,What'd she do?
S07E18,KRAMER,"I don't know! (building to a shout) But I woke up in the Hudson river in a SACK!! I think she drugged me, but she's a murderer and I'm calling the cops."
S07E18,JERRY,(bewildered) Why would she try and kill you?
S07E18,KRAMER,"(animated) Well, isn't it obvious? She doesn't want anybody else to have me!"
S07E18,KRAMER,(to door) Gah!
S07E18,JERRY,"Hey, there's uncle Milty."
S07E18,GEORGE,"(pleased) Yeah, it is."
S07E18,JERRY,(pointing) And there's David Steinberg.
S07E18,GEORGE,"The comedian, or the manager?"
S07E18,JERRY,The manager.
S07E18,JERRY,"(to George) Hey, there's Pat. (calls) Hey, Pat."
S07E18,PAT,"Hey, Jerry. What the hell went wrong? What's the matter with you? Are you a kleptomaniac, or what?"
S07E18,JERRY,I forgot to take it off.
S07E18,PAT,"(dubious) You forgot to take it off? Oh, you go into a department store, you put a suit on, and you walk right out. What are you some sort of an idiot?"
S07E18,JERRY,I'm sorry.
S07E18,PAT,Where's the jacket?
S07E18,JERRY,"Well, one of the gypsies took it."
S07E18,PAT,"(skeptical) Aww, the gypsies took it! Of course, New York has a lot of gypsies! Oh, on every block there's a gypsy!"
S07E18,GEORGE,"(meekly) Well, it's true. I saw it."
S07E18,PAT,"(probing) Excuse me, are you an entertainer? Are you in showbusiness?"
S07E18,GEORGE,"No, I uh..."
S07E18,PAT,"(interrupting) Then what am I talking to you for? (to Jerry) Jerry, bring the jacket back tomorrow."
S07E18,JERRY,Alright.
S07E18,GEORGE,"Wait a minute, wait a minute."
S07E18,GEORGE,Look at that guy. Right there. Isn't that the guy from the show? He's..he's wearing the jacket.
S07E18,JERRY,"God, you're right."
S07E18,GEORGE,(motioning Jerry to follow) C'mon.
S07E18,MAITRE D',"Wait a second! Excuse me gentlemen, are you members?"
S07E18,JERRY,"Well, I'm a prospective member."
S07E18,MAITRE D',"Until then, (pointing) that's the way out."
S07E18,JERRY,But that guy has my jacket.
S07E18,MAITRE D',"C'mon, let's go."
S07E18,GEORGE,"Excuse me, the guy is wearing a jacket that my friend is..."
S07E18,MAITRE D',Come on.
S07E18,JERRY,Come on.
S07E18,MAITRE D',Let's go.
S07E18,GEORGE,If I could talk to the guy for just a sec...
S07E18,BOB,These seats are fantastic. It was really nice of Mr Peterman to give us these tickets.
S07E18,ELAINE,"(flat) Yeah, yeah. Was nice."
S07E18,BOB,"(smiling) Yeah. Got our own little private box here, don't we?"
S07E18,ELAINE,(pushing Bob away) Get offa me! Stop it. Stop it.
S07E18,ELAINE,Get offa me!
S07E18,ELAINE,"Get a hold of yourself, Bob! (throwing Bob back between the seats) Get a hold of yourself!"
S07E18,JERRY,I dunno how that guy gave us the slip at the Friars Club.
S07E18,GEORGE,"I told you, he probably went out the back."
S07E18,JERRY,Ouf.
S07E18,JERRY,Hey. It's you! (pointing) Th..that's my Friars Club jacket!
S07E18,SANDOS BROTHER 1,"No, it is not. It is my jacket."
S07E18,JERRY,"(adamant) No, no, no. That's my jacket, give it back."
S07E18,SANDOS BROTHER 1,"No, it is not. This is mine."
S07E18,JERRY,C'mon I need it.
S07E18,JERRY,(determined) I wanna join. I need it to become a member.
S07E18,GEORGE,Give 'im the jacket already!
S07E18,SANDOS BROTHER 1,(yelling) Help! Help! (foreign language) Azobar! Azobar disay!
S07E18,GEORGE,What's he yelling about? They're stealing jackets here!
S07E18,JERRY,Can you believe it?!
S07E18,JERRY,"(examining) Hey George, you know what? I think this crest is different. It's got a moose on it."
S07E18,GEORGE,Moose?
S07E18,JERRY,Yeah. (subdued) I don't think this is the jacket.
S07E18,HALLIE,"No, it's not."
S07E18,HALLIE,This is the jacket.
S07E18,JERRY,"Ohh, you got the jacket back."
S07E18,GEORGE,"Ohh, yeahh."
S07E18,JERRY,(taking the jacket) Thank you.
S07E18,HALLIE,"It got a little dirty, so they wanted to clean it before they gave it back to you."
S07E18,JERRY,"Oh. (smiling) Oh, that's nice of 'em."
S07E18,GEORGE,(smiling) That is really nice.
S07E18,HALLIE,Yeah.
S07E18,JERRY,Yeah.
S07E18,HALLIE,Yeah.
S07E18,JERRY,Yeah.
S07E18,GEORGE,This is nice.
S07E18,JERRY,Yeahh.
S07E18,HALLIE,Yeah.
S07E18,GEORGE,"(forced buoyancy) Hey, you know, let's call Susan, we'll go have coffee."
S07E18,HALLIE,(flat) I'll see you at the wedding.
S07E18,GEORGE,(moody) Great! Now she's sour!
S07E18,JERRY,Maybe she'll sweeten.
S07E18,GEORGE,"(angry) She won't sweeten, and I'm bitter!"
S07E18,SANDOS BROTHER 1,(pointing) There they are!
S07E18,GEORGE,Here. (panicky) We'll leave it here for you!
S07E18,KRAMER,"(pointing) That's her, officer."
S07E18,CONNIE,"(shocked) Kramer! Oh my god, I thought you were..."
S07E18,KRAMER,(animated) What? Sleeping with the fishes? I guess I woke up!
S07E18,DETECTIVE,You're under arrest for the attempted murder of Cosmo Kramer.
S07E18,CONNIE,(defensive) I didn't do anything.
S07E18,KRAMER,"(sarcastic) Oh, yeah! Yeah!"
S07E18,DETECTIVE,"Get your coat, we gotta take you in."
S07E18,CONNIE,Can I call my lawyer?
S07E18,DETECTIVE,"Okay, go ahead."
S07E18,CONNIE,(on phone) You gotta meet me at the police station. They're arresting me for attempted murder.
S07E18,JACKIE,Attempted murder? Of whom?
S07E18,CONNIE,"This guy, Kramer."
S07E18,JACKIE,Oh. (hesitantly) Cosmo Kramer?
S07E18,CONNIE,"(surprised) Yeah, that's right."
S07E18,JACKIE,(adamant) I don't want nothing to do with it.
S07E19,JERRY,I'm looking for a crested blazer
S07E19,CRAIG,A crested blazer..
S07E19,JERRY,I've worn one once and I really think it did something for me.
S07E19,CRAIG,(turning around) Yes .I Think we may have something. (picks up a blazer) The Joseph Aboud crested blazer is the finest.... That's hand ticking around the crest and these are the world famous Corriso buttons made from the finest Andulo corn.
S07E19,JERRY,(softly) Hmm.. they'll match my sneakers.
S07E19,CRAIG,It looks fabulous on you... shall I wrap it up?
S07E19,JERRY,You know...I'm not sure. I'll tell you what. I'll come back later with someone and see what they think.
S07E19,CRAIG,(doubtful) A Hum!
S07E19,JERRY,Really I'll be back.
S07E19,CRAIG,Yeah!
S07E19,JERRY,"So I didn't like the crest all that much., but the guy spent fifteen minutes with me so to get out of the store I told I wanted to see what someone else thought.... And then he makes a face like he doesn't believe me."
S07E19,ELAINE,Ah! So he knew that you were making it up.!
S07E19,JERRY,Yeah..... He caught me So here's what I want you to do. Come back with me to the store and we'll pretend to look at the coat.
S07E19,ELAINE,That's ridiculous. Why do do you want to go back there if you don't want the coat?
S07E19,JERRY,Because he thinks I was lying and I want to show him I wasn't.
S07E19,ELAINE,But you were!!
S07E19,JERRY,"But if you go back with me , then I'm not."
S07E19,GEORGE,(still on the phone) All right fine.... Whatever
S07E19,JERRY,(to George) Problems with the house guest?
S07E19,ELAINE,What house guest?
S07E19,GEORGE,This friend of Susan's is staying with us for two weeks...Now am I wrong or is that excessive?
S07E19,KRAMER,Well Bob Sacamano he stayed with me once for a year and a half.
S07E19,ELAINE,Who is he?
S07E19,GEORGE,He's a wig master
S07E19,ELAINE,What is a wig master?
S07E19,GEORGE,He's with the touring company of Joseph and the Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat. He's the guy in charge of the wigs.
S07E19,JERRY,Boy.. imagine.. liking wigs to the point it becomes a career choice.
S07E19,KRAMER,"About some tickets George , you know I'd kill for a peek.."
S07E19,GEORGE,"(leaving) Yeah, Sure, sure ,,, I got to drop my car off at the new lot."
S07E19,KRAMER,Euh what...What lot is that?
S07E19,GEORGE,Jiffy Park. It's incredible.. Seventy-five dollars a month.
S07E19,KRAMER,Seventy -five bucks a month!
S07E19,GEORGE,Yeah and you get this really cool T-shirt when you sign on..
S07E19,KRAMER,Oh I'm down.
S07E19,JERRY,(proud of himself) Remember me? I said I 'd come back with someone and I did. Surprised?.
S07E19,CRAIG,No I believed you.
S07E19,JERRY,Yeah.... well Elaine.
S07E19,ELAINE,(looking up to the salesman)
S07E19,CRAIG,Oh!... hello I'm Craig.
S07E19,ELAINE,.....Hi.
S07E19,CRAIG,well (picks up the blazer again) here it is.
S07E19,ELAINE,Oh!!.....Joseph Aboud .. and look at this hand ticking around the crest.
S07E19,CRAIG,You know your coats?
S07E19,ELAINE,Well I'm in the biz .. I work for J. Peterman.
S07E19,CRAIG,I love J. Peterman.
S07E19,ELAINE,(giggling) Ohhh!!.
S07E19,CRAIG,"I especially enjoy the catalogue, those fanciful narratives really take me away.."
S07E19,ELAINE,"Ohhh!! really ..well you know what, I write those."
S07E19,CRAIG,No!!!
S07E19,ELAINE,Yeeeahh!!!
S07E19,JERRY,(impatiently cutting in) Hey Elaine What about the crest.? What d'you think of the crest here.
S07E19,JERRY,You what??
S07E19,ELAINE,I think it's great. I think you should get it.
S07E19,CRAIG,Well .... Will it be check or credit card?
S07E19,JERRY,(giving up) Check.
S07E19,CRAIG,I'll need you to write down your phone number on the check for me. (turning to Elaine) Perhaps you could do the same.
S07E19,ELAINE,(laughs and giggles like a schoolgirl)
S07E19,JERRY,You weren't supposed to say that.

S07E19,ATTENDANT,Here take a few shirts....
S07E19,ATTENDANT,"I'm terribly sorry Mr Kramer but we can't get your car now, the keys seems to have been misplaced."
S07E19,KRAMER,Wait a minute I need those keys. I wont be able to get into my apartment.

S07E19,JERRY,"It's been known to happen....... telling you right now Elaine, this guy 's gonna dangle that dress in front of you like a dirt farmer dangles a carrot in front of a mule."
S07E19,ELAINE,. Well this is all very flattering...
S07E19,JERRY,(interrupts)like a shark fisherman with a bucket of (?) Ch....
S07E19,ELAINE,Ok....
S07E19,JERRY,(continues)Like a shrimp farmer....

S07E19,ELAINE,So you're giving him a discount too?
S07E19,CRAIG,Hummm Why so surprised?
S07E19,ELAINE,Hem!! No reason.
S07E19,JERRY,You know that clothing salesman had a lot of nerve hitting on Elaine right in front of me. He stands to make a big commission too on that jacket with the crest that nobody seems to like. You know what I'm gonna do.? I'm gonna take that jacket back.. I'm putting this guy ....RIGHT OUT OF COMMISSION....
S07E19,KRAMER,Heeeeeummmrph.... I'm gonna turn in
S07E19,JERRY,Turn in?
S07E19,KRAMER,"Yeah,I had a tough day"
S07E19,JERRY,It's only nine o clock.
S07E19,KRAMER,Well ..I don't argue with the body Jerry. It's an argument you can't win.
S07E19,JERRY,I can't go to sleep at nine o clock!
S07E19,KRAMER,Well you can go to your room and read.
S07E19,JERRY,"Hey look ,you know, you're the one who's locked out. I'm letting you stay here. You're wearing my bathrobe. You should adapt to me."
S07E19,KRAMER,But I'm tired..
S07E19,JERRY,Oh why don't you go sleep over at Newman's.
S07E19,KRAMER,Aah! He's got a girl up there. This quilt is too thin...I know I'm gonna get cold. I don't even fit on this couch. Don't even know if I'm gonna sleep....
S07E19,JERRY,Well that's all I got.
S07E19,KRAMER,Can I sleep with you?
S07E19,JERRY,Huh?
S07E19,KRAMER,Well you got that big comfortable bed and that nice warm quilt.
S07E19,JERRY,"Kramer , there's no way you're sleeping with me."
S07E19,KRAMER,Why?
S07E19,JERRY,Why?
S07E19,KRAMER,Yeah!
S07E19,JERRY,Do I really have to explain why?
S07E19,KRAMER,Well I......( Elaine pops in at that moment)
S07E19,ELAINE,Hi!.
S07E19,KRAMER,Hi...........What's that?
S07E19,ELAINE,Squire's walking stick. I had to write about it for the catalogue.
S07E19,KRAMER,Wow.
S07E19,ELAINE,You want it?
S07E19,KRAMER,Yeaaahmm....
S07E19,ELAINE,"You can have ,I don't need it anymore."
S07E19,KRAMER,Ooh Mama...( walks away)
S07E19,ELAINE,Ok so ..I am positive you are wrong about Craig.
S07E19,JERRY,Yeah Why?
S07E19,ELAINE,Because he told a man he'd give him a discount too... a man Jerry.
S07E19,JERRY,"So ,Who is he?"
S07E19,ELAINE,Some friend of his from England.
S07E19,JERRY,Don't you see?...........It's all a big scam.
S07E19,ELAINE,You're nuts!
S07E19,KRAMER,How do you know he's not wondering the same thing about you?
S07E19,ELAINE,What d'you mean?
S07E19,KRAMER,"What do I mean?.. Well perhaps he thinks that you're working him for the discount. Shaking that little butt of yours into big, big savings.... And then when you get it,you know, you drop him like a hot potato."
S07E19,ELAINE,Aawwh Please.....
S07E19,KRAMER,Now see the two of you need to work on trust... and then and only then will there be a free exchange of sex and discounts.. Cornerstones of a healthy relationship....and now if you would (taps twice on the door) excuse us. We need to get to bed.
S07E19,KRAMER,(softly)hmmm....patio furniture's on sale.
S07E19,GEORGE,Excuse me...huh... I think I made a big mistake. I'd like my deposit back please.
S07E19,ATTENDANT,Whats the problem
S07E19,GEORGE,You got hookers turning tricks in my car. How's that for starters.
S07E19,ATTENDANT,Haaan! That is all hearsay.
S07E19,GEORGE,"Allright, very good I'd like my car and my deposit back please"
S07E19,ATTENDANT,Can't do it'
S07E19,GEORGE,Whadday'mean.?
S07E19,ATTENDANT,If you read the agreement you signed the deposit is not refundable.
S07E19,GEORGE,Well does it say anywhere in the contract about my car being used as a whorehouse? 'Cause I don't remember reading that clause either..
S07E19,ATTENDANT,What can I tell you buddy. Take it up with Consumer Affairs.
S07E19,GEORGE,". All right , just give me my car and let me get the hell out of here."
S07E19,ATTENDANT,Well that's going to be a problem
S07E19,GEORGE,Why?
S07E19,ATTENDANT,It's all the way in the back. Can't get it out for a couple of days.
S07E19,GEORGE,What are you talking about.. I WANT MY CAR!!
S07E19,ATTENDANT,We ask that you please bear with us.
S07E19,GEORGE,Bear with you! This is a parking lot PEOPLE ARE SUPPOSED TO BE ABLE TO GET
S07E19,ATTENDANT,Ideally..
S07E19,JERRY,Excuse me I'd like to return this jacket.
S07E19,TELLER,Certainly. May I ask why?
S07E19,JERRY,........For spite...
S07E19,TELLER,Spite?
S07E19,JERRY,That's right. I don't care for the salesman that sold it to me.
S07E19,TELLER,I don't think you can return an item for spite.
S07E19,JERRY,What do you mean?
S07E19,TELLER,"Well if there was some problem with the garment. If it were unsatisfactory in some way, then we could do it for you, but I'm afraid spite doesn't fit into any of our conditions for a refund"
S07E19,JERRY,"That's ridiculous, I want to return it. What's the difference what the reason is."
S07E19,TELLER,Let me speak with the manager...excuse me .............Bob!
S07E19,TELLER,........spite.....(Manager walks over)
S07E19,BOB,What seems to be the problem?
S07E19,JERRY,Well I want to return this jacket and she asked me why and I said for spite and now she won't take it back.
S07E19,BOB,That's true. You can't return an item based purely on spite.
S07E19,JERRY,. Well So fine then ..then I don't want it and then that's why I'm returning it
S07E19,BOB,Well you already said spite so......
S07E19,JERRY,But I changed my mind..
S07E19,BOB,No...you said spite...Too late.
S07E19,KRAMER,It's Halloween (not sure)
S07E19,CHARMAINE,Get a calendar honey! It's the 90's

S07E20,KRAMER,Oh bold and beautiful.
S07E20,MR. STEINBRENNER,I am loving this calzone. The pita pocket prevents it from dripping. The pita pocket. (phone rings)What is it Watson? A lost and found. No. I don't think we need that. If people keel over because they lost something that's there tough luck. You got a drip on your mouth by the way.
S07E20,GEORGE,You know a lost and found could be a good idea.
S07E20,MR. STEINBRENNER,Hold on Watson. You like lost and found George?
S07E20,GEORGE,Definitely.
S07E20,MR. STEINBRENNER,All right lost and found. But these got to be a time limit. We're not running a pawn shop here.
S07E20,JERRY,"Hey, Elaine."
S07E20,ELAINE,Hi Jerry!
S07E20,JERRY,This is Nikki.
S07E20,NIKKI,Hi!
S07E20,ELAINE,Hello. This is Todd Gack.
S07E20,JERRY,Oh of course. Todd Gack. You did you bet was in Star Wars? Sammy Davis Jr.
S07E20,ELAINE,So what movie are you guys seeing?
S07E20,NIKKI,"""Means to an End"""
S07E20,ELAINE,"Oh. We were going to see that but it was sold out. So were going to see""Blame it on the Rain"""
S07E20,JERRY,Why don't you see what you can do?
S07E20,NIKKI,Okay.
S07E20,ELAINE,What's she going to do? There's no more tickets.
S07E20,JERRY,We'll see.
S07E20,TODD,Hey Jerry. Do you like cigars?
S07E20,JERRY,Yeah. Why?
S07E20,TODD,I am going to Montreal tomorrow and they sell them dirt cheap.
S07E20,JERRY,"Hey,that might be a nice idea for George's wedding."
S07E20,TODD,So do you want a box?
S07E20,JERRY,Sure. If there cheap Why not.
S07E20,TODD,All right I buy a box and give to Elaine.
S07E20,NIKKI,"Okay two tickets""Means to an End"""
S07E20,JERRY,Told you.
S07E20,ELAINE,How did you do that?
S07E20,NIKKI,I just talked to the manager.
S07E20,JERRY,"All right. Enjoy""Blame it on the Rain"""
S07E20,GEORGE,There putting in a lost and found because of me. There's a time limit but still.
S07E20,JERRY,There really building a Utopian society up there huh.And you tribute all this to the calzone.
S07E20,GEORGE,Yeah. I am like a drug dealer. I got the guy hooked. I am having lunch at his desk everyday this week. He doesn't make a move without me. It's very exciting.
S07E20,JERRY,With you two guys at the helm. The last piece of the puzzle is in place.
S07E20,GEORGE,So let me ask you a question about the tip jar. I had a little thing with the calzone guy this week. I go to drop a buck in the tip jar and just as I am about to drop it in he looks the other way. And then when I am leaving he gives me this look think thanks for nothing. I mean if they don't notice it what's the point.
S07E20,JERRY,So you don't make it a habit of giving to the blind.
S07E20,GEORGE,Not bills.
S07E20,JERRY,So George. Remember when I told you Nikki gets whatever she wants. We are at the movies last night. It's sold out. Nikki goes and talks to the manager. Right in.
S07E20,GEORGE,Beautiful women. You know they could get away with murder. You never she any of them lift anything over three pounds. They get whatever they want whenever they want it. You can't stop them.
S07E20,JERRY,She's like a beautiful Godzilla.
S07E20,GEORGE,Without thousands of fleeing Japanese.
S07E20,KRAMER,Hey buddy.
S07E20,JERRY,What the hell is all this?
S07E20,KRAMER,I am looking for quarters for the dryer.
S07E20,JERRY,Why can't you do this on your table?
S07E20,KRAMER,Because I don't have a table.
S07E20,ELAINE,Hey.
S07E20,JERRY,"Hey. So how was""Blame it on the Rain?"""
S07E20,ELAINE,Huh. Yeah thanks for getting us tickets too.
S07E20,JERRY,Oh!! Let me ask you a question. Was the movie part of the bet?
S07E20,ELAINE,No. We were both in the mood for one.
S07E20,JERRY,"You know Elaine, It is not my way to intrude on the personal lives of close fiends...."
S07E20,ELAINE,Oh is that so.
S07E20,JERRY,Absolutely. But I feel I must inform you that what happened last night was more than a simple bet.
S07E20,ELAINE,What are you talking about?
S07E20,JERRY,Come on. Dustin Hoffman in Star Wars. He made a bet he knew he was going to lose just to take you to dinner
S07E20,ELAINE,If he wanted to ask me out why didn't he just ask me.
S07E20,JERRY,Because if he doesn't ask you out he doesn't get rejected. He has found a dating loop hole.
S07E20,ELAINE,I don't buy it.
S07E20,JERRY,So what happened after the movie?
S07E20,ELAINE,Nothing. He walked me home.
S07E20,JERRY,To the door?
S07E20,ELAINE,Yeah.
S07E20,JERRY,That's a date.
S07E20,ELAINE,No it's not.
S07E20,JERRY,But I never walk you home.
S07E20,ELAINE,That's just because your a jackass.
S07E20,KRAMER,Ah!! I found a quarter. Anybody want there clothes heated up?
S07E20,JERRY,"No, no."
S07E20,ELAINE,"No, no."
S07E20,JERRY,So how did you leave it with him?
S07E20,ELAINE,I am supposed to meet him to pick up your cigars.
S07E20,JERRY,That's another loop hole. That's two dates without asking you out.
S07E20,ELAINE,Your crazy!
S07E20,JERRY,Crazy like a man.
S07E20,WORKER,Number 49.
S07E20,GEORGE,You know my last name is Costanza. That's Italian. So you and I are like country men. Pisano's!
S07E20,WORKER,$ 6.50 your change.
S07E20,GEORGE,"And I always take care of my Pisano's. So here is a little something. (drop in tip and worker looks the other way, so George decides to take it out and try again only to get caught)"
S07E20,WORKER,Hey! You steal my money!!
S07E20,GEORGE,No no. That's not what I was trying to do.
S07E20,WORKER,I know what you try to do. Get out. Don't ever come back ever.
S07E20,GEORGE,I got your calzones Mr. Steinbrenner.
S07E20,MR. STEINBRENNER,Beautiful. I am starving George.
S07E20,GEORGE,I thought tomorrow maybe we'd try a little corn beef.
S07E20,MR. STEINBRENNER,Corn beef. I don't think so. It is a little fatty.
S07E20,GEORGE,How about Chinese?
S07E20,MR. STEINBRENNER,"Uhhhhh. No. Too many containers. Big mess, big mess. Too sloppy.I want to stick with the calzones from Pisano's. That's the ticket."
S07E20,GEORGE,I just thought it would be nice. A little variety.
S07E20,MR. STEINBRENNER,"No, no, no. George let me tell you something. When I find something I like I stick with it. From 1973 to 1982 I ate the exact same lunch everyday. Turkey chili in a bowl made out of bread. Bread bowl George. First you eat the chili then you eat the bowl. There's nothing more satisfying than looking down after lunch and seeing nothing but a table."
S07E20,ELAINE,Thanks for the dinner.
S07E20,TODD,Well I had to give these cigars and we were both hungry.
S07E20,ELAINE,Hey Todd. Let me ask you a question. Um. Was this whole date thing just a way of asking me out?
S07E20,TODD,What?
S07E20,ELAINE,I mean Dustin Hoffman in Star Wars?
S07E20,TODD,Elaine that was a legitimate bet and I lost so I bought you dinner.
S07E20,ELAINE,"Oh all right. Okay well, goodnight."
S07E20,TODD,"Hey, if your not doing anything Saturday do you want to meet somewhere?"
S07E20,ELAINE,See what is that? Is that a date?
S07E20,TODD,Why can't two people go and do something without it being a date?
S07E20,ELAINE,All right. I am sorry it's not a date.
S07E20,TODD,No way. So I'll see you Saturday night?
S07E20,ELAINE,All right.
S07E20,TODD,Pick you up at 800 p.m.
S07E20,POLICE OFFICER,Do you know what the posted speed limit on this road is?
S07E20,JERRY,I was got to be 55.
S07E20,POLICE OFFICER,That's right it is. Do you know how fast you were going?
S07E20,JERRY,A lot faster than that!
S07E20,POLICE OFFICER,Step out of the car sir.
S07E20,JERRY,Okay dokey
S07E20,POLICE OFFICER,Can I have your license and registration please?
S07E20,JERRY,Absolutely. Nikki!
S07E20,NIKKI,Yes.
S07E20,JERRY,Would you mind bringing the officer the registration?
S07E20,NIKKI,Not at all.
S07E20,POLICE OFFICER,I got you on the radar at 93 miles per hour.
S07E20,JERRY,You must have gotten me when I slowed down to take that curve because for a while there I was doing well over 100.
S07E20,NIKKI,Officer. Hi. Do you really have to give us a ticket?
S07E20,JERRY,All right Nik. That's it.
S07E20,KRAMER,Hey buddy. I am waiting for my shirt.
S07E20,JERRY,You got your shirt in my oven!?!
S07E20,KRAMER,I didn't have any quarters for the dryer. Anyway this is better. And it's more convenient.
S07E20,JERRY,For both of us.
S07E20,KRAMER,And I have a lot more control. I have one shirt going for 10 minutes at 325 degrees.
S07E20,JERRY,What's wrong with your oven?
S07E20,KRAMER,I am baking a pie!
S07E20,JERRY,Yeah.
S07E20,GEORGE,Yeah.
S07E20,JERRY,Come on up.
S07E20,KRAMER,"You got cigars, huh."
S07E20,JERRY,I got some Cubans for George's wedding. They were more than I wanted to pay for but what the hell!
S07E20,KRAMER,"Oh yeah baby. spit, spit. What are these?""Perducto de Peru""Jerry, if you think these are Cubans you have another thing coming."
S07E20,JERRY,Peru! I paid $300 bucks for these. I could have bought a house in Peru for $300 bucks!
S07E20,KRAMER,You got ripped buddy.
S07E20,JERRY,I got to pay this Todd Gack guy $300 bucks just so he has some excuse to see Elaine again without asking her out.
S07E20,KRAMER,That's a nice name. Todd Gack. Is that Dutch? (Dingggggg) Oh baby. Here we go. Uh momma.(putting his fresh out of the oven shirt on) Hey George hey.
S07E20,GEORGE,Well this is bad. I am really in a bad situation now.
S07E20,JERRY,so what is Steinbrenner going to do if he doesn't get his calzones?
S07E20,GEORGE,What's he going to do? That's exactly the point. Nobody knows what this guy is capable of! He fires people like it is a bodily function.
S07E20,JERRY,Why don't you get someone else from the office to go get Pisano's for you?
S07E20,GEORGE,Because before you know it he'll be having lunch with him. You know how these interoffice politics work.
S07E20,JERRY,No. I never had a job.
S07E20,KRAMER,I decided to go with the brown one 's. (pants)
S07E20,GEORGE,What the hell is this?
S07E20,JERRY,Kramer's cooking up some corduroy.
S07E20,GEORGE,There has got to be some way to get back into Pisano's.
S07E20,KRAMER,Pisano's. That's the place by the stadium right?
S07E20,GEORGE,Yeah. You've heard of it?
S07E20,KRAMER,Yeah. Newman raves about it. It's on his mail route. He goes by there everyday.
S07E20,GEORGE,I'll see you guys later.
S07E20,JERRY,What kind of pie are you cooking?
S07E20,KRAMER,Huckleberry.
S07E20,NEWMAN,You certainly are in a bind.
S07E20,GEORGE,Yeah. And since you go buy there everyday. I was hoping that we could help each other out.
S07E20,NEWMAN,Oh well. Let me perfectly blunt. I don't care for you Costanza. You hang out at the west side of the building with Seinfeld all day and just it up wasting your lives.
S07E20,GEORGE,Are you going to help me or not?
S07E20,NEWMAN,"All right, all right. I'll help you but I will except something in return."
S07E20,GEORGE,What?
S07E20,NEWMAN,Well for starters I want a calzone of my own.....
S07E20,GEORGE,All right.
S07E20,NEWMAN,And a slice of pepperoni pizza and a large soda and three times a week I will require a canolie.
S07E20,GEORGE,That's a little steep don't you think?
S07E20,NEWMAN,You know I hear Mr. Steinbrenner can be a bit erratic. I would hate to see him when he's hungry.
S07E20,GEORGE,"All right, all right."
S07E20,NEWMAN,Do we have a deal?
S07E20,GEORGE,But I have to have them by one o'clock. He's very regiment about his meals.
S07E20,NEWMAN,"I know exactly how he feels. Pleasure doing business with you. Do come again. Ha, ha, ha, ha."
S07E20,ELAINE,This is nice.
S07E20,TODD,Gack. Party of four.
S07E20,ELAINE,Party of four? Who are we meeting?
S07E20,TODD,Mom! Dad! This is Elaine.
S07E20,MOM,Hello.
S07E20,ELAINE,Hellllllooooo.
S07E20,MOM,Nice meeting you.
S07E20,TODD,Bye mom.
S07E20,MOM,She's wonderful.
S07E20,ELAINE,What the hell was that?
S07E20,TODD,What?
S07E20,ELAINE,Why did you introduce me to your parents?
S07E20,TODD,There nice people. I thought you would like them.
S07E20,ELAINE,"Come on Todd. Admit it, this is a date."
S07E20,TODD,Why is this a date?
S07E20,ELAINE,Saturday night with your parents. Unless I'm your sister this is a date.
S07E20,TODD,Elaine. I don't understand why you can't meet someone else's parents without classifying it as a date.
S07E20,ELAINE,Well if it's not a date then what is it?
S07E20,TODD,It's a lovely evening together.
S07E20,ELAINE,I don't believe this.
S07E20,TODD,Well I am getting a cab want to join me?
S07E20,ELAINE,No. I'll just walk home.
S07E20,TODD,Okay goodnight. (goes to kiss her)
S07E20,ELAINE,Now what was that?
S07E20,NEWMAN,Hello. What 's this?
S07E20,GEORGE,Well I was dropping of the calzone money for the week.... Um shouldn't you be at work by now?
S07E20,NEWMAN,Work? It's raining.
S07E20,GEORGE,Soooooo
S07E20,NEWMAN,I called in sick. I don't work in the rain.
S07E20,GEORGE,"You don't work in the rain? Your a mailman.""Neither rain nor sleet nor snow.....""It's the first one."
S07E20,NEWMAN,I was never that big on creeds.
S07E20,GEORGE,You were supposed to deliver my calzones. We had a deal!
S07E20,NEWMAN,I believe the deal was that I get the calzones on my mail route. Well today I won't be going on my mail route! Will I. Perhaps tomorrow.
S07E20,GEORGE,But I'm paying you!
S07E20,NEWMAN,Yes thank you. (slams door)
S07E20,GEORGE,Newman!!
S07E20,NIKKI,Peru? I thought you wanted cigars from Cuba?
S07E20,JERRY,I did.
S07E20,NIKKI,Well if these aren't what you wanted then why did you pay him?
S07E20,JERRY,Well what could I do? Unless you pay him a visit.
S07E20,NIKKI,Okay.
S07E20,GEORGE,Kramer!
S07E20,KRAMER,Hey you!
S07E20,GEORGE,Look I need you to do me a favor. I need you to get me lunch at Pisano's.
S07E20,KRAMER,What happened to Newman?
S07E20,GEORGE,He called in sick.
S07E20,KRAMER,Oh yeah right it's raining.
S07E20,GEORGE,Can you do it?
S07E20,KRAMER,What time do you need it at?
S07E20,GEORGE,100 p.m. Do you need any money?
S07E20,KRAMER,No. I got eight tons of change. I'm loaded.
S07E20,KRAMER,Hey hold that bus!
S07E20,KRAMER,Hey. It's really wet out there.
S07E20,WORKER,What can I get you?
S07E20,KRAMER,I here you make a pretty mean calzone.
S07E20,WORKER,Calzone!
S07E20,KRAMER,Yeah calzone.
S07E20,WORKER,The best!
S07E20,KRAMER,All right. Lay them on me. I'll take three.
S07E20,WORKER,Three calzones.
S07E20,KRAMER,Hey. That's a big oven. Huh. Listen. I was wondering if you could do me a favor.
S07E20,ELAINE,Hey Todd.
S07E20,TODD,Hi. You know Nikki.
S07E20,ELAINE,Yeah sure.
S07E20,NIKKI,"Wait. Elaine will settle this. What's the""M""stand for in Richard M. Nixon?"
S07E20,ELAINE,Milhouse.
S07E20,NIKKI,I told you so. He said it was Moe. You owe me a dinner.
S07E20,WORKER,Your order is ready. Three calzones and one shirt and jacket.
S07E20,KRAMER,Oh. This is all burned up. Look at this.
S07E20,WORKER,What the hell do I know about cooking a shirt? What the hell is this? Your paying in pennies?
S07E20,KRAMER,That's all I got.
S07E20,WORKER,No. You have to have bills. Paper money. You can't pay with this.
S07E20,KRAMER,I told you this is all I got.
S07E20,WORKER,Then no calzones.
S07E20,GEORGE,What happened? Where have you been?
S07E20,KRAMER,The guy wouldn't give them to me because I wanted to pay in change.
S07E20,GEORGE,What the hell happened to your shirt?
S07E20,KRAMER,He overcooked it. It's ruined.
S07E20,GEORGE,Your clothes smell just like Pisano's. There's another Italian place on Jerome. Maybe I can fool him.
S07E20,MR. STEINBRENNER,(on phone) That's right. Do you want to say it again. I'll say it again. I hadn't had a pimple since I was eighteen and I don't care that you don't believe me or not. And how's this. Your fired. Okay your not. I am just a little hungry. Where's Costanza with my calzone. It's 115. He's late. That smell. I have to call you back. Costanza. He's in the building. Costanza is in the building and he's not in this office. Costanza! I'll get you.
S07E20,JERRY,Stupid cigars. You know if I didn't send Nikki over to talk to him they wouldn't be together.
S07E20,ELAINE,These are terrible.
S07E20,JERRY,It's like trying to smoke a chicken bone.
S07E20,ELAINE,What kind of a name is Todd Gack anyway.
S07E20,JERRY,I think it's Dutch. I got to get going.
S07E20,ELAINE,Where are you going?
S07E20,JERRY,I... uh....promised Nikki that I'd walk her dog for her.
S07E20,ELAINE,But she broke up with you.
S07E20,JERRY,"I know, I know. But some how she explained it to me and I couldn't say no."
S07E20,ELAINE,It smells like a rubber fire.
S07E20,JERRY,What's that?
S07E20,ELAINE,I said rubber fire.
S07E20,JERRY,Oh.
S07E20,ELAINE,Did you ever pay Todd for these things?
S07E20,JERRY,Actually it's being taken care of right now.
S07E20,KRAMER,You Gack?
S07E20,TODD,Yeah.
S07E20,KRAMER,Here's your money.
S07E20,MR. STEINBRENNER,George. Why do these clothes smell like Pisano's?
S07E20,GEORGE,Because they were heated up there.
S07E20,MR. STEINBRENNER,Heating up your clothes? That's not a bad idea.
S07E21,WILHELM,And you can tell the players that I reimburse the trainer for the cigarettes and the dive checks.
S07E21,GEORGE,"Sorry, the players will be reimbursed?"
S07E21,WILHELM,"The trainer, George. Tell the players I'll reimburse the trainer. What's the matter with you? This is the third time I've had to repeat myself."
S07E21,GEORGE,"Sorry, Mr Wilhelm."
S07E21,WILHELM,"Look, sorry doesn't cut it. We're running a ball club here George. You've got to pay attention."
S07E21,GEORGE,"I know, sir. It won't happen again."
S07E21,WILHELM,"Lemme see, I uh, I had an assignment for you... uh."
S07E21,WILHELM,Lemme think here.
S07E21,PETERMAN,Elaine.
S07E21,ELAINE,"Hi, Mr Peterman."
S07E21,PETERMAN,You know what a huge fan I am of John F Kennedy.
S07E21,ELAINE,I do.
S07E21,PETERMAN,It was the Peace Corps that gave me my start in this business. (nostalgic) Clothing the naked natives of Bantu Besh.
S07E21,ELAINE,The pygmy pullover.
S07E21,PETERMAN,"Sotheby's is having an auction of JFK's memorabilia. One item in particular has caught my eye. The presidential golf clubs. To me, they capture that indefinable romance that was Camelot."
S07E21,ELAINE,Whatever.
S07E21,PETERMAN,"But, unfortunately I will be out of town with my lady-friend and therefore unable to bid on the lot. I was hoping maybe you would go in my stead."
S07E21,ELAINE,"Oh. (pleasant surprise) Oh yeah, I'd be happy to. Uhm, how much d'you want this thing? (smilingly) I mean, you know, how high are you willing to go?"
S07E21,PETERMAN,"I would see no trouble in spending up to, say, ten thousand dollars. Have my secretary give you a signed cheque."
S07E21,ELAINE,Wow.
S07E21,WILHELM,"...when you're done George, and bring it directly to me. Mr Steinbrenner is very interested in this."
S07E21,GEORGE,"Yes, sir."
S07E21,WILHELM,"(drying his hands and heading for the door) Yes, George. I want you to make this project a top priority."
S07E21,GEORGE,"I will, sir. Top priority."
S07E21,WILHELM,(exiting) Top priority.
S07E21,GEORGE,Top priority.
S07E21,GEORGE,"So he walks out of the stall, he's been talking the whole time."
S07E21,JERRY,He pulled an LBJ on you.
S07E21,GEORGE,LBJ?
S07E21,JERRY,"Lyndon Johnson, used to do that to his staffers."
S07E21,GEORGE,No kidding?
S07E21,JERRY,Oh yeah. He'd hold national security meetings in there. He planned the Hanoi bombing after a bad Thai meal.
S07E21,GEORGE,"Well, I still don't know what I'm supposed to do. I don't even know what my assignment is."
S07E21,JERRY,Ask him to repeat it. Tell him there was an echo in there.
S07E21,GEORGE,"I can't. He's been on my case about not paying attention. Besides, it's too late, I already told him I heard him."
S07E21,JERRY,"You know what you do? Ask him a follow-up question. Tell him you're having trouble getting started, and you want his advice."
S07E21,GEORGE,"Yeah, follow-up question, that'll work."
S07E21,KRAMER,Hey buddy.
S07E21,JERRY,Hey.
S07E21,GEORGE,Hey.
S07E21,JERRY,Can I have my keys...
S07E21,KRAMER,(tossing car keys to Jerry) Yeah.
S07E21,JERRY,"(catching keys) ...back, please?"
S07E21,KRAMER,"You shoulda come, Jerry."
S07E21,NEWMAN,We made quite a haul.
S07E21,GEORGE,Where'd you go?
S07E21,KRAMER,Price club.
S07E21,GEORGE,Why didn't you take your car?
S07E21,KRAMER,"Ah, the steering wheel fell off. I don't know where it is."
S07E21,KRAMER,What're you doing. (fetching the bottle from the trash) Don't throw that away.
S07E21,NEWMAN,"Well, I'm not paying the five cents for that stupid recycling thing."
S07E21,KRAMER,"You don't pay five cents, you get five cents back. Here, read the label here. (reads from bottle) Vermont, Connecticut, Massachusetts, New York. Refund, (brings bottle up close to Newman's eyes) vrrup, five cents."
S07E21,NEWMAN,(taking bottle) Refund?
S07E21,KRAMER,Yes.
S07E21,JERRY,"Well, what d'you think the hoboes are doing?"
S07E21,NEWMAN,"I don't know, they're deranged."
S07E21,GEORGE,"Awright, listen, can you uh, gimme a lift back to my place?"
S07E21,JERRY,No I can't. I gotta pick up Elaine. I'm taking her to this Kennedy auction.
S07E21,GEORGE,"Awright, I'll see you later."
S07E21,NEWMAN,"(peering at bottle label) What is this 'MI, ten cents'?"
S07E21,KRAMER,That's Michigan. In Michigan you get ten cents.
S07E21,NEWMAN,Ten cents!?
S07E21,KRAMER,Yeah.
S07E21,NEWMAN,"Wait a minute. You mean you get five cents here, and ten cents there. You could round up bottles here and run 'em out to Michigan for the difference."
S07E21,KRAMER,"No, it doesn't work."
S07E21,NEWMAN,What d'you mean it doesn't work? You get enough bottles together...
S07E21,KRAMER,"Yeah, you overload your inventory and you blow your margins on gasoline. Trust me, it doesn't work."
S07E21,JERRY,"(re-entering) Hey, you're not talking that Michigan deposit bottle scam again, are you?"
S07E21,KRAMER,"No, no, I'm off that."
S07E21,NEWMAN,You tried it?
S07E21,KRAMER,Oh yeah. Every which way. Couldn't crunch the numbers. It drove me crazy.
S07E21,JERRY,(leaving) You two keep an eye on each other?
S07E21,NEWMAN/KRAMER,(simultaneous) No problem. You bet.
S07E21,JERRY,Are you sure you didn't hear my car making a funny noise? I know those two idiots did something to it.
S07E21,ELAINE,"No, I didn't hear anything. (she spots a familiar face) Oh, my God, look who's here."
S07E21,JERRY,"Sue Ellen Mishke, the braless 'O Henry' candy bar heiress."
S07E21,SUE ELLEN,Well. Hello Elaine. Jerry.
S07E21,ELAINE,Hi Sue Ellen.
S07E21,JERRY,Hi Sue Ellen.
S07E21,SUE ELLEN,I'm surprised to see you here. Come to catch a glimpse of high society?
S07E21,ELAINE,"(faked laughter) Oh, ho ha ha. No, no, I'm actually here to bid, Sue Ellen. I mean that is if anything is to my liking."
S07E21,JERRY,I'm here to catch a glimpse... of high society.
S07E21,SUE ELLEN,"Well, I hope you find something that fits your budget."
S07E21,ELAINE,(half under her breath and half to Jerry) I... hate that woman.
S07E21,NEWMAN,I don't understand. You fill an eighteen-wheeler?
S07E21,KRAMER,"No, an eighteen-wheeler's no good. Too much overhead. You got permits, weigh-stations, tolls... Look, you're way outta your league."
S07E21,NEWMAN,I wanna learn. I want to know why.
S07E21,ELAINE,"(loudly, for the benefit of Sue-Ellen) Oh. Those are handsome. Look at that set. Yeah, think I might bid on those."
S07E21,AUCTIONEER,"Lot number seven forty-five. We have a full set of golf clubs, that were owned by President John F Kennedy, as seen in the famous photograph of the president chipping at Burning Tree on the morning of the Bay of Pigs invasion. The set in perfect condition, and we will start the bidding at four thousand dollars. Four thousand dollars? Do I have four thousand dollars?"
S07E21,AUCTIONEER,I have four thousand dollars. Do I have five? (another person bids) Five thousand dollars. I have five thousand dollars. Do I have six? Six thousand dollars for this set of beautiful clubs. (another bid) Six. I have six thousand dollars. Can I have sixty-five hundred?
S07E21,AUCTIONEER,"Sixty-five hundred to the dark-haired person on the right. We are at sixty-five hundred, do I hear sixty-six hundred?"
S07E21,AUCTIONEER,The president's own golf clubs. Leisure life at Camelot. Sixty-five hundred going once...
S07E21,SUE ELLEN,Eight thousand.
S07E21,AUCTIONEER,Eight thousand. We have eight thousand. The bid is now eight thousand dollars.
S07E21,ELAINE,(to Jerry) What is she doing? She's starting in on the bidding now? (to Auctioneer) Eighty-five hundred!
S07E21,AUCTIONEER,We have eighty-five...
S07E21,SUE ELLEN,Nine thousand.
S07E21,AUCTIONEER,Nine thousand dollars.
S07E21,JERRY,Think she wants those clubs.
S07E21,AUCTIONEER,Do I hear ninety-five? Ninety-five hundred...
S07E21,ELAINE,Ninety-five hundred.
S07E21,SUE ELLEN,Ten thousand.
S07E21,AUCTIONEER,"Ten thousand, to the shapely woman on the left. Ten thousand going once..."
S07E21,JERRY,"Well, that's your ceiling."
S07E21,AUCTIONEER,Ten thousand going twice...
S07E21,ELAINE,(determined) Eleven thousand!
S07E21,SUE ELLEN,Twelve thousand.
S07E21,ELAINE,(angrier) Thirteen thousand!
S07E21,SUE ELLEN,Fourteen thousand.
S07E21,ELAINE,(vicious) Fifteen thousand!!
S07E21,ELAINE,Peterman is gonna kill me.
S07E21,JERRY,I really thought you had her there at seventeen thousand.
S07E21,ELAINE,Why didn't you stop me?
S07E21,JERRY,Do you hear this clunking?
S07E21,ELAINE,(listening) A little.
S07E21,ELAINE,"Oh. You know what? (indicates clubs) I'm gonna grab these from you later. You'll take care of 'em, okay? Okay. See you tomorrow."
S07E21,JERRY,Okay.
S07E21,ELAINE,"Alrighty, bye."
S07E21,JERRY,Bye.
S07E21,JERRY,What's going on here?
S07E21,JERRY,Oh God!
S07E21,JERRY,"(angry) Oh, you idiots!"
S07E21,NEWMAN,"So we could put the bottles in a U-haul. You know, go lean and mean?"
S07E21,KRAMER,"Newman, it's a dead-end, c'mon. (Jerry enters) Hey, there he is."
S07E21,JERRY,Hey. You put your groceries under the hood of my car?
S07E21,KRAMER,"(to Newman) Aw, that's right, we forgot about those."
S07E21,NEWMAN,(to Kramer) That's where my missing soda is.
S07E21,JERRY,"And your crab legs, and a thing of cheese. The Triple-A guy said I was this close to sucking a muffin down the carburetor. What were you thinking?"
S07E21,KRAMER,We ran outta space.
S07E21,JERRY,Now I gotta take the car down to Tony and get it checked out.
S07E21,KRAMER,"Ah, Tony, he's good."
S07E21,JERRY,"Yeah, he's real good. But he's so obsessive about the car. He makes me feel guilty about every little thing that's wrong with it. I gotta get it washed before I bring it down to him, or I'm afraid he'll yell at me."
S07E21,KRAMER,(offering the artichoke can) 'Choke?'
S07E21,JERRY,"No, thank you."
S07E21,TONY,"(lovingly) Oh, yeah. I remember this car. Beautiful car."
S07E21,JERRY,"Yeah. So, anyway, the engine's been idling a little rough. I thought it might be time for a check up..."
S07E21,JERRY,There's really nothing wrong on the inside.
S07E21,TONY,"Well, the shift knob is loose. You know about that?"
S07E21,JERRY,"No, I hadn't noticed."
S07E21,TONY,(accusingly) Have you been picking at it?
S07E21,JERRY,Have I been picking at it? No. You know. It's just wear and tear.
S07E21,TONY,(disapprovingly) Wear and tear. I see.
S07E21,JERRY,The engine is really the only thing that needs checking.
S07E21,TONY,You been rotating the tires?
S07E21,JERRY,Try to.
S07E21,TONY,(sharp) You don't try to. You do it! Fifty-one percent of all turns are right turns. You know that? 'Try to.'
S07E21,PETERMAN,"Twenty thousand dollars!?! Elaine, that's twice the amount I authorised you to spend."
S07E21,ELAINE,"I know, Mr Peterman, but but but but once I saw them, I just couldn't stand to let anyone else have them. (warming to her subject) You know, certainly not some stuck-up candy bar heiress who shamelessly flaunts herself in public without any regard..."
S07E21,PETERMAN,"Well, where are they?"
S07E21,ELAINE,(ingratiatingly) They should be here today.
S07E21,GEORGE,"Uh, Mr Wilhelm."
S07E21,WILHELM,(entering the office) Yes George.
S07E21,GEORGE,"Hi, I was just uh... I just had one little question about uh, my assignment."
S07E21,WILHELM,"Yes, well I trust things are moving smoothly. Mr Steinbrenner's counting on you, you know."
S07E21,GEORGE,"Yes, yes. Very smooth, super smooth. No, but I really wanna attack this thing, you know. Sink my teeth into it. So I was just wondering... what do you think would be the very best way to get started?"
S07E21,WILHELM,"(confusion) Get started? I don't understand, George."
S07E21,GEORGE,"Well, I was wondering..."
S07E21,WILHELM,You mean you haven't been to payroll?
S07E21,GEORGE,"Payroll? No, no, I haven't done that."
S07E21,WILHELM,"Well, what's the problem? Now come on George. I told the big man you were moving on this. Now, don't let him down!"
S07E21,GEORGE,Payroll!!
S07E21,[Yankee Stadium,Payroll Office]
S07E21,GEORGE,Hello there. I'm George Costanza.
S07E21,CLERK,Yes?
S07E21,GEORGE,"Assistant to the travelling secretary. (fishing for a reaction) I'm uh, working on the project."
S07E21,CLERK,What project?
S07E21,GEORGE,"Payroll project. Wilhelm? Big uh, big payroll project."
S07E21,CLERK,You're gonna have to fill me in.
S07E21,GEORGE,"You know what, I'll just uh, I'll just look around for a little while. (moving to come round the counter) I'll just browse around."
S07E21,CLERK,"(blocking George) Hey, wait, hey. Excuse me, uh, you can't come back here."
S07E21,GEORGE,"Look, I am under direct orders from Mr Wilhelm. So if you have a problem with that, maybe you should just take it up with him."
S07E21,CLERK,"Well, maybe I will."
S07E21,GEORGE,"(spotting possible salvation) You know what, I urge you to take it up with him. Go ahead, give him a call, he'll tell you what I'm doing here. (half to himself) Then you can tell me."
S07E21,CLERK,"(on phone) Mr Wilhelm, uh, this is Lafarge in payroll. Uh, there's a Costanza here, says he's working on some project?"
S07E21,CLERK,"(on phone) Oh. (he swaps the phone to his other ear) Oh, I see. (listens) Interesting. (listens) Well, that's quite a project. Alright, thank you."
S07E21,CLERK,"(apologetically) Ah, I'm sorry uh, that I doubted you. Whatever you need, just uh, make yourself at home."
S07E21,GEORGE,So he explained it all to you?
S07E21,CLERK,"Yes, he explained it all very clearly."
S07E21,GEORGE,What'd he tell you?
S07E21,CLERK,"(upset) Look! You were right, I was wrong! You don't have to humiliate me about it, alright!"
S07E21,NEWMAN,Damn!
S07E21,NEWMAN (V.O.),"Oh, Mother's Day. (inspiration strikes) Wait a second. Mother's Day?!"
S07E21,NEWMAN,(triumphant) Yessss!
S07E21,NEWMAN,Ahaha!
S07E21,NEWMAN,Come on Kramer!
S07E21,KRAMER,Wha...?
S07E21,NEWMAN,"It's the truck, Kramer. The truck!"
S07E21,KRAMER,"Look, Newman, I told you to let this thing go."
S07E21,NEWMAN,"No, no, no, no no. Listen to me. Most days, the post office sends one truckload of mail to the second domestic regional sorting facility in Sagenaw, Michigan."
S07E21,KRAMER,(interested) Uh-huh.
S07E21,NEWMAN,"But, on the week before holidays, we see a surge. On alentine's Day, we send two trucks. On Christmas, four, packed to the brim. And tomorrow, if history is any guide, will see some spillover into a fifth truck."
S07E21,KRAMER,(realisation) Mother's Day.
S07E21,NEWMAN,The mother of all mail days. And guess who signed up for the truck.
S07E21,KRAMER,"A free truck? Oh boy, that completely changes our cost structure. Our G and A goes down fifty percent."
S07E21,NEWMAN,"(excited) We carry a coupla bags of mail, and the rest is ours!"
S07E21,KRAMER,"Newman, you magnificent bastard, you did it!"
S07E21,NEWMAN,(triumph) Let the collecting begin!
S07E21,[Yankee Stadium,George's Office]
S07E21,WILHELM,So...
S07E21,WILHELM,...did you go down to payroll?
S07E21,GEORGE,"(standing) Yes, payroll. Yes I did. Very productive. Payroll... Paid off."
S07E21,WILHELM,"(pleased) Well then, I guess you'll be heading downtown then, huh?"
S07E21,GEORGE,"Oh, yeah. Downtown. Definitely."
S07E21,WILHELM,"Well, I'm very interested to see how this thing turns out."
S07E21,GEORGE,"(to himself) Yeah, you said it. (to Wilhelm) Uh, excuse me, Mr Wilhelm. Uh, do you really think... Well, is this downtown trip really necessary, you know, for the project?"
S07E21,WILHELM,"Oh no, you've got to go downtown, George. It's all downtown. Just like the song says."
S07E21,GEORGE,The song?
S07E21,WILHELM,There's your answer. Downtown.
S07E21,GEORGE,(thoughtful) Downtown.
S07E21,JERRY,The song Downtown? You mean the Petula Clark song?
S07E21,GEORGE,Yeah.
S07E21,JERRY,You sure he didn't just mention it because you happened to be going downtown?
S07E21,GEORGE,"I think he was trying to tell me something, like it had some sort of a meaning."
S07E21,JERRY,"Okay, so how does it go?"
S07E21,GEORGE,"'When you're alone, and life is making you lonely, you can always go...'"
S07E21,JERRY,'... downtown.'
S07E21,GEORGE,"'Maybe you know some little places to go, where they never close...'"
S07E21,JERRY,'...downtown.'
S07E21,GEORGE,"Wait a second. 'Little places to go, where they never close.' What's a little place that never closes?"
S07E21,JERRY,Seven-eleven?
S07E21,GEORGE,"'Just listen to the music of the traffic, in the city. Linger on the sidewalk, where the neon lights are pretty.' Where the neon lights are pretty. The Broadway area?"
S07E21,JERRY,"No, that's midtown."
S07E21,GEORGE,"'The lights are much brighter there. You can forget all your troubles, forget all your cares, just go...'"
S07E21,JERRY,'...down town.'
S07E21,GEORGE,"'Things'll be great, when you're...'"
S07E21,JERRY,'...downtown.'
S07E21,GEORGE,"I got nothing, Jerry. Nothing."
S07E21,JERRY,"Well, 'don't hang around and let your troubles surround you. There are movie shows...'"
S07E21,GEORGE,"You think I should come clean? What d'you think, you think I Should confess?"
S07E21,JERRY,How can you lose?
S07E21,TONY (O.S.),"Yeah, Jerry, it's Tony Abato at the shop. Look, we gotta talk. You better come down, any time after four."
S07E21,JERRY,Hello.
S07E21,ELAINE,"Hi, it's me."
S07E21,JERRY,"Oh, hi."
S07E21,ELAINE,"Listen, I need to come over and pick up the clubs for Peterman."
S07E21,JERRY,"Oh, you know what?"
S07E21,ELAINE,(worry) Oh no. What?
S07E21,JERRY,"Oh, no. It's no big deal. I left the clubs in the car."
S07E21,ELAINE,You left them in the car? How could you leave them in the car?
S07E21,JERRY,I forgot.
S07E21,ELAINE,"Oh, go down and get them."
S07E21,JERRY,I can't. The car's at the mechanics.
S07E21,ELAINE,"Ah, this is great. Alright, well, where is the mechanic? I'll just go and pick 'em up myself."
S07E21,JERRY,"No, no, you can't. He's working on the car right now. You can not disturb him while he's working. But I'm going down there in like an hour, if you wanna meet me down there. You know the place, it's on fifty-sixth street?"
S07E21,ELAINE,"(resigned) Ugh, okay, alright, fine."
S07E21,JERRY,"Hey, Tony."
S07E21,TONY,"Thanks for coming in, Jerry."
S07E21,JERRY,Sure.
S07E21,TONY,"I think I know what's goin' on here, and I just wanna hear it from you. But I want you to be straight with me. Don't lie to me, Jerry. You know that motor oil you're puttin' in there? (reproachful) From one of those quicky lube places, isn't it?"
S07E21,JERRY,"Well, I change it so often, I mean to come all the way down here..."
S07E21,TONY,"Jerry, motor oil is the lifeblood of a car. Okay, you put in a low-grade oil, you could damage vital engine parts. Okay. (holds up component) See this gasket? (throws it down) I have no confidence in that gasket."
S07E21,JERRY,I really wanna...
S07E21,TONY,"Here's what I wanna do. I wanna overhaul the entire engine. But it's gonna take a major commitment from you. You're gonna have to keep it under sixty miles an hour for a while. You gotta come in, and you gotta get the oil changed every thousand miles."
S07E21,JERRY,How much money is this gonna cost me?
S07E21,TONY,"(contempt) Huh. I don't understand you. It's your own car we're talking about. You know you wrote the wrong mileage down on the form? You barely know the car. You don't know the mileage, you don't know the tyre pressure. When was the last time you even checked the washer fluid?"
S07E21,JERRY,The washer fluid is fine.
S07E21,TONY,(angry) The washer fluid is not fine!
S07E21,JERRY,"Alright, you know what, uhm... I just wanna take my car, and I'm gonna bring it someplace else."
S07E21,TONY,What d'you mean?
S07E21,JERRY,"Just, can I have my car? I wanna pay my bill, I'm gonna be on my way."
S07E21,TONY,"Well, the car's on a lift."
S07E21,JERRY,"Well, just get it down."
S07E21,TONY,"(subdued) Alright. Okay. Well, uhm, wait here and I'll uh, I'll bring it around."
S07E21,JERRY,"Okay. Thank you, very much."
S07E21,ELAINE,Hey. Where's the car?
S07E21,JERRY,He's bringing it.
S07E21,ELAINE,Good.
S07E22,JERRY (V.O.),Last week on Seinfeld.
S07E22,so far,"Newman and Kramer are using a USPS mail truck to run deposit bottles and cans to Michigan, in order to collect 10 cents on each of them. George has been given an assignment by Mr Wilhelm, but he hasn't a clue what it is. Elaine outbids Sue-Ellen Mishke at an auction, to buy John F Kennedy's golf clubs on behalf of Mr Peterman, and leaves them in the back of Jerry's car. Kramer and Newman have left groceries under the hood of Jerry's car, meaning Jerry has to take it to Tony the mechanic, who loves the car more than Jerry does. When Jerry asks for his car back, Tony flees in it, taking JFK's clubs with him."
S07E22,JERRY,"Okay, thank you. (hangs up the phone)"
S07E22,ELAINE,So? What'd they say?
S07E22,JERRY,They're sending a detective to my apartment tomorrow.
S07E22,ELAINE,What the hell were you thinking leaving my clubs in that car?!
S07E22,JERRY,"Well, I didn't count on my mechanic pulling a Mary-Beth Whitehead, did I?"
S07E22,ELAINE,What kind of maniac is this guy?
S07E22,JERRY,He's a very special maniac.
S07E22,ELAINE,What am I supposed to tell Mr Peterman.
S07E22,JERRY,I don't know.
S07E22,ELAINE,Why couldn't you take better care of that car?!
S07E22,PETERMAN,"Well, are they here?"
S07E22,ELAINE,"Mr Peterman, uh... There seems to be a bit of a snag."
S07E22,PETERMAN,Snag?
S07E22,ELAINE,It seems that a psychotic mechanic has absconded with my friend's car.
S07E22,PETERMAN,What does that have to do with my clubs?
S07E22,ELAINE,They happened to be in the back seat at the time.
S07E22,DETECTIVE,What was the suspect wearing at the time of the incident?
S07E22,JERRY,"You know, like mechanic's pants, a shirt that said 'Tony'. Lemme ask you something, have you ever seen a case like this before?"
S07E22,DETECTIVE,"All the time. A mechanic forms an emotional attachment, thinks he'sgonna lose the car, he panics, he does something rash. I'm gonna ask you somepersonal questions. I'm sorry if I touch a nerve, but I think it'll help with the case. Had you been taking good care of the car?"
S07E22,JERRY,Had I been taking...?
S07E22,DETECTIVE,"Well, did you leave the A/C on? Do you zip over speed bumps? Do you ride the clutch? Things like that."
S07E22,JERRY,"W-well, what does it matter? It's my car, I can do whatever I want with it."
S07E22,JERRY,Not that I would think of doing such things.
S07E22,DETECTIVE,"(making a note) Alright Mr Seinfeld, we'll let you know if we find anything. I gotta be honest with you, these cases never end up well."
S07E22,JERRY,"Well uh, whatever you can do. Thanks."
S07E22,[Yankee Stadium,George's Office]
S07E22,GEORGE,"(hesitant) Uh, Mr Wilhelm. Uh, about the project..."
S07E22,WILHELM,That's what I came to talk to you about. Great job George. (shakes George's hand) You really nailed it.
S07E22,GEORGE,I did?
S07E22,WILHELM,"Oh yes, I read through it this morning. I couldn't have done it better myself, and I turned it right over to Mr Steinbrenner. Good work George."
S07E22,JERRY,"I don't get it. He assigns it to you, you don't do it. Somehow it gets done, and now he's telling you what a great job you did."
S07E22,GEORGE,"Maybe somebody did it and didn't take credit for it. Maybe it was already done and didn't need doing in the first place. I have no idea who did it, what they did, or how they did it so well. And you know what? Jimmy crack corn and I don't care."
S07E22,WILHELM,"The gardener did a nice job planting the rose bushes, didn't he dear?"
S07E22,MRS WILHELM (O.C.),"You planted the rose bushes, dear."
S07E22,WILHELM,I did?
S07E22,MRS WILHELM (O.C.),Yesterday. You remember.
S07E22,WILHELM,(thinks for a moment) That's right. (pause) What's for dinner?
S07E22,MRS WILHELM (O.C.),We just ate. Did you forget to take your medicine?
S07E22,GEORGE,"The point is, however it got done, it's done. So, any luck with the car?"
S07E22,JERRY,No. The police have no leads (sitting on the couch arm) and I just found out today my insurance doesn't cover it.
S07E22,GEORGE,Why not?
S07E22,JERRY,"They don't consider it stolen, if you wilfully give the guy the keys."
S07E22,ELAINE,(to George) Hey.
S07E22,GEORGE,Hey.
S07E22,ELAINE,(to Jerry) Hey. What did the detective say?
S07E22,JERRY,They're looking.
S07E22,GEORGE,I gotta go.
S07E22,JERRY,Y'hello.
S07E22,DETECTIVE (V.O.),Mr Seinfeld?
S07E22,JERRY,Yeah.
S07E22,DETECTIVE (V.O.),It's Detective McMahon...
S07E22,DETECTIVE (V.O.),"...I'm at the warehouse on Pier 38. Ah, I think you'd better get down here."
S07E22,JERRY,"Yeah, okay. (to Elaine) They may have found the car."
S07E22,ELAINE,(makes surprise noise) Are the clubs in it? Ask him.
S07E22,JERRY,Are there golf clubs in the back?
S07E22,DETECTIVE (V.O.),We really can't tell. You better bring your service records.
S07E22,YOUNG COP,"Watch where you step. There's quite a bit of... grease. Detective, Jerry Seinfeld is here."
S07E22,DETECTIVE,How d'you do. Thanks for coming down.
S07E22,JERRY,(indicating) This is Elaine Benes.
S07E22,ELAINE,"(explaining) We used to date, but now we're just friends."
S07E22,DETECTIVE,I see.
S07E22,JERRY,Yeah.
S07E22,DETECTIVE,"I'm sorry to make you go through this, but we need to make sure."
S07E22,JERRY,"Well, what's going on? What is this thing?"
S07E22,DETECTIVE,One of our patrolmen stumbled over this.
S07E22,ELAINE,(horrified) Huuh! (she turns away and covers her mouth)
S07E22,JERRY,Oh my God!
S07E22,DETECTIVE,The block is nearly split apart. We found the overhead cams thirty feet away. We can only hope the body sold for scrap.
S07E22,ELAINE,"Oh, my God."
S07E22,DETECTIVE,And we know it's a Saab. The angle on the Vee-6 is definitely ninety-two. The model is hard to determine because the drive train is all burnt out.
S07E22,JERRY,What is that smell?
S07E22,DETECTIVE,Look at the clutch.
S07E22,ELAINE,Uuh.

S07E22,DETECTIVE,"Whoever did this didn't just dismantle it. I mean, they took their time, they had fun. They were very systematic. They went out of their way to gouge the sides of every piston, and the turbo was separated from the housing and shoved right up the exhaust pipe."
S07E22,ELAINE,Uhh
S07E22,JERRY,Wait a second. Turbo? I didn't have a turbo.
S07E22,DETECTIVE,Your car's not a turbo?
S07E22,JERRY,"No, it's a nine-hundred S. (happy) It's a turbo, Elaine, a turbo!"
S07E22,ELAINE,(sobbing happiness) It's a tu-hur-bo.
S07E22,WOMAN,"Excuse me, did you say turbo? Saab turbo nine-thousand? Is it... (voice breaking) midnight blue?"
S07E22,DETECTIVE,(condolences) Yes ma'am.
S07E22,KRAMER/NEWMAN,"(singing) Nine thousand, nine hundred and ninety-nine bottle and cans in the trunk, nine thousand, nine hundred and ninety-nine bottles and cans. At ten cents a bottle and ten cents a can, we're pulling in five hundred dollars a man. Nine thousand, nine hundred and ninety-eight bottle and cans in the trunk, nine thousand, nine hundred and ninety-eight bottles and cans. We fill up with gas, we count up our cash!!..."
S07E22,JERRY,Hello.
S07E22,TONY,"Hey Jerry, it's Tony."
S07E22,JERRY,"Tony, where are you?"
S07E22,TONY,"Aw look, I just want you to know that the car is fine. I got her all fixed up. We're in a nice area, no potholes, no traffic. So there's nothing to worry about. Okay? In fact, here, somebody wants to talk to you."
S07E22,JERRY,"Tony, y-you better bring that car back!"
S07E22,TONY,"(angry) Nobody's giving anything back! You tried to take it from me, I don't forget that."
S07E22,JERRY,"Tony, it is my car, and I want it back!"
S07E22,TONY,"Oh, your car. You want your car back!"
S07E22,JERRY,Tony.
S07E22,TONY,"Listen, that registration may have your name on it, Jerry. But this engine's running on my sweat and my blood."
S07E22,JERRY,(exasperated) Where do I find these guys?
S07E22,NEWMAN,How much gas we got?
S07E22,KRAMER,Three quarters of a tank.
S07E22,KRAMER,That's better than we estimated.
S07E22,NEWMAN,(smugly) That is seven dollars and twenty-two cents better.
S07E22,NEWMAN,"Maybe we could uh, stop for a snack."
S07E22,KRAMER,"Ah, no, that's not in the budget."
S07E22,NEWMAN,"Yeah well, the budget changed, you know. I mean, it might be a good investment."
S07E22,KRAMER,"That's not a good investment, that's a loss."
S07E22,KRAMER,"Hey, d'you see that car? Looks like Jerry's. I'm gonna check out that license plate."
S07E22,KRAMER,"Yeah, those are New York plates."
S07E22,NEWMAN,Is that Jerry's number?
S07E22,KRAMER,"I don't know, but that's New York and we're in Ohio. Those are pretty good odds."
S07E22,NEWMAN,What're you doing?
S07E22,KRAMER,I'm calling Jerry.
S07E22,NEWMAN,On what?
S07E22,KRAMER,Brought my phone.
S07E22,JERRY,(answering phone) Y'hello.
S07E22,KRAMER,"Yeah, hey Jerry, what's your licence plate number?"
S07E22,JERRY,"Why, what's up?"
S07E22,KRAMER,"Yeah, well I think I spotted your car."
S07E22,JERRY,"Oh my god, you're kidding. (dives for his wallet) Hang on a second. (reading from his registration) It's JVN 728."
S07E22,KRAMER,"(checks the car ahead of him) Hey, that's it! That's it. Hey, uh look, we got him. We're driving right behind him in a truck."
S07E22,JERRY,"Oh my god. Yeah, yeah, he said he brought it to the country."
S07E22,KRAMER,Well we're in the country and we're right on his tail.
S07E22,JERRY,"Good work Kramer, this is incredible."
S07E22,KRAMER,"Yeah, don't worry Jerry. We're right on this guy like stink on a monkey! I'll check back with you."
S07E22,ELAINE,Elaine Benes.
S07E22,JERRY,"Yeah, it's me. Kramer found the car!"
S07E22,ELAINE,"Oh my god, where is it?"
S07E22,JERRY,"It's somewhere in the country, they're following 'em."
S07E22,ELAINE,Are the clubs there?
S07E22,JERRY,I don't know. They're tailing him. I'm waiting for them to call me back.
S07E22,ELAINE,"Alright, I'm heading over right now."
S07E22,ELAINE,What's the status?
S07E22,JERRY,"Last check-in, they were still on him."
S07E22,ELAINE,"Well, have they called the police yet?"
S07E22,JERRY,"No, they won't call the police."
S07E22,ELAINE,What? Why not?
S07E22,JERRY,They're afraid they'll get in trouble for misusing a mail truck. Kramer doesn't want a record.
S07E22,ELAINE,Kramer has a record.
S07E22,JERRY,Not a Federal record.
S07E22,ELAINE/JERRY,Kramer?
S07E22,JERRY,What's going on?
S07E22,KRAMER,"Yeah, nothing. We're still following him."
S07E22,KRAMER,"Wait a second, he's getting off. Yeah, he's gonna be going south on the one-thirty-five."
S07E22,ELAINE,Keep following him.
S07E22,KRAMER,"Alright, alright, I'll follow him."
S07E22,NEWMAN,"Hey, we can't follow him, we're going north to Michigan."
S07E22,KRAMER,"Yeah, hey listen, I can't. It's gonna be taking us out of our way."
S07E22,ELAINE,I need those clubs.
S07E22,JERRY,"Kramer, I want my car."
S07E22,KRAMER,"Well, I don't know what to do."
S07E22,NEWMAN,"Hey, we got ten thousand deposit bottles here. I mean, this guy could be going to Arkansas."
S07E22,JERRY,Keep following him Kramer. don't let me down.
S07E22,NEWMAN,"Hey, don't listen to him. I mean, we can't afford a detour. Our budget won't hold it."
S07E22,KRAMER,"Well, I don't know what to do man!"
S07E22,NEWMAN,"Kramer! Stay left. Left, left, left."
S07E22,ELAINE/JERRY,Right. Go right!/South!
S07E22,KRAMER,Alright! Alright. I'm getting off! I'm gonna go on the ramp.
S07E22,NEWMAN,I hope you realise what you've done. You've destroyed our whole venture.
S07E22,KRAMER,This ramp is steep.
S07E22,NEWMAN,"All my work, my planning, my genius. All for nought."
S07E22,KRAMER,"Alright, look, we're pulling too much weight. He's getting away from us here. (indicating) Take the wheel."
S07E22,NEWMAN,What're you doing?
S07E22,KRAMER,(climbing though into the back of the truck) I'm gonna get something.
S07E22,NEWMAN,Are you crazy?
S07E22,KRAMER,Keep your foot on the gas.
S07E22,NEWMAN,"Hey! You're not dumping those bottles back there, are you?"
S07E22,NEWMAN,"Hey Kramer, those have wholesale value! We could cut our losses."

S07E22,STEINBRENNER,"They're gonna take you away to a nice place where you can get some help. They're very friendly people there. My brother-in-law was there for a couple of weeks. The man was obsessed with lactating women. They completely cured him, although he still eats a lot of cheese."
S07E22,GEORGE,"Ah, see, Mister.. I didn't write that report. That, that's not mine."
S07E22,STEINBRENNER,Of course you didn't George. Of course you didn't write it.

S07E23,BETH,(Laughing) Well where ever you are i appreciate it.
S07E23,JERRY,So how did this all happen?
S07E23,BETH,"Well actually, it had a lot to do with George's comment."
S07E23,JERRY,(stunned) Is that right?
S07E23,BETH,I thought maybe i could do better.
S07E23,JERRY,"Maybe, maybe"
S07E23,BETH,"Well it wasn't just that, i realized after 3 years of marriage that David's little quirks were getting on my nerves a little."
S07E23,JERRY,(agreeing) well three years is a long time to be married.
S07E23,BETH,"Like in the middle of our fight last night he did this thing that he always does where he asks questions to himself, aloud. And then answers them."
S07E23,DAVID,Am I happy Beth left me? Of course not. Do I hope to pick up the pieces and move on? Absolutely
S07E23,ELAINE,You're gonna pick up the pieces.

S07E24,GEORGE,He..hmmm. humm...What about this one.
S07E24,CLERK,"Hmmm,..to tell you the truth they haven't manufactured that one for a number of years. I might have couple of boxes left in our warehouse in New Jersey. I'd have to check."
S07E24,SUSAN,Oh! no. George that's so ugly we don't want that.
S07E24,GEORGE,What's the difference you just read it and mail it right back. These we'll do.
S07E24,SUSAN,Why don't they make'em anymore?
S07E24,CLERK,Well.. For one thing the glue isn't very adhesive. It takes a lot of moisture to make them stick.
S07E24,GEORGE,So we pick up some (word missing)

S07E24,JERRY,Aagh! You come back for your clothes
S07E24,GEORGE,I'm not going back in there.
S07E24,JERRY,So forget about your clothes.
S07E24,GEORGE,Well I'm not starting up a whole new wardrobe now!!!
S07E24,JERRY,"Look, freedom with no clothes is a lot better than no freedom with clothes."
S07E24,GEORGE,If she'd just take a plane somewhere.
S07E24,JERRY,"And what, hope for a crash?"
S07E24,GEORGE,It happens.
S07E24,JERRY,You know what the odds are on a crash it's a million to one.

S07E24,ELAINE,You don't ask.. You tell.
S07E24,GEORGE,"( to Jerry) What about the letter, should I think about the letter?"
S07E24,JERRY,Hey Elaine if a guy wanted to end a relationship with you . What could he do?
S07E24,ELAINE,Start smoking.
S07E24,GEORGE,Smoking.
S07E24,JERRY,Does she hate cigarettes?
S07E24,GEORGE,"Yes, she hates cigarettes."
S07E24,JERRY,But you don't smoke.
S07E24,GEORGE,Nooooooo......
S07E24,JERRY,"You know, I think I'm getting a little depressed about George's wedding."
S07E24,ELAINE,Really?
S07E24,JERRY,"Yeah. Well once he gets married that's it, she'll probably get pregnant, they'll move to Westchester. I'll never see him again."
S07E24,ELAINE,Yeah! You're probably right.
S07E24,JERRY,"Then it'll just be me, you and Kramer."
S07E24,ELAINE,No! Not me pal. I can't keep this up much longer. I'm sick of being single. I'm getting out.
S07E24,JERRY,So it's just gonna be me and Kramer.
S07E24,ELAINE,Yep! just you and Kramer.
S07E24,JERRY,See you ... me and Kramer...
S07E24,KRAMER,"Hey!! Buddy. I thought of a great invention for driving. A periscope in a car, so you can see the traffic."
S07E24,JERRY,(annoyed) How you gonna drive when looking through a periscope? Besides it's not a submarine and there's no room for a periscope in a car.
S07E24,KRAMER,Huh! You make a higher roof.
S07E24,JERRY,They're not making higher roofs.
S07E24,KRAMER,why can't you make a higher roof.
S07E24,JERRY,"Because it's a stupid idea. No one's gonna go for it. Don't you understand It's stupid ,stupid..."
S07E24,JERRY,".....Stupid , stupid."
S07E24,JEANNIE,"Hey! Hey! Look out. (she pulls him back saving his life.) OK!, Are you okay?"
S07E24,JERRY,Yeah!.. Thanks.Oh! my god you saved my life.
S07E24,JEANNIE,Shouldn't there be some kind of reward for that.
S07E24,JERRY,oh! thank you.
S07E24,JEANNIE,"You know you should be a lot more careful crossing the street like that, otherwise you could die.. If that bothers you."
S07E24,JERRY,Well I...
S07E24,JEANNIE,You see..(points to his collar) To me this is a waste.
S07E24,JERRY,What?
S07E24,JEANNIE,"The shirt you got on under your sweather. It sits for three weeks in your drawer, waiting to come out. and when it finally does . It sticks up only half an inch out of your collar."

S07E24,GEORGE,Listen I was talking to Elaine today and she said she'd would really like to be an usher at the wedding
S07E24,SUSAN,"No. Out of the question. I don't want any women ushers at my wedding and while we're on the subject, Kramer is not an usher either."
S07E24,GEORGE,Why not?
S07E24,SUSAN,He doesn't even know my name.
S07E24,GEORGE,That was an honest mistake.
S07E24,SUSAN,Nah! He's too weird he'd fall or something. He'd ruin the whole ceremony.
S07E24,GEORGE,Yeah! You're right.. You're probably right.
S07E24,SUSAN,Whadda doing?
S07E24,GEORGE,(shrugs and lights it up)

S07E24,SUSAN,I've never seen you smoke.
S07E24,GEORGE,"Oh yeeah.. well , Big smoker... I (coughs some more) gave it up for a while but it was too tough. Y' know.....I got no will power."
S07E24,SUSAN,I don't like this one bit.
S07E24,GEORGE,Well(coughs) I can't stop now...(coughs) I'm addicted...
S07E24,SUSAN,Well you are gonna have to quit.
S07E24,GEORGE,Oh my god....

S07E24,JERRY,Uh! Really .That's nice.
S07E24,KRAMER,Now what's with you?
S07E24,JERRY,I think I'm in love.
S07E24,KRAMER,Oh. Come on.
S07E24,JERRY,No it's true. This woman saved my life. I was crossing the street .I was almost hit by a car...and then we talked and.......the whole thing just seemed like a dream.
S07E24,KRAMER,If a guy saved your life you'd be in love with him too.
S07E24,JERRY,"No, no this woman is different , she's incredible. she's just like me. She talks like me, she acts like me. She even ordered cereal at a restaurant. We even have the same initials. Wait a minute, I just realised what's going on."
S07E24,KRAMER,What?
S07E24,JERRY,Now I know what I've been looking for all these years......myself! (Kramer is speechless) I've been waiting for me to come along and now I 've swept myself off my feet.
S07E24,KRAMER,You stop it man.. you're FREAKING ME OUT!!!
S07E24,KRAMER,Hey!
S07E24,TELLER,Hey!
S07E24,KRAMER,Hey! wait a second. You didn't say hello.
S07E24,TELLER,Yes I did

S07E24,TELLER,"No, No I said Hello."
S07E24,KRAMER,"No, No You said Hey!"
S07E24,TELLER,"Well.. Hey! is Hello, same thing."
S07E24,KRAMER,The add said that the bank's gonna pay a hundred dollars if you are not greeted with a hello
S07E24,TELLER,"You're taking that much to literally. Now sir , do you have any business to transact."
S07E24,KRAMER,"No, I want to speak to the manager."
S07E24,TELLER,"Well, He's not here right now."
S07E24,KRAMER,Then I'll be back.
S07E24,ELAINE,So I'm not gonna be an usher?
S07E24,GEORGE,No..
S07E24,ELAINE,"So I'm nothing. Jerry is best man , Kramer is an usher and I am nothing."
S07E24,GEORGE,Well Kramer's not an usher anymore.
S07E24,KRAMER,What are you talking about?
S07E24,GEORGE,You've been demoted.
S07E24,KRAMER,Why?
S07E24,GEORGE,Because you called her by the wrong name.
S07E24,KRAMER,But she really looks like a Lily
S07E24,ELAINE,"Jerry ( as they come into the apt.) Jerry, Susan says I can't be an usher at he wedding."
S07E24,KRAMER,Yeah. me neither.
S07E24,JERRY,(shrugs) Hey George I think I want to bring a date to the wedding
S07E24,GEORGE,Who!!?
S07E24,JERRY,"I just met her, she's incredible."
S07E24,ELAINE,Aaawh...This is GREAT!!.....Now I'm gonna be stuck at the singles table with all the losers.
S07E24,JERRY,You can go with Kramer
S07E24,KRAMER,"No , no no no no. Weddings are a great place to meet chicks. I have to be unfettered."
S07E24,GEORGE,Do you see what this is turning in to? Do I need this. I have to get out of this thing.
S07E24,ELAINE,Did you try the cigarettes?
S07E24,GEORGE,Yeah.. They made me sick.
S07E24,KRAMER,"All right, All right. Lets get down here. You really want to get out of this thing ?"
S07E24,GEORGE,Yeah...
S07E24,KRAMER,All right. I got two words for you; Pre-Nup.
S07E24,GEORGE,What does that mean?
S07E24,KRAMER,Ask her to sign a pre-nup.
S07E24,GEORGE,What does that do?
S07E24,KRAMER,Because most women when they're asked to sign a pre-nup are so offended they back out of the marriage.
S07E24,GEORGE,They are?... Elaine?
S07E24,ELAINE,I wouldn't sign one.
S07E24,GEORGE,Pre-nup of course ..Kramer....

S07E24,DOCTOR,"Excuse me , Are you the husband?"
S07E24,GEORGE,"Well , not yet.. Fianc."
S07E24,DOCTOR,"Well , I'm sorry.....She's gone."
S07E24,GEORGE,.........What's that?...

S07E24,DOCTOR,"Yes , of course."
S07E24,GEORGE,So.....She's dead?
S07E24,DOCTOR,Yes
S07E24,GEORGE,...Huh!
S07E24,DOCTOR,Let me ask you ; Had she been exposed to any kind of inexpensive glue?
S07E24,GEORGE,...Why?
S07E24,DOCTOR,We found traces of a certain toxic adhesive commonly found in very low priced envelopes.
S07E24,GEORGE,Well she was sending out our wedding invitations.
S07E24,DOCTOR,That's probably what did it.
S07E24,GEORGE,"We were expecting about two hundred people...Well...Thank you , thank you."
S07E24,GEORGE,She's ahem....gone
S07E24,JERRY,Dead?
S07E24,ELAINE,I'm so sorry George
S07E24,JERRY,Yeah! me too
S07E24,KRAMER,Poor Lily..
S07E24,JERRY,How did it happen?
S07E24,GEORGE,Apparently the glue in the wedding invitations was a....toxic.
S07E24,ALL,Aah!..
S07E24,KRAMER,Well that's weird
S07E24,JERRY,"So I guess , you're not getting married?"
S07E24,GEORGE,(embarrassed with a touch of unrestrained jubilation) Yes.
S07E24,JERRY,But....
S07E24,GEORGE,Yeah?
S07E24,JERRY,"Well , now I'm engaged.."
S07E24,GEORGE,Yeah?...
S07E24,JERRY,Well I thought we'd both be getting married.
S07E24,GEORGE,Hey!.. What can I tell ya.
S07E24,ELAINE,All right. (they start to leave except Jerry)
S07E24,GEORGE,well humm.. lets get some coffee.
S07E24,JERRY,WE HAD A PACT!!!
S07E24,GEORGE,"Yes I'd like to speak to Marisa Tomei, please? Marisa, Hi it's George Costanza.. I'm the short, funny, quirky bald man you met a little while ago, heh! yeah I was just calling 'cos I wanted you to know that I'm not engaged anymore......well huh, She died....Toxic glue from the wedding invitations.....well we were expecting about two hundred people. Yeah... Anyway.. hum I got the funeral tomorrow but huh.. my weekend is pretty wide open and I was wondering... (dial tone interrupts George)..... Hello...Hello.."
S08E01,GEORGE,Well... it's a magnificent stone.
S08E01,MR. ROSS,They put it up this morning.
S08E01,GEORGE,It's just a magnificent stone. (turns to Jerry) Jerry?
S08E01,MRS. ROSS,George... we'll leave you alone with her.
S08E01,GEORGE,What?
S08E01,MRS. ROSS,I'm sure there are things you'd like to say.
S08E01,GEORGE,"No, I-I-I-I'm good. Really."
S08E01,GEORGE,Jerry...
S08E01,JERRY,"Thank you, no."
S08E01,GEORGE,"(to Susan's stone) ...And then, right after the All-Star Break, we, we just swept the Orioles. Four games. In Baltimore. (adjusts necktie nervously) So... yeah."
S08E01,GEORGE,"Boy, that was awkward!"
S08E01,JERRY,I don't mind the cemetery.
S08E01,GEORGE,"What were you saying to the Rosses over there, anyway?"
S08E01,JERRY,"Oh, I don't know. I told them her death takes place in the shadow of new life. She's not really dead if we find a way to remember her."
S08E01,GEORGE,What is that?
S08E01,JERRY,Star Trek II.
S08E01,GEORGE,(identifying it) Wrath of Khan!
S08E01,JERRY,"Right. Kramer and I saw it last night. Spock dies, they wrap him up in a towel, and they shoot him out the bowel of the ship in that big sunglasses case."
S08E01,GEORGE,That was a hell of a thing when Spock died...
S08E01,JERRY,Yeah...
S08E01,GEORGE,"Well anyway, the, uh... the stone is up, I paid my respects, guess that's it."
S08E01,JERRY,So it's over?
S08E01,GEORGE,"I have mourned for three long months! Summer months, too! Anybody could grieve in January! It's time for George to start being George again."
S08E01,JERRY,"All right, so uh, let's do something later. How 'bout a movie?"
S08E01,GEORGE,Yes! Nothing says George like a movie!
S08E01,KRAMER,Movie?
S08E01,JERRY,"Yeah, you in?"
S08E01,KRAMER,"No, no, no, I can't. I got my martial arts class."
S08E01,GEORGE,George is going to the movies! (exits)
S08E01,JERRY,(to Kramer) So how's your karate class going?
S08E01,KRAMER,"(pronouncing it ""kar-ah-tay"") Karate, Jerry. Karate. The lifetime pursuit of balance and harmony."
S08E01,JERRY,...But with punching and kicking.
S08E01,KRAMER,"Jerry, karate is not here (pointing to the ground). It's here (points to head), and here (points to chest), and here (makes a circle with his hands)."
S08E01,JERRY,"Alright, I gotta go to the airport to pick up Elaine."
S08E01,KRAMER,"What, she's been away?"
S08E01,JERRY,She's been in Mexico for six weeks.
S08E01,KRAMER,"No, I really think you're wrong. We just went to the fireworks the other day."
S08E01,JERRY,That was July 4th!
S08E01,JERRY,"Alright, I'm outta here, and when I get back, I don't want to see you here (points to kitchen), here (points to living room), or here (makes similar circle with his hands)."
S08E01,ELAINE,It was unbelievable. Six weeks of traveling through Mexico all on Peterman's peso.
S08E01,JERRY,Wow. So did you get any good ideas for the catalog?
S08E01,ELAINE,"Oh, tons!"
S08E01,JERRY,Anything you couldn't have gotten tearing open a bag of Doritos and watching Viva Zapata?
S08E01,ELAINE,"(laughs sarcastically) You don't respect my work at all, do you?"
S08E01,JERRY,"No, I don't."
S08E01,ELAINE,So what's been going on around this dump? How's your fiancee?
S08E01,JERRY,My what?
S08E01,ELAINE,Jeannie... your fiancee.
S08E01,JERRY,"Oh, yeah, that. Well..."
S08E01,ELAINE,"All right. Spill it, Jerome."
S08E01,JERRY,There's really not that much to tell.
S08E01,JERRY & JEANNIE,(simultaneously) I hate you!
S08E01,JEANNIE,See ya.
S08E01,JERRY,See ya.
S08E01,JERRY,"(continuing) No rejection, no guilt, no remorse."
S08E01,ELAINE,You've never felt remorse.
S08E01,JERRY,"I know, I feel bad about that..."
S08E01,ELAINE,"I bet your parents were upset, huh?"
S08E01,JERRY,Eh.
S08E01,ELAINE,"You haven't told them yet, have you?"
S08E01,JERRY,No.
S08E01,DUGAN,"""So I pressed through the rushes, there below me, the shimmering waters of Lake Victoria..."""
S08E01,J. PETERMAN,"Oh, for the love of God, man! Just tell me what the product is."
S08E01,Dugan,"It's a, uh, washcloth."
S08E01,J. PETERMAN,No washcloths!
S08E01,ELAINE,"Well, Mr. Peterman, I've got a really good idea for a hat. It combines the spirit of old Mexico with a little big city panache. I like to call it the Urban Sombrero."
S08E01,J. PETERMAN,"(rubbing his neck) Oh, my neck is one gargantuan monkey fist."
S08E01,ELAINE,"Are you okay, Mr. Peterman?"
S08E01,J. PETERMAN,"Yes, yes. Go on, go on, go on."
S08E01,ELAINE,"Well, see, it's... businessmen taking siestas. You know, it's the, uh, the Urban Sombrero."
S08E01,ELAINE,Mr. Peterman?
S08E01,GEORGE,"(inhales deeply) I tell you, Jerry, I'm feeling something. Something I haven't felt in a long time."
S08E01,JERRY,Pride?
S08E01,GEORGE,"No. Autonomy, complete and total autonomy."
S08E01,JERRY,"Well, you're your own boss now."
S08E01,GEORGE,I wanna go to a tractor pull.
S08E01,JERRY,Go ahead.
S08E01,GEORGE,I am staying out all night!
S08E01,JERRY,Who's stopping you?
S08E01,GEORGE,"I wanna bite into a big hunk of cheese, just bite into it like it's an apple."
S08E01,JERRY,Whatever.
S08E01,JERRY,Oh God.
S08E01,GEORGE,What?
S08E01,JERRY,It's Dolores.
S08E01,GEORGE,Who?
S08E01,JERRY,Mulva.
S08E01,DOLORES,"Jerry, hi."
S08E01,JERRY,"Hi, Dolores. George, you remember Dolores?"
S08E01,GEORGE,Dolores!
S08E01,DOLORES,Hi. (to Jerry) I heard you got engaged.
S08E01,JERRY,"Yes, Dolores, I did. It didn't work out, though, Dolores."
S08E01,DOLORES,"Oh, that's too bad. You know... we should get together sometime. See ya."
S08E01,JERRY,See ya.
S08E01,GEORGE,"Bye, Dolores."
S08E01,GEORGE,I thought Mulva hated you.
S08E01,JERRY,"Yeah, so did I. You know what? I bet it was the engagement. I've shown I can go all the way."
S08E01,GEORGE,All the way?
S08E01,JERRY,"Not our ""all the way"", their ""all the way."" I got the stink of responsibility on me."
S08E01,GEORGE,"Yeah, and you were engaged for like a minute, I was engaged for a year."
S08E01,JERRY,You stink worse than I do!
S08E01,GEORGE,"I'm feeling something else here, Jerry!"
S08E01,SECRETARY,"Elaine, it's Mr. Peterman on the phone."
S08E01,ELAINE,"(answers the phone) Hello, Mr. Peterman, how are you feeling?"
S08E01,J. PETERMAN,"Elaine, I'll be blunt. I'm burnt out. I'm fried. My mind is as barren as the surface of the moon. I can run that catalog no longer."
S08E01,ELAINE,"What? Well, who's gonna do it?"
S08E01,J. PETERMAN,What about you?
S08E01,ELAINE,Me? Why me?
S08E01,J. PETERMAN,"Why, indeed."
S08E01,ELAINE,"Mr. Peterman, you can't leave."
S08E01,J. PETERMAN,"I've already left, Elaine. I'm in Burma."
S08E01,ELAINE,Burma?
S08E01,J. PETERMAN,"You most likely know it as Myanmar, but it will always be Burma to me. Bonne chance, Elaine. (to a passerby) You there on the motorbike! Sell me one of your melons! (runs after him)"
S08E01,ELAINE,Mr. Peterman?
S08E01,JERRY,Where?
S08E01,ELAINE,Burma.
S08E01,JERRY,Isn't it Myanmar now?
S08E01,ELAINE,"Jerry, he wants me to run the catalog! It's crazy! I can't be in charge!"
S08E01,JERRY,"No, certainly not."
S08E01,ELAINE,"I mean, I can't give people orders!"
S08E01,JERRY,No one's gonna listen to you.
S08E01,ELAINE,I am not qualified to run the catalog!
S08E01,JERRY,You're not qualified to work at the catalog.
S08E01,KRAMER,Hey. (notices Elaine) What's wrong?
S08E01,ELAINE,"Oh, Peterman ran off to Burma, and now he wants me to run the catalog."
S08E01,KRAMER,Where?
S08E01,JERRY,Myanmar.
S08E01,KRAMER,The discount pharmacy?
S08E01,ELAINE,"Well, I'm just gonna tell him no. I can't run the catalog."
S08E01,KRAMER,"Whoa, whoa. Can't? When did that word enter your vocabulary? What, is the job too difficult? (Jerry nods) What, you don't have enough experience? (Jerry shakes his head) Oh, you're not smart enough? (Jerry shakes his head) Where's your confidence? (Jerry shrugs his shoulders) Look, Elaine, let me tell you a story. When I first studied karate..."
S08E01,ELAINE,Karate?
S08E01,KRAMER,"Yeah, karate. I had no support. Not from him, not from Newman, no one. The first time I sparred with an opponent, I was terrified. My legs, they were like noodles. But then I looked inside, and I found my katra."
S08E01,ELAINE,Katra?
S08E01,KRAMER,"Yeah, your spirit, your, uh, being. The part of you that says, ""Yes, I can!"""
S08E01,JERRY,Sammy Davis had it.
S08E01,KRAMER,So I listened to my katra and now <vreep> I'm dominating the dojo. I'm class champion.
S08E01,ELAINE,"Well, you know, I, I have watched Peterman run the company."
S08E01,KRAMER,Sure you have.
S08E01,ELAINE,"I know how to do it. Pair of pants, a stupid story, a huge markup. I can do that."
S08E01,KRAMER,"You follow your katra, and you can do anything. (leads her to the door) Now get out of here."
S08E01,ELAINE,(excitedly) Okay.
S08E01,KRAMER,That kid is gonna be all right.
S08E01,JERRY,"No, she's not."
S08E01,JOEY,"Come on, Kramer!"
S08E01,KRAMER,Hey there.
S08E01,JOEY,Come on. Mom's down in the car.
S08E01,KRAMER,"Okay, Joey."
S08E01,JERRY,You guys both have class at the same time?
S08E01,KRAMER,"No, we're in the same class."
S08E01,JERRY,What do you mean you're in the same class?
S08E01,KRAMER,He almost beat me.
S08E01,JERRY,"Kramer, you're fighting children?!"
S08E01,KRAMER,"We're all at the same skill level, Jerry."
S08E01,JERRY,"He's nine years old! You don't need karate, you can just wring his neck!"
S08E01,KRAMER,I got carpool. (exits)
S08E01,KRAMER,"Thanks for the juice box, Mrs. Z."
S08E01,JOEY,"Hey, could we stop for ice cream on the way home, mom?"
S08E01,MRS. ZANFINO,"Mmm, I don't know..."
S08E01,MRS. ZANFINO,All right.
S08E01,KIDS & KRAMER,Yay!
S08E01,DUGAN,*You're* taking the job?
S08E01,ELAINE,"You got that straight. Now I want four new ideas from each of you by 600. No, make that six ideas by 400. All right, let's move, move, move, move, move!"
S08E01,SANSEI,Are you prepared for kumite?
S08E01,KRAMER & JOEY,"Yes, Sansei."
S08E01,SANSEI,Fight stance.
S08E01,SANSEI,Hydjama! Begin!
S08E01,SANSEI,(raising Kramer's arm) Winner!
S08E01,GEORGE,It's open!
S08E01,GEORGE,(surprised) Rosses.
S08E01,MRS. ROSS,"Hello, George."
S08E01,GEORGE,"Well, uh... come in, come, come in. (frantically clears the couch of newspapers and crumbs)"
S08E01,MR. ROSS,"We, uh, tried to call, but the line was busy."
S08E01,GEORGE,"Oh. Oh. Yeah, sure. Here. Uh, sit down. Uh, uh, cheese, there? (he grabs a suit jacket from the desk chair and puts it on)"
S08E01,MRS. ROSS,We know the last three months have been hard on you.
S08E01,GEORGE,"Oh, yes, yes, yes. Very, very hard."
S08E01,MR. ROSS,"And they've been hard on us, too. It's a terrible tragedy when parents outlive their children."
S08E01,GEORGE,"Yes, I agree. I hope my parents go long before I do."
S08E01,MR. ROSS,That's why we decided to create a foundation to preserve Susan's memory.
S08E01,GEORGE,"Oh, that's wonderful."
S08E01,MR. ROSS,"And, of course, we want you to be an integral part."
S08E01,GEORGE,"Yes, inte-- h-how inte-- how integral?"
S08E01,MR. ROSS,You'll be on the board of directors.
S08E01,GEORGE,"(feigning excitement) Great, great. O-Oh, oh, oh, gosh. You know, it's just... my duties with the Yankees..."
S08E01,MRS. ROSS,"Don't worry, George. The foundation will revolve around your schedule. Evenings, weekends, whenever you have free time."
S08E01,GEORGE,I can't believe this is happening.
S08E01,MR. ROSS,"Well, it wouldn't have without your friend Jerry's inspirational words. He said to us, ""She's not really dead if her shadow is..."" Uh, w-what was it, dear?"
S08E01,MRS. ROSS,"Something about a way, a-and a light, uh... ha. Who the hell knows?"
S08E01,MR. ROSS,"Well, what's important is that your relationship with Susan doesn't have to end."
S08E01,MRS. ROSS,So will you be sure to thank Jerry for us?
S08E01,GEORGE,(feigning happiness) The second I see him.
S08E01,JERRY,Hey.
S08E01,GEORGE,"Hey. How's your day, good?"
S08E01,JERRY,"Actually, yeah. I'm meeting Mulva here in a few minutes."
S08E01,GEORGE,"So uh... Wrath of Khan, huh?"
S08E01,JERRY,Yeah. Was that a beauty or what?
S08E01,GEORGE,What was that line again? Something about finding your way in a shadow?
S08E01,JERRY,"No, no, no, it's... ""She's not really dead if we find a way to remember her."""
S08E01,GEORGE,That's it. That's the line... (squirts mustard into Jerry's coffee and stirs it) ...that destroyed my life.
S08E01,JERRY,(stares into coffee cup and looks back at George) Problem?
S08E01,GEORGE,"The Rosses have started up a foundation, Jerry, and I have to sit on the board of directors."
S08E01,JERRY,"Hey, board of directors. Look at you!"
S08E01,GEORGE,"Yeah! Look at me! I was free and clear! I was living the dream! I was stripped to the waist, eating a block of cheese the size of a car battery!"
S08E01,JERRY,"Before we go any further, I'd just like to point out how disturbing it is that you equate eating a block of cheese with some sort of bachelor paradise."
S08E01,GEORGE,Don't you see? I'm back in.
S08E01,JERRY,All because of Wrath of Khan?
S08E01,GEORGE,Yes!
S08E01,JERRY,"Well, it was the best of those movies."
S08E01,GEORGE,KHAN!
S08E01,WYCK,George.
S08E01,WYCK,George. (taps him on the shoulder)
S08E01,GEORGE,(startled) Oh!
S08E01,WYCK,"I'm Wyck Thayer, chairman of the Susan Ross Foundation."
S08E01,GEORGE,Wink.
S08E01,WYCK,(correcting him) Wyck.
S08E01,GEORGE,Wyck.
S08E01,WYCK,"Now, as you know, the Rosses had considerable monies."
S08E01,GEORGE,Oh. I know they have some monies.
S08E01,WYCK,"They had more than some monies. Many, many monies. And they planned to give a sizable portion of their estate to you and Susan after the wedding."
S08E01,GEORGE,"So, if Susan and I had... I mean, if the envelopes hadn't, uh... then we--"
S08E01,WYCK,Yes.
S08E01,GEORGE,And now?
S08E01,WYCK,"Not. It's all been endowed to the foundation, even this townhouse."
S08E01,GEORGE,This townhouse?
S08E01,WYCK,This would have been your wedding gift.
S08E01,GEORGE,And now?
S08E01,WYCK,Not.
S08E01,GEORGE,Not.
S08E01,WYCK,Also endowed. George... I know how much Susan meant to you. It can't be easy.
S08E01,GEORGE,"You know, it really can't."
S08E01,DOLORES,So who broke it off?
S08E01,JERRY,"Well, that's the thing. It was completely mutual."
S08E01,DOLORES,"Oh, come on. Everybody knows there's no such thing as a mutual breakup. Tell me the truth."
S08E01,JERRY,I am. It was the world's first.
S08E01,DOLORES,"You know, when I heard you got engaged, I thought *maybe* you had matured. But obviously there's no growth here. (exits)"
S08E01,JERRY,"Well, I can't argue with that, but the fact remains... I was completely... (to himself, cursing her) Mulva!"
S08E01,JERRY,(answering) Hello?
S08E01,SECRETARY,Please hold for Elaine Benes.
S08E01,JERRY,"Oh, I don't believe this."
S08E01,ELAINE,(picking up) Jerry!
S08E01,JERRY,Hey!
S08E01,ELAINE,Hey. Guess who just finished laying out her first issue of the J. Peterman Catalog.
S08E01,JERRY,How's it look?
S08E01,ELAINE,"(muffled, as she's smoking a cigar) It's a peach."
S08E01,JERRY,Huh?
S08E01,ELAINE,"I say, it's a peach."
S08E01,JERRY,"Elaine, let me ask you something. When I told you my breakup was mutual, did you believe me?"
S08E01,ELAINE,"No, no, no. It's weak. No one's gonna buy it, and you shouldn't be selling it."
S08E01,JERRY,I gotta do some research here.
S08E01,ELAINE,"Hey, hey. Me. Talking. You know, between you and me, I always thought Kramer was a bit of a doofus, but he believed in me. *You* did not. So as I see it, he's not the doofus. *You* are the doofus."
S08E01,JERRY,"Oh, I'm the doofus?"
S08E01,ELAINE,"Yeah. You, Jerry, are the doofus."
S08E01,JERRY,"You know, it occurs to me that Kramer is at karate right now."
S08E01,ELAINE,"Oh, well, maybe I'll just go down there and thank him in person."
S08E01,JERRY,"Yeah, that's what I was thinking."
S08E01,ELAINE,Kramer!
S08E01,KRAMER,"Oh, hey."
S08E01,ELAINE,What are you doing?
S08E01,KRAMER,"Oh, well, I-I-I'm dominating."
S08E01,ELAINE,You never said you were fighting children.
S08E01,KRAMER,"Well, it's not the size of the opponent, Elaine, it's, uh, the ferocity."
S08E01,ELAINE,This is what you used to build me up? This is where you got all that stupid katra stuff?
S08E01,KRAMER,"No, no. That's from, uh, Star Trek III... The Search for Spock."
S08E01,ELAINE,Search... for Spock?!
S08E01,KRAMER,"Yeah, I know Jerry will tell you that The Wrath of Khan is the better picture, but for me, I always..."
S08E01,ELAINE,(pushes him) You doofus!
S08E01,JERRY,"Okay, question #8. What if I told you my fiancee left me for another man? Does that make me more likable, less likable, as likable? Let's start over here this time."
S08E01,WAITRESS #1,More.
S08E01,WAITRESS #2,Less.
S08E01,RUTHIE,Same.
S08E01,WILLIE,Are we about through here?
S08E01,KRAMER,I thought you said your mom was meeting us in the alley.
S08E01,JOEY,She had a little change of plans.
S08E01,KRAMER,"What's going on? Hey, Timmy, Clara. That was some kind of workout we had tonight, huh?"
S08E01,GIRL,Now we finish it.
S08E01,KRAMER,Aah! Aah! Mama!
S08E01,JERRY,"(on the phone) Dad, I wouldn't eat anything you caught in that pond out in front of the condo."
S08E01,JERRY,"Uh, look, Elaine's here, I gotta get going. Oh, by the way, uh, I'm not getting married. Tell mom. Bye. (hangs up)"
S08E01,JERRY,So... did you stop by the dojo?
S08E01,ELAINE,Yep.
S08E01,JERRY,How's your confidence level?
S08E01,ELAINE,Shot.
S08E01,JERRY,Self-esteem?
S08E01,ELAINE,Gone.
S08E01,JERRY,Doofus?
S08E01,ELAINE,(raises her hand) Yo.
S08E01,JERRY,"All right, so what? You put out the catalog. How bad could it be?"
S08E01,JERRY,What is that?
S08E01,ELAINE,It's the Urban Sombrero. I put it on the cover.
S08E01,JERRY,"Well, nobody sees the... cover."
S08E01,KRAMER,God!
S08E01,JERRY,What happened to you?
S08E01,KRAMER,Whew! I got whooped. You should have seen the rage in their little eyes. And those tiny little fists of fury. Oh. (notices the Urban Sombrero) What is that?
S08E01,JERRY,It's the new cover of the J. Peterman Catalog. It is Elaine's choice. Let's congratulate her.
S08E01,KRAMER,Oh I see. (Elaine walks up to him) Woof!
S08E01,ELAINE,(pointing a finger accusingly at Kramer) You! This is all your fault! You told me I could run the company!
S08E01,KRAMER,"Well, then I was way off!"
S08E01,ELAINE,"Well, I'll see ya... (exits)"
S08E01,JERRY,Vaya con dios.
S08E01,KRAMER,"(with his forehead in his hands) Man, I gotta go lay down. You and George going out a little later?"
S08E01,JERRY,"No, he's still stuck at the foundation."
S08E01,KRAMER,"You know, you oughta go down there and help him out. He's a widower."
S08E01,JERRY,Widower? Wait a second. (goes to a notebook of his research)
S08E01,WYCK,"Okay, let's see. The beachhouse. 48 acres... ooh. Southampton. That should fetch a fair price."
S08E01,GEORGE,Would I have had access to that?
S08E01,WYCK,"Of course, it would have been yours."
S08E01,GEORGE,And now?
S08E01,GEORGE,(anticipating the answer) Not.
S08E01,GEORGE,Hello?
S08E01,JERRY,"Hey, Georgie! I'm doing some research down at the coffee shop. Your story's the one."
S08E01,GEORGE,My story?
S08E01,JERRY,"Yeah, your widower story's tested through the roof. (various patrons give the thumbs up in approval) When are you getting out of there?"
S08E01,GEORGE,"Uh, excuse me, Wyck. Uh, are we, uh, almost done here?"
S08E01,WYCK,"(chuckling) Oh, no, not even close."
S08E01,GEORGE,(remorsefully) I can't go.
S08E01,JERRY,"What do you mean you can't go? There's two really girls sitting at the counter eating grilled cheese. Cheese, George! Cheese!"
S08E01,WYCK,"Okay, next item. Susan's doll collection. Estimated value $2.6 million. What do you say we go through this doll by doll?"
S08E02,GEORGE,You want me to find a poem about Susan? May she rest in peace?!
S08E02,WYCK,"Well, we think it would be a nice touch for the Foundation literature. Do you have a favorite poet, George?"
S08E02,GEORGE,"I like, uh...(mutters something unintelligible under his breath.)"
S08E02,WYCK,Pardon?
S08E02,GEORGE,(mutters it again)
S08E02,WYCK,"Well, you should choose the poem since you knew Susan best at the time of her unfortunate (clears his throat)...accident."
S08E02,JERRY,He cleared his throat?
S08E02,GEORGE,Yes!
S08E02,JERRY,So?
S08E02,GEORGE,"He did it right as he said ""her unfortunate accident."""
S08E02,JERRY,Not getting it.
S08E02,GEORGE,"Jerry, a throat-clear is a non-verbal implication of doubt - he thinks I killed Susan!"
S08E02,JERRY,"Oh, help me, Rhonda."
S08E02,GEORGE,What time is it?
S08E02,JERRY (looks at his watch),115.
S08E02,GEORGE,Right now?
S08E02,JERRY,I gotta go meet Pam.
S08E02,GEORGE,"Oh, the bookstore girl. How's that goin'?"
S08E02,JERRY,Okay. I'm just not ga-ga over her. For once I'd like to be ga-ga.
S08E02,GEORGE,Where's Elaine?
S08E02,JERRY,"She's having Carol, Gail and Lisa over. You know they all have kids now?"
S08E02,GEORGE,What's with all these people having babies?
S08E02,JERRY,Perpetuation of the species.
S08E02,GEORGE,Yeah! Right!
S08E02,JERRY,"By the way, just for the record -"
S08E02,GEORGE,"No, I did not! (They exit the coffee shop.)"
S08E02,CAROL,"...but because it comes out of your baby, it smells good!"
S08E02,ELAINE,"Well, that's...that's sweet."
S08E02,GAIL,Being a mother has made me feel so beautiful.
S08E02,CAROL,"Elaine, you gotta have a baby!"
S08E02,ELAINE,"Oh, hey, you know...I had a piece of whitefish over at Barney Greengrass the other day..."
S08E02,LISA,Elaine. Move to Long Island and have a baby already.
S08E02,ELAINE,I really like the city.
S08E02,CAROL,The city's a toilet. When's the last time you saw my little Adam?
S08E02,ELAINE,"Uh, it was in the Hamptons."
S08E02,CAROL,Oh! I have pictures!
S08E02,ELAINE,"No, no, that's okay, it's uh..."
S08E02,CAROL (shows Elaine and the girls pictures of Adam),Look at him! Just look at him!
S08E02,JERRY,"So, Elaine was telling me about this piece of whitefish she had the other day..."
S08E02,GEORGE,Do you really think I'm wrong about this Wyck guy?
S08E02,JERRY,"You know, if you really want to test him out, why don't you try the old Jerry Lewis trick?"
S08E02,GEORGE,Jerry Lewis?
S08E02,JERRY,"I heard that when Jerry Lewis left a meeting, he'd purposefully leave a briefcase with a tape recorder in it. Then after five minutes, he'd come back for it and listen to what everyone said about him."
S08E02,GEORGE,That's pretty paranoid.
S08E02,JERRY,"Yes, it is."
S08E02,GEORGE,I like it!
S08E02,JERRY,I thought you might.
S08E02,PAM,"Oh, hi! I'm Pam. You must be Kramer. (Kramer is smitten with Pam and grins goofily.) Jerry's told me a lot about you. (Kramer continues grinning.) Well, I'm supposed to meet Jerry, it's my day off. I work in a bookstore."
S08E02,KRAMER (mouths the words),Books. (Knocks over a bowl of fruit on the counter.)
S08E02,PAM,"Oh, careful! (Jerry enters.)"
S08E02,JERRY,"Hi, sorry I'm late."
S08E02,PAM,That's okay. Kramer let me in.
S08E02,JERRY,"You know, if we rush, we can still make the movie."
S08E02,PAM,Okay. (Touches Kramer's hand) It was really nice meeting you.
S08E02,KRAMER,"I'm in trouble, buddy. I just met a woman."
S08E02,NEWMAN,Go on.
S08E02,KRAMER,"Well, she's Jerry's girlfriend."
S08E02,NEWMAN,"Ah, yes. Forbidden love."
S08E02,KRAMER,She works in a book shop. Her name is Pam.
S08E02,NEWMAN,"""Pam."" I don't know the woman, but she sounds quite fetching."
S08E02,KRAMER,I can't even speak in front of her. (Sits down on the couch.)
S08E02,NEWMAN,Jerry! What could she possibly see in Jerry? (Walks in front of Kramer and trips over his feet.)
S08E02,KRAMER,She has delicate beauty.
S08E02,NEWMAN,Jerry wouldn't know delicate beauty if it bludgeoned him over the head.
S08E02,KRAMER,"And yet, he's my friend."
S08E02,NEWMAN,"And therein lies the tragedy. For I believe, sadly for you, that there is but one woman meant for each of us. One perfect angel for whom we are put on this earth."
S08E02,KRAMER,"Aw, that's beautiful, Newman."
S08E02,NEWMAN,"One winsome tulip we ceaselessly yearn for throughout our dreary, workaday lives! And you, my friend, have found your angel. I can tell. For my heart has also been captured by a breathless beauty - whom I fear I will never possess."
S08E02,KRAMER,I thought we were talking about me.
S08E02,NEWMAN,"Right. Kramer, you have to confront Jerry."
S08E02,KRAMER,Confront Jerry? I can't.
S08E02,NEWMAN,You must!
S08E02,KRAMER,I won't!
S08E02,NEWMAN,You will!
S08E02,"ELAINE (to Jerry, imitating Carol)","""Elaine, ya gotta have a baby."" Ugh."
S08E02,GEORGE,Where are all the poetry magazines?
S08E02,ELAINE,The New Yorker has poetry.
S08E02,GEORGE,Yes. The New Yorker.
S08E02,JERRY,Why do you invite these women over if they annoy you so much?
S08E02,ELAINE,"They're my friends, but they act as if having a baby takes some kind of talent."
S08E02,JERRY,"C'mon, you want to have a baby."
S08E02,ELAINE,Why? Because I can?
S08E02,JERRY,"It's the life force. I saw a show on the mollusk last night. Elaine, the mollusk travels from Alaska to Chile just for a shot at another mollusk. You think you're any better?"
S08E02,ELAINE,Yes! I think I am better than the mollusk!
S08E02,KEVIN,I couldn't help overhearing what you were saying.
S08E02,ELAINE,"Oh, I'm sorry."
S08E02,KEVIN,"No, no, I think I agree with you. I mean, all this talk about having babies."
S08E02,ELAINE,"Yeah, like you must procreate."
S08E02,KEVIN,"Besides, anyone can do it."
S08E02,ELAINE,"Oh, it's been done to death. (smiles)"
S08E02,GEORGE,"I, uh, should have a poem very soon now."
S08E02,WYCK,"Are you okay, George?"
S08E02,GEORGE,"No, no, not really. Ever since Susan passed on, I have good days and bad. (Turns the briefcase towards the woman on his left.) Some days, I'm haunted by one word - why. Why Susan? Why wasn't it me licking those invitations? Why am I still here? Well, I gotta run. (Gets up and leaves the meeting.)"
S08E02,WYCK,"...and the stock options for this year look quite, uh... (George returns and retrieves the briefcase.)"
S08E02,GEORGE (apologetic),Briefcase. (Shrugs and exits.)
S08E02,ELAINE,"So, Kevin. If I don't want children, does that make me a bad humanitarian?"
S08E02,KEVIN,Not at all.
S08E02,ELAINE,"'Cause, I mean, when you get to know me, you'll see that I'm a pretty good humanitarian. (Waitress comes to the table and pours more coffee.) You are doing a wonderful job, by the way. Thanks a lot. (To Kevin) Right? Am I right? (Kramer walks by.) Kramer. Kramer! Come here, look at my new friend Kevin. (Kramer and Kevin shake hands.) Oh, you got a little, uh..."
S08E02,KRAMER (wipes chocolate off his face),"Oh, I just had two double-fudge sundaes."
S08E02,ELAINE,Oh. Are you alright?
S08E02,KRAMER,"Yeah, I'll be okay."
S08E02,ELAINE,"You know, Jerry has one of those every time he bombs on stage."
S08E02,KRAMER,"Well, I'm sure he'll be sharing his next one with Pam."
S08E02,ELAINE,"Oh, no...that won't last."
S08E02,KRAMER,What do you mean?
S08E02,ELAINE,He's not ga-ga.
S08E02,GEORGE,"Lemme tell you something, that Jerry Lewis? You wonder how some of these people get to the top? It's ideas like this! Brilliant! Hah-hah! (Notices that the briefcase is damaged.) Look at this - what the hell happened? The whole side is damaged here...and the lock is broken."
S08E02,JERRY,How long did you leave it up there?
S08E02,GEORGE,Five minutes. What the hell happened here?
S08E02,JERRY,"Play the tape, maybe we'll get a clue."
S08E02,GEORGE,"I have to rewind it first. (George presses the rewind button on the tape recorder. He and Jerry stand there, waiting impatiently as it rewinds.) Alright, alright."
S08E02,JERRY,Is that it?
S08E02,GEORGE,Stopped dead.
S08E02,JERRY,What do you make of it?
S08E02,GEORGE,I don't know. (George sits down at the table. Kramer enters.)
S08E02,KRAMER,"Jerry. Uh, can we talk?"
S08E02,GEORGE (to Kramer),Kinda busy here.
S08E02,KRAMER,I'd like to talk to Jerry in private.
S08E02,GEORGE,Why can't I stay?
S08E02,KRAMER,Because it doesn't concern you.
S08E02,GEORGE,"Well, if it doesn't concern me, then I can stay. (Kramer grabs the back of George's chair, drags him out into the hallway and closes the door.)"
S08E02,JERRY,"So, what's on your mind?"
S08E02,KRAMER,It's Pam.
S08E02,JERRY,Pam? What about Pam?
S08E02,KRAMER,"I love her, Jerry!"
S08E02,JERRY,You what?
S08E02,KRAMER,I love her!
S08E02,JERRY,Is that right?
S08E02,KRAMER,"Oh, she's uh...she's real. She can bring home the bacon and fry it in the pan."
S08E02,JERRY,What does that mean?
S08E02,KRAMER,"Oh, and that voice!"
S08E02,JERRY,What about her name?
S08E02,KRAMER,"Pam? Oh, it's a beautiful name. (Kramer sits on the couch.) Pam. Pam. Pam!"
S08E02,JERRY,She's got really nice hair.
S08E02,KRAMER,"Oh, it's incredible. Although, I might replace her tortoise clip with one of those velvet scrunchies. I love those."
S08E02,JERRY,You've got really specific tastes.
S08E02,KRAMER,"Oh, I know what I want, Jerry."
S08E02,JERRY,She's got nice calves.
S08E02,KRAMER,"Oh, she's a dreamboat. But, you don't like her, so..."
S08E02,JERRY,"Maybe I could, you're making some pretty good points."
S08E02,KRAMER,"No you can't, Jerry."
S08E02,JERRY,But I might.
S08E02,KRAMER,"Oh, no you don't."
S08E02,JERRY,Why not? The voice? The calves? The bacon?
S08E02,KRAMER,What...?
S08E02,JERRY,I think I can! I even like the name! Pam!
S08E02,KRAMER (frantic),Huh?
S08E02,JERRY,Pam!
S08E02,KRAMER,Huh?
S08E02,JERRY,Pam!
S08E02,KRAMER,"Huh-yah! (Kramer loses it and runs out past George, who is still sitting in the hallway on a chair.)"
S08E02,KRAMER,So now he wants her more than ever!
S08E02,NEWMAN,Blast!
S08E02,KRAMER,"What am I gonna do, huh?"
S08E02,NEWMAN,"Don't despair, my friend. (Newman walks in front of Kramer and trips over his feet. Again.) I won't allow your love to go unrequited. Not like mine."
S08E02,KRAMER,"What, again with you?"
S08E02,NEWMAN,Sorry. But love is spice with many tastes. A dizzying array of textures...and moments.
S08E02,KRAMER,If only I could say things like that around her.
S08E02,NEWMAN (getting an idea),Yes...
S08E02,ELAINE,"Well, I hear three distinct sounds. A low rumple...followed by a metallic 'squink'..."
S08E02,GEORGE,"Yes! Yes, I heard the 'squink'!"
S08E02,ELAINE,...followed by a mysterious...'glonk.'
S08E02,GEORGE,"It's baffling, isn't it?"
S08E02,ELAINE,"Well, one question does come to mind. Have you considered just...asking them what happened to the briefcase?"
S08E02,GEORGE,"They would never tell me, Elaine. First of all, they probably think that I killed Susan. Besides, I don't even think they like me. (Jerry comes over to the table.)"
S08E02,JERRY,That Pam! I am ga-ga over her!
S08E02,ELAINE,Ga-ga? When did that happen?
S08E02,JERRY,Yesterday. Six-ish.
S08E02,ELAINE,"Well, maybe we should double. I'm pretty ga-ga myself."
S08E02,JERRY,You just met the guy yesterday.
S08E02,ELAINE,"Yeah, but we have a common goal."
S08E02,JERRY,"A barren, sterile existence that ends when you die?"
S08E02,ELAINE (happily),Yeah.
S08E02,GEORGE,And you really believe this guy doesn't want to have kids.
S08E02,ELAINE,"Yeah, of course."
S08E02,JERRY,"Elaine, a guy'll say anything to get a woman."
S08E02,ELAINE,"Oh, please. He wouldn't say that."
S08E02,GEORGE,"Elaine, I once told a woman that I coined the phrase, ""Pardon my French."""
S08E02,JERRY,I once told a woman that I don't eat cake 'cause it goes right to my thighs.
S08E02,GEORGE,I once told a woman that I really enjoy spending time with my family.
S08E02,NEWMAN,"With your looks and my words, we'll have built the perfect beast. (Kramer claps him on the shoulder, then goes to the other side of the aisle to talk to Pam.)"
S08E02,PAM,"Oh, hi! Kramer."
S08E02,NEWMAN (whispers through the bookcase),Hi. How are you?
S08E02,KRAMER,Hi. How are you?
S08E02,PAM,I'm great.
S08E02,NEWMAN,I too am well.
S08E02,KRAMER,I too am well.
S08E02,NEWMAN,Do I smell Pantene?
S08E02,KRAMER,Do I smell?
S08E02,NEWMAN,Pantene!
S08E02,KRAMER,"Uh, Pantene."
S08E02,PAM,"Oh, my shampoo. Yeah, it is Pantene, I got a free sample in with my junk mail."
S08E02,KRAMER (talks rapidly in an attempt to keep up with Newman),"Well, there really is no junk-mail...well, everybody wants to get a check or a birthday card, but..."
S08E02,NEWMAN (frantic),...it takes just as much man-power to deliver it as their precious little greeting cards...
S08E02,KRAMER,Newman! (Elbows him through the books. Newman falls over.)
S08E02,PAM,What?
S08E02,KRAMER,"Uh, human. It's...human to be moved by a fragrance."
S08E02,PAM,That's so true.
S08E02,KRAMER,Her bouquet cleaved his hardened...
S08E02,NEWMAN,Shell.
S08E02,KRAMER,...shell. And fondled his muscled heart. He embibed her glistening spell...just before the other shoe...fell.
S08E02,PAM,"Kramer, that is so lovely."
S08E02,KRAMER,It's by an unknown 20th-century poet.
S08E02,PAM,"Oh, what's his name?"
S08E02,KRAMER,"Newman. (On the other side of the bookcase, Newman preens proudly.)"
S08E02,KEVIN,"Elaine, you've changed my life."
S08E02,ELAINE,"Oh, Kevin...you can go on and on about how you don't want kids...and it sounds, it sounds really nice, but...the truth is, I don't know if you mean it or not."
S08E02,KEVIN,I got a vasectomy this morning.
S08E02,ELAINE,"Although, I have a hunch you mean it."
S08E02,JERRY,"I just came by to tell you - I'm really, really happy about this relationship. Really happy."
S08E02,PAM,"Oh. Well, that's um...(clears her throat)...nice. (Jerry looks suspicious. Pam turns around and Jerry notices her tortoise clip has been replaced with a velvet scrunchie.)"
S08E02,JERRY's brain,A velvet scrunchie!
S08E02,JERRY,Kramer!
S08E02,JERRY,"Hello, Newman."
S08E02,NEWMAN,"Hello, Jerry. How's Pam?"
S08E02,JERRY,Pam? What do you care? (Newman shrugs. Jerry notices he's carrying a Brentano's bookstore bag.)
S08E02,NEWMAN,"Well, ta-ta! (Scampers away.)"
S08E02,JERRY,"Wait a minute! (A manic chase scene ensues, with Jerry chasing Newman from one end of the building to the other. Jerry finally catches up with him in the hallway on another floor.)"
S08E02,JERRY,"Alright, Newman! This is it! (Shoves him against the wall.)"
S08E02,NEWMAN (sweating),"Easy, Jerry. Steady. You wouldn't want to lose your cool at a time like this."
S08E02,JERRY,Why not?
S08E02,NEWMAN,"Because right now, I'm the only chance you've got. (Newman giggles nervously. Jerry makes Newman flinch, and his giggling is choked off.)"
S08E02,JERRY (rolls his eyes),C'mon. (They exit.)
S08E02,JERRY,I can't believe I'm losing Pam!
S08E02,NEWMAN,"I know how you feel. For I, too, have a woman for whom I pine."
S08E02,JERRY,I thought we were talking about me.
S08E02,NEWMAN,Right.
S08E02,JERRY,"Anyway, I don't need your help. (Turns to leave.)"
S08E02,NEWMAN,"Oh, don't you? Joke boy? You really think you can manipulate that beautiful young woman like the half-soused nightclub rabble that lap up your inane ""observations""?"
S08E02,JERRY,"Alright, Newman. What do I have to do to get you to stop pulling the strings for Kramer?"
S08E02,NEWMAN,"Well, there is a little something you can do for me..."
S08E02,JERRY,"C'mon, out with it."
S08E02,NEWMAN,It's about...Elaine.
S08E02,JERRY,Elaine? What does she have to - (notices Newman looking up at him longlingly.) Oh no...
S08E02,NEWMAN,You dated her. Give me some inside information. Anything I can use!
S08E02,JERRY (shrugs),"Well, I know she doesn't want to have kids. (Newman considers the implications of this.)"
S08E02,KEVIN,I thought you'd be a little more enthusiastic about it.
S08E02,ELAINE,"I know, I don't want...(clears her throat)...kids."
S08E02,KEVIN,What was that?
S08E02,ELAINE,"Well, Kevin, maybe I have a little doubt. I mean, nothing is a hundred percent."
S08E02,KEVIN,"This is! Oh boy, I always do this."
S08E02,ELAINE,What?
S08E02,KEVIN,"Oh, I get all jazzed up about something and I go way to far with it."
S08E02,ELAINE,Really?
S08E02,KEVIN,"Oh, yeah. Like last summer. I'm watchin' TV and I saw one of those jet-skis. $4000 later and it's sitting in my garage."
S08E02,ELAINE,"You know, that's weird, actually, 'cause I'm sort of the same way. I mean once for like, no reason, I flattened my hair and I had all these strands hanging in my face all the time..."
S08E02,KEVIN,Sometimes I think I do want kids. Maybe a lot of kids!
S08E02,ELAINE,Sometimes I think about wearing my hair real short.
S08E02,KEVIN,Yeah! I think I like short hair. Really short.
S08E02,ELAINE,Yeah!
S08E02,KEVIN,Yeah!
S08E02,GEORGE,This is a crude mock-up of the conference room. 1/14th scale.
S08E02,JERRY,When did you build this thing?
S08E02,GEORGE,"Yesterday, took the day off. (Picks up a red Power Ranger action figure from the model and pretends it's him.) Now, from the time I left the room..."
S08E02,JERRY (points at the Power Ranger),"Wait, that's you?"
S08E02,GEORGE,Yeah.
S08E02,JERRY (picks up a yellow M&M toy from the model),I really think the M&M should be you.
S08E02,GEORGE (grabs the M&M away from Jerry),"Alright, whatever! Now. Whatever caused the damage...(drops a tiny briefcase onto the table in the model)...was jarring enough to completely stop the tape."
S08E02,JERRY,And?
S08E02,GEORGE,Okay. That's what we know.
S08E02,JERRY,But we already knew that.
S08E02,GEORGE,"Well, yeah."
S08E02,JERRY,Just give me some idea of what you think it could be.
S08E02,GEORGE,I don't know if you're ready for it.
S08E02,JERRY,Please.
S08E02,GEORGE,"I believe that I am about to become the target of a systematic process of intimidation and manipulation, the likes of which you have never -"
S08E02,JERRY,"Hold it, hold it! You're right, I'm not ready for this. (The door buzzer sounds, Jerry answers it.) Yeah?"
S08E02,VOICE ON SPEAKER,It's Pam.
S08E02,JERRY,"C'mon up. (To George) Alright, it's Pam, you gotta get goin.'"
S08E02,GEORGE,"I'm not through here, Jerry. (Picks up the model of the conference room.) I'm gonna keep on investigating. This thing is like an onion. The more layers you peel, the more it stinks. (Pam enters, George leaves.)"
S08E02,PAM,What was that?
S08E02,JERRY,We were just playin.'
S08E02,PAM,"Listen, I had a long talk with Kramer today..."
S08E02,JERRY,Uh huh...
S08E02,PAM,"Well, the thing is, I uh...I think I have a little crush on him. (Kramer slides in the door on his knees.)"
S08E02,KRAMER,I'm so happy! My world suddenly has meaning!
S08E02,JERRY (to Pam),This is the man you have a crush on?
S08E02,PAM,"Well, I have feelings for both of you."
S08E02,KRAMER,How can you have feelings for him? We're soul mates.
S08E02,JERRY,Why can't I be a soul mate?
S08E02,KRAMER,"Jerry, you really think that Pam would want you to be the father of her children?"
S08E02,PAM,Children? Who said anything about children? I don't want to have children.
S08E02,GEORGE,"There are some people in this room who would have been very happy to never see this briefcase again. There are people in this room who think they can destroy other people's property and get away with it. Well, let me tell you something about those people. They weren't counting on this brain! And this tape recorder."
S08E02,WYCK,George...
S08E02,GEORGE,"You'll have your turn! The truth must be heard. (Plays back the tape.) That's all there was. And yet, it speaks volumes. A low rumple. A metallic 'squink.' A 'glonk.' Someone crying out...""Dear God!"" Let's start with, uh...with you, Wyck."
S08E02,WYCK,"George, Quinn here was moving a chair...he lost his balance and dropped it...it must have fallen on your briefcase, which, for some reason, contained a running tape recorder?"
S08E02,GEORGE,"Alright, then. We've gotten to the bottom of that."
S08E02,ELAINE,What are you guys doing here?
S08E02,JERRY,We're getting vasectomies.
S08E02,ELAINE,Why?
S08E02,NEWMAN (to Elaine),I'm doing it for you.
S08E02,ELAINE,What?
S08E02,JERRY (to Elaine),What'd you do to your hair?
S08E02,ELAINE,I cut it.
S08E02,JERRY,It's a little short.
S08E02,KEVIN,Y'think?
S08E02,JERRY (to Kevin),What are you doing here?
S08E02,ELAINE,Kevin's having his vasectomy reversed.
S08E02,JERRY and NEWMAN,"Reversed?! (Kramer comes hobbling out of the doctors office in pain, after having a vasectomy of his own, and exits. Jerry and Newman look at each other, and bolt for the door themselves.)"
S08E02,GEORGE,...he embibed her glistening spell...just before the other shoe...fell.
S08E02,WYCK,Is that a Keats poem?
S08E02,GEORGE,"No, it's a Newman. Well, I gotta run. (Smiles, pats his briefcase and exits.)"
S08E02,WYCK,Does anyone think George might have murdered Susan?
S08E02,MR. CROSS,"Oh, yeah. I just assumed he murdered her."
S08E02,MS. BAINES,Of course he killed her.
S08E02,WYCK,"So it's not just me, then. Alright! Back to business."
S08E03,JERRY,All right. How 'bout this one let's say you're abducted by aliens.
S08E03,GEORGE,Fine.
S08E03,JERRY,"They haul you aboard the mother ship, take you back to their planet as a curiosity. Now would you rather be in their zoo, or their circus?"
S08E03,GEORGE,I gotta go zoo. I feel like I could set more of my own schedule.
S08E03,JERRY,"But in the circus you get to ride around in the train, see the whole planet!"
S08E03,GEORGE,"I'm wearin' a little hat, I'm jumpin' through fire.. They're puttin' their little alien heads in my mouth.."
S08E03,JERRY,(resigned) At least it's show business..
S08E03,GEORGE,"But in the zoo, you know, they might, put a woman in there with me to uh.. you know, get me to mate."
S08E03,JERRY,What if she's got no interest in you?
S08E03,GEORGE,W--then I'm pretty much where I am now. At least I got to take a ride on a spaceship.
S08E03,[Exterior long shot,"looking up at an office building; Interior of office reception area of ""Brand/Leland"" as GEORGE, JERRY, and KRAMER come in. They calmly keep it quiet.]"
S08E03,KRAMER,"George, why couldn't I use the bathroom in that store?"
S08E03,GEORGE,"Kramer, trust me, this is the best bathroom in midtown!"
S08E03,KRAMER,(frustrated) Wha??
S08E03,JERRY,(dry) He knows.
S08E03,GEORGE,"(Anyway,) on the left--exquisite marble! High ceilings. An' a flush, like a jet engine! (imitates sound) Ha ha!"
S08E03,KRAMER,"(impressed) Now, listen, uh. You better not wait. I'll catch you later."
S08E03,GEORGE,You sure?
S08E03,JERRY,(dry) He knows.
S08E03,GEORGE,Wow. Nice.
S08E03,JERRY,Why don't you try your engagement story?
S08E03,GEORGE,"(considers, but got into elevator) Won't work."
S08E03,JERRY,Are you sure?
S08E03,GEORGE,(wry) He knows.
S08E03,ELAINE,"Look. Kevin. I really like you, heh, heh, uh. But, um, maybe we'd be, better off just being.. friends. (takes a bite of her sandwich)"
S08E03,KEVIN,Friends?
S08E03,ELAINE,"Well. I mean. (distracted by the food) Oh, god. This tuna tastes like an old sponge."
S08E03,KEVIN,Friends. Yeah! Why not friends? I might like to try that! Like you an' Jerry!
S08E03,MAN,(frustrated) Damn thing is jammed again..
S08E03,KRAMER,"You know what happens with these? The rollers, they get flat spots on 'em. (hits button several times and whacks it)"
S08E03,MAN,"Come on, let's go."
S08E03,KRAMER,"(absently wants to be part of it) Oh, yeah--yeah.. (follows them)"
S08E03,ELAINE,"(to JERRY) Remember I was telling you about Gillian, my friend who writes for the L.L. Bean catalogue? I really think you should give her a call."
S08E03,JERRY,"(doubtful) I don't know, do you have a--"
S08E03,JERRY,Not bad. Wuh--what does she--
S08E03,ELAINE,(dry) I put her stats on the back.
S08E03,JERRY,"Pretty impressive--""Serious boyfriend '92 to '95."" Owns her own car.. ""Favorite president James Polk!"" (ELAINE had echoed ""Uh-huh. Yup."" during it)"
S08E03,GEORGE,Hnn! Let me see that.
S08E03,JERRY,"(hands it to him as he asks ELAINE) So how'd it go with Kevin? Did you, steel-toe his ass back to Kentucky?"
S08E03,ELAINE,(laughs in appreciation) You are not gonna believe this! I told him that I just wanted to be friends. He's fine with it. He really wants to be friends.
S08E03,JERRY,Why would anybody want a friend.
S08E03,ELAINE,"(dread) Uh. It's really not that bad, actually. He said he'd even go with me to the Museum of Miniatures. This is something you would never ever do."
S08E03,JERRY,I mean all that stuff is so small.. ((ELAINE is wryly assessing him)) stupid..
S08E03,GEORGE,"(still looking at that picture) You know if I told my engagement story to that receptionist, but told her this, was my fiance.."
S08E03,JERRY,What?
S08E03,GEORGE,"Don't you see. Women like that are like, members of a secret tribe living in a forbidden city. People like me have not been inside in thousands of years.. But with this, it's like I've already been with one of her own! My hands been stamped! I come and go as I please!"
S08E03,ELAINE,"(wry, not impressed) Well you cracked it! I warned the Queen you were gettin' close an', now it looks like we're gonna have to move the whole damn forbidden city. (chuckles with JERRY)"
S08E03,GEORGE,(getting up) Can I keep this?
S08E03,ELAINE,"No, I need it."
S08E03,GEORGE,(absently leaving with it) Thanks.
S08E03,GEORGE,"Hi. I'm ah, I'm here to see a Mr. Art Vandelay.."
S08E03,AMANDA,"I'm sorry sir, there is no Mr. Vandelay here.."
S08E03,GEORGE,"(taking out wallet) Well, let me. Heh. Let me just eh.. check an', make sure I have the right man--ha! Heh, heh, heh! Seems--oh! I, oh! (has conveniently dropped the photo into her view)"
S08E03,AMANDA,Oh! She's beautiful! Who is she?
S08E03,GEORGE,"(humble) Well, if you must know, shhhe, was my fiance, Susan. May she rest in peace."
S08E03,AMANDA,"Oh, sorry.. She was lovely. I'm Amanda."
S08E03,GEORGE,(shaking hands) I'm George.
S08E03,MAN #3,"Good work today, K-man!"
S08E03,MAN #3,"Heh, heh!"
S08E03,KRAMER,You want a drink? I'm buyin'.
S08E03,MAN #3,"In that case, make mine a double!"
S08E03,GILLIAN,Jerry?
S08E03,JERRY,Gillian. Hiii..
S08E03,GILLIAN,Very nice to meet you.
S08E03,JERRY,It's nice to meet you!
S08E03,JERRY,She had man-hands.
S08E03,ELAINE,"(pause) Man, Hands?"
S08E03,JERRY,"The hands of a man. It's like a creature out of Greek Mythology, I mean, she was like part woman, part horrible beast."
S08E03,ELAINE,"(weary) (Look,) would you, prefer it, if she had, no hands at all?"
S08E03,JERRY,Would she have hooks?
S08E03,ELAINE,"Do uh, do hooks make it more attractive, Jerry?"
S08E03,JERRY,Kinda cool lookin'..
S08E03,ELAINE,"(getting up to go) Uh.. Listen, you're picking me up from my (place tomorrow)--"
S08E03,JERRY,(leaving too) Yeah. Yeah.
S08E03,ELAINE,"Okay, I've got five, huge boxes of (buttons)."
S08E03,JERRY,"Right. Well if you need an extra set of hands, I know who you can call--"
S08E03,ELAINE,(weary) Jerry!
S08E03,JERRY,Kramer?!
S08E03,KRAMER,Hey buddy! Hey!
S08E03,JERRY,It--eight o'clock in the morning! What the hell is goin' on?!
S08E03,KRAMER,Breakfast. I gotta be in at Brand/Leland by nine.
S08E03,JERRY,Why??
S08E03,KRAMER,"Because I'm workin' there, that's why."
S08E03,JERRY,(disoriented) How long have I been asleep? What--what year is this?
S08E03,KRAMER,"Jerry. I don't know if you've noticed, but lately, I've been drifting, aimlessly?"
S08E03,JERRY,(snaps fingers) Now that you mention it.
S08E03,KRAMER,"But I finally realized what's missing, in my life. Structure. An' at Brand/Leland, I'm gettin' things done. An' I love the people I'm workin' with."
S08E03,JERRY,How much are they payin' you?
S08E03,KRAMER,"Oh, no, no, no-no--I don't want any pay. I'm doin' this just for me."
S08E03,JERRY,"Really. So uh, what do you do down there all day?"
S08E03,KRAMER,"T.C.B. You know, takin' care o' business. Aa--I gotta go."
S08E03,JERRY,All right.
S08E03,KRAMER,"(leaving) I'll see you tonight, huh? (turning back, grabs his briefcase) Forget my briefcase."
S08E03,JERRY,W-w-wha' you got in there?
S08E03,KRAMER,(as he leaves with it) Crackers.
S08E03,"(MUSIC (Sheena Easton's ""Morning Train (Nine to Five)"") accompanies assorted shots of working-man Kramer",Getting on the subway (everyone else is going the opposite direction). Washing his shoes at the water cooler. Eating rolls of crackers out of his briefcase. Laughing it up after hours with co-workers at a TGIF-type restaurant.)
S08E03,JERRY,So the picture worked. Amazing!
S08E03,GEORGE,"Hey, she wants me to dress uh ""smart casual."" What uh, what is that?"
S08E03,JERRY,"I don't know, but you don't have it."
S08E03,GEORGE,Right. Bye.
S08E03,ELAINE,Where were you today?
S08E03,JERRY,What?
S08E03,ELAINE,Pick. Up.
S08E03,JERRY,(whispers) Damn.
S08E03,ELAINE,So? Where were you?!
S08E03,JERRY,"Uh, here I guess, an' uh, uh I went out and picked up a paper."
S08E03,ELAINE,"(irritated, throwing down her bag) I had to ask Kevin, to leave his office an' come an' pick me up!"
S08E03,JERRY,So? What are friends for?
S08E03,ELAINE,"Yeah! An' he is a friend, Jerry. He is reliable. He is considerate. He's like your, exact opposite."
S08E03,JERRY,So he's Bizarro Jerry!
S08E03,ELAINE,(pause) Bizarro Jerry?
S08E03,JERRY,"Yeah. Like Bizarro Superman. Superman's exact opposite, who lives in the backwards bizarro world. Up is Down. Down is Up. He says ""Hello"" when he leaves, ""Good bye"" when he arrives."
S08E03,ELAINE,"(pause) Shouldn't he say ""Bad bye""? Isn't that the, opposite of ""Good bye""?"
S08E03,JERRY,No. It's still a goodbye.
S08E03,ELAINE,Uh. Does he live underwater?
S08E03,JERRY,No.
S08E03,ELAINE,Is he black..
S08E03,JERRY,"Look. Just, forget it, (already). All right?"
S08E03,KRAMER,Wow. Man. What a day. Could I use a drink. (starts getting a drink and ice)
S08E03,JERRY,Tough day at the office?
S08E03,KRAMER,"Just comin' in, an' that phone just wouldn't stop."
S08E03,JERRY,"Well, we better get goin' if we're gonna go to that uh, seven o'clock cold fusion."
S08E03,KRAMER,"Yeah. Well, count me out. I'm swimmin'. Old man Leland is bustin' my hump over these reports. If I don't get 'em done by nine, I'm toast.. ((takes a swig and reacts))"
S08E03,GEORGE,This is a fantastic place! I always thought it was a meat packing plant!
S08E03,MODEL #1,Hey! Amanda!
S08E03,AMANDA,"These are my friends. Anabelle, Justina, and Nikki. We used to model together."
S08E03,GEORGE,Oh! Modelling! What's that like? Fun? Ha ha. (to self in head) Stupid! Stupid! Stupid!
S08E03,AMANDA,"So Nikki, uh, how was Paris this time?"
S08E03,MODEL #2,(petulant) A bore.
S08E03,GEORGE,"You know, I used to love Paris. My uh, dead Fiance, Susan.. (opening wallet) In fact I. think I, I may have a picture of her.."
S08E03,MODEL #3,(awed) Wow.. She was beautiful.. Do you wanna dance?
S08E03,GILLIAN,"Would you like some bread, Jerry?"
S08E03,JERRY,"No.. No thanks, I'm, just not hungry."
S08E03,GILLIAN,"Well, then at least drink your beer.. (she's opening the bottle--brief closeup on hands)"
S08E03,JERRY,(to self) Oh. Twist off..
S08E03,GILLIAN,You have a little something on your face.
S08E03,JERRY,I can get it. (feeling his face)
S08E03,GILLIAN,"Eh, no-no, No-no.. You're missing it, it's higher. (reaches over)"
S08E03,GILLIAN,(friendly) It's an eyelash. Make a wish.
S08E03,JERRY,I don't want to.
S08E03,GILLIAN,Make a wish.
S08E03,JERRY,"Okay. (closes eyes, blows on her finger, opens eyes, says to self) Didn't come true."
S08E03,GILLIAN,(smiles at him) Don't you just love lobster?
S08E03,KEVIN,That Museum of Miniatures was amazing.
S08E03,ELAINE,"I know, he's so tiny!"
S08E03,KEVIN,"Yeah! Hey--hey guys! Elaine, sit down. These are a couple o' my friends. Uh, this is Gene. And this guy, we.. just call ""Feldman!"""
S08E03,ELAINE,(to self in head) Bizarro world..
S08E03,GEORGE,(delighted) Jerry? It was incredible! Models! As far as the eye could see!
S08E03,JERRY,Then it does exist.
S08E03,GEORGE,Yes. The legends are true.
S08E03,JERRY,So when are you goin' out with this girl again?
S08E03,GEORGE,I'm not! I'm inside the walls!
S08E03,JERRY,So you're gonna burn that bridge.
S08E03,GEORGE,Flame on!
S08E03,GENE,(about the check) I got it.
S08E03,KEVIN,(grabs it) No. You got it last time.
S08E03,GENE,(calmly takes it) Don't worry about it.
S08E03,ELAINE,(to self in head) This is unbelievable..
S08E03,FELDMAN,"Hey Elaine, what do you think of an alarm clock, that automatically tells you the weather when you wake up?"
S08E03,ELAINE,"Well, I gotta say that I think that that is a fantastic idea, Feldman!"
S08E03,FELDMAN,"Nah, it's not--it's just not practical."
S08E03,KEVIN,"(getting up) Well. See ya later, Elaine. Feldman an' I 'a' gotta get down 'o the library. (the three guys are leaving)"
S08E03,ELAINE,What are you gonna do down there?
S08E03,KEVIN,Read!
S08E03,ELAINE,"(pause, then vaguely waves while watching them leave) Hello?"
S08E03,JERRY,"So, uh. Gillian's comin' over later. I think I'm gonna end it."
S08E03,KRAMER,Uh-huh.
S08E03,JERRY,"Those meaty paws, I feel like I'm dating George the Animal, (steer)."
S08E03,KRAMER,Yeah..
S08E03,JERRY,Maybe I'll chain her to the refrigerator an' sell tickets.
S08E03,KRAMER,That's nice..
S08E03,JERRY,"Kramer, put the paper down! You never listen to me anymore! We hardly even talk!"
S08E03,KRAMER,"Well, we're, talkin' now, aren't we?--"
S08E03,JERRY,I sit here for twenty lousy minutes in the morning--
S08E03,KRAMER,Oh here we go--
S08E03,JERRY,"An' then when you come home at night, you're always exhausted--we never do anything anymore!"
S08E03,KRAMER,What are you starting with me for? You know this is my crazy time o' year?!
S08E03,JERRY,(pause) It's your third day..
S08E03,KRAMER,(grabs briefcase to leave) I gotta go to work. We'll talk about this later. (leaves)
S08E03,JERRY,Well. (calling down the hall) Call if you're gonna be late!
S08E03,ELAINE,What? What is goin' on with you two?
S08E03,JERRY,"Oh, I don't wanna talk about it.."
S08E03,ELAINE,"All right, listen. Have you seen my addre-- (sees address book on counter) --ah! There it is. Okay. I got it. I'll see you later. (leaving)"
S08E03,JERRY,Hey! Wait! Wait! Wait a second! Where you goin'? I-I hardly ever see you anymore.
S08E03,ELAINE,"(stops, pause) Well, I. (a little ashamed) I guess I been at Reggie's.."
S08E03,JERRY,The Bizarro coffeeshop?
S08E03,ELAINE,Kevin and his friends are nice people! They do good things. They read..
S08E03,JERRY,I read.
S08E03,ELAINE,"Books, Jerry."
S08E03,JERRY,(pause) Oh. Big deal..
S08E03,ELAINE,"Well! I can't spend the rest of my life coming into this stinking apartment every ten minutes to pore over the, excruciating minutia, of every, single, daily event.."
S08E03,JERRY,"(What's goin' on,) like yesterday, I go to the bank to make a deposit, an' the teller gives me this look, like--"
S08E03,ELAINE,I'll see you later man. I gotta go.
S08E03,JERRY,"(frustrated, to self) The whole system is breakin' down!"
S08E03,GEORGE,"Hello? Amanda. Hi, yes. Listen. You know, I'm thinkin', we might just be better of bein' friends. Yeah. Yeah, you know what, I can't even really talk about it right now. Bye-bye. (hangs up) (happy with himself, but then sees the burned up photo) No! No!"
S08E03,GILLIAN,Friends. Just friends.
S08E03,JERRY,Yeah.
S08E03,GILLIAN,"Yeah. All right. Well, do you still want to see a movie later?"
S08E03,JERRY,"I wish I could, but, we're friends.."
S08E03,GILLIAN,"I'm just gonna go, wash my hands."
S08E03,JERRY,"Good idea. (phone's ringing, goes to it) (muttering) There's a beach towel on the rack.. (to phone) Yeah."
S08E03,GEORGE,"(frantic) Jerry! Jerry, muh--muh--my hair-dryer ruined the picture! An' I need another one or I can't get back into the forbidden city!"
S08E03,JERRY,(to drive him crazy) Who is this..
S08E03,GEORGE,Jerry! I need you to get another picture of man-hands. I'm beggin' you!
S08E03,JERRY,"(pause) If I get it for you, will you take me to that club an' show me a good time?"
S08E03,GEORGE,"Yes! Yes, all right--anything!"
S08E03,JERRY,Got it. (but now a man-hand grabs his arm) Uh!
S08E03,KRAMER,Jerry. Hey Jerry?
S08E03,JERRY,I'm right here. (note he has an athletic bandage on his right hand) You're late.
S08E03,KRAMER,"Yeah, well, I got held up, you know. What happened to your hand?"
S08E03,JERRY,Like you care.
S08E03,KRAMER,"The work piled up, I lost track of time--"
S08E03,JERRY,"(calmly getting up with plate of chicken) Oh! Sure! Sure! You an' your work! Elaine's off in the Bizarro World, George only calls when he wants something, an' I'm left sitting here like this plate of cold chicken, which, by the way, (drops chicken into sink) was, for two."
S08E03,KRAMER,You cooked?
S08E03,JERRY,(calm) I ordered in. It's still effort.
S08E03,KRAMER,(in pain) Ow! Jeez!
S08E03,JERRY,What's wrong?
S08E03,KRAMER,(Ow!) It's my stomach.
S08E03,JERRY,You're probably gettin' an ulcer. This job is killing you! It's killing Us.
S08E03,KRAMER,"(putting briefcase down) You know what? You're right. These reports, they can wait a couple of hours. Whadda say we go out tonight? Any place you want."
S08E03,JERRY,The coffeeshop?
S08E03,KRAMER,"You got it, buddy."
S08E03,JERRY,(pleased) I'll call George!
S08E03,JERRY,Hey. Isn't that Elaine?
S08E03,GEORGE,"(quiet, desperate) Maybe she can get me another picture of man-hands. (calling) Elaine!"
S08E03,JERRY,Elaine!
S08E03,KRAMER,Elaine!
S08E03,ALL THREE,Elaine! Elaine!
S08E03,"(ELAINE finally notices them, but suddenly from the other direction, three other guys are coming","GENE, KEVIN, and FELDMAN.)"
S08E03,KEVIN,Hey! Elaine! Hi-i! Over here!
S08E03,ELAINE,"Jerry.. George, Kramer.. This is Kevin, Gene.. and Feldman."
S08E03,JERRY,(quietly crept out) This is really weird..
S08E03,ELAINE,"(diplomatically to KEVIN, GENE, and FELDMAN) Could you guys excuse us, just for a moment."
S08E03,KEVIN,Sure. (strolls away with his friends)
S08E03,ELAINE,"(pause) Thanks. (to JERRY, GEORGE, and KRAMER) What.. what do you guys want.."
S08E03,GEORGE,"Elaine, I got to have another picture of Gillian."
S08E03,JERRY,I tried to get him one but Man-Hands almost ripped my arm out of the socket!
S08E03,KEVIN,(Here ya are.)
S08E03,ELAINE,"(pause, turns back to JERRY et al.) Guys. I gotta go. Take it easy."
S08E03,GEORGE,"Elaine? (she turns, sighing) Can I come?"
S08E03,ELAINE,"I'm, I'm sorry.. We've already got a George.."
S08E03,KRAMER,"What did you want to see me about, Mr. Leland?"
S08E03,LELAND,"Kramer, I've.. been reviewing your work.. Quite frankly, it stinks."
S08E03,KRAMER,"Well, I ah.. been havin' trouble at home and uh.. I mean, ah, you know, I'll work harder, nights, weekends, whatever it takes.."
S08E03,LELAND,"No, no, I don't think that's going to, do it, uh. These reports you handed in. It's almost as if you have no business training at all.. I don't know what this is supposed to be!"
S08E03,KRAMER,"Well, I'm uh, just--tryin' to get ahead.."
S08E03,LELAND,"Well, I'm sorry. There's just no way that we could keep you on."
S08E03,KRAMER,I don't even really work here!
S08E03,LELAND,That's what makes this so difficult.
S08E03,GEORGE,Hi. George.
S08E03,MODEL #4,Are you sure you're supposed to be here?
S08E03,GEORGE,"Oh, yeah. Yeah. I used to come here all the time with my fiance, back when it was a meat-packing plant. Ha. Here's her picture. (hands her a magazine page)"
S08E03,MODEL #4,What'd you do? Cut this out of a magazine or something?
S08E03,GEORGE,Huh?
S08E03,MODEL #4,That's me? It's from a Clinique ad I did..
S08E03,GEORGE,Ha! Heh.
S08E03,BOUNCER,Let's go. Private party. (escorts him out)
S08E03,KEVIN,Who is it?
S08E03,ELAINE,(off-camera) It's Lainey!
S08E03,KEVIN,"(unlocks, opens door) Hi Elaine! (warmly hugs her)"
S08E03,ELAINE,Hi (?). Oh! Oh-oh-oh-oh!
S08E03,KEVIN,Come on in!
S08E03,ELAINE,"Okay. Hi Gene! (comfortably tosses her bag to the left, it falls on the floor) Uh-ha! (smiling, picks up her bag, puts it on a chair that's to the right)"
S08E03,ELAINE,What's up?
S08E03,KEVIN,(friendly) Just reading..
S08E03,"(ELAINE decides to make herself at home, opens the refrigerator and starts eating olives out of a jar, with her fingers. In the living room area, KEVIN is looking at her. Note",a statue of Bizarro Superman on a stereo speaker.)
S08E03,KEVIN,Hey.. What're you doing?
S08E03,ELAINE,Eatin' olives.
S08E03,KEVIN,Have you ever heard of asking? (door bell rings) Who is it?
S08E03,FELDMAN,(off-screen) Feldman.. From across the hall.
S08E03,KEVIN,"(drops his suspicion and smiles, goes to door) Hold on. (unlocks and opens door) Hey."
S08E03,FELDMAN,"He-ey, Kevin!"
S08E03,KEVIN,Hi.
S08E03,FELDMAN,Look who I ran into.
S08E03,VARGUS,"(testy) Hello, Kevin.."
S08E03,KEVIN,"(testy) Hello, Vargus.."
S08E03,KEVIN,Ya wanna catch a ballgame this weekend?
S08E03,VARGUS,Great! I'll see ya later! (leaves)
S08E03,KEVIN,"Okay. (to self, smiling) Vargus.. (to FELDMAN) So?"
S08E03,FELDMAN,I got 'em..
S08E03,KEVIN,"All right! Hey, Elaine, Feldman was able to get us all tickets to the Bolshoi!"
S08E03,ELAINE,Oh! (comes to him)
S08E03,KEVIN,"(enthused) Fourth row, center."
S08E03,ELAINE,"Get out! (pushes him back, but he falls back on the floor!)"
S08E03,GENE,(to ELAINE) What is the matter with you?
S08E03,ELAINE,"Oh, Kevin! I'm so sorry. Is there anything I can do?"
S08E03,GENE,Haven't you done enough already?
S08E03,ELAINE,"(turning to them, awkward) It's locked.."
S08E03,JERRY,"So this is it, huh?"
S08E03,GEORGE,"But it--eh.. It was here, I'm tellin' you, an' w--w--it was really here! The, there was, a, bar, and a, an' a dance floor.."
S08E03,JERRY,(dry) I guess the DJ booth was over there behind the bone saw? (really disappointed) Let's get out of here George.
S08E03,GENE,"At work today, I discovered there's a payphone in the lobby that has free long distance."
S08E03,KEVIN,"Oh, so what did you do?"
S08E03,GENE,I called the phone company an' immediately reported the error.
S08E03,KEVIN,Nice. (doorbell rings) Who is it?
S08E03,FELDMAN,(off-screen) Feldman.. From across the hall.
S08E03,KEVIN,"(smiles, relieved) Hold on."
S08E03,FELDMAN,Kevin! Brought some groceries.
S08E03,KEVIN,"Again?! Feldman, you didn't have to do that!"
S08E03,FELDMAN,"Hey, what are friends for?"
S08E03,KEVIN,"You know, I may not say this enough but you two are about the best friends a guy could have."
S08E03,KEVIN,(eyes closed in hug) Oh. Me so happy. Me want to cry.
S08E04,KRAMER,I wouldn't walk over there.
S08E04,JERRY,Why not?
S08E04,KRAMER,"It's the most dangerous part of the sidewalk. Cab hops a curb, wap! You've had your last egg sandwich."
S08E04,JERRY,What about over there? You know air conditioners fall out all the time.
S08E04,KRAMER,I'd much rather get hit by an 80 pound air conditioner than a two ton cab.
S08E04,JERRY,"No, cab's comin' in right here (Hand at waist) Set of plastic hips, prosthetic legs, and a monkey to answer the door, I'm back in business."
S08E04,KRAMER,"Much rather take it to the head, Like I did in '79."
S08E04,JERRY,"You were livin' in the village then, right?"
S08E04,KRAMER,Don't really remember.
S08E04,ELAINE,(Showing fingernails) Toxic waste green.
S08E04,JERRY,That is disgusting.
S08E04,ELAINE,"You know, revulsion has now become a valid form of attraction."
S08E04,JERRY,"Well, then you're drivin' me wild."
S08E04,ELAINE,I had 'em done for the big Peterman bash I'm throwin'.
S08E04,JERRY,"(George enters) Oh, why you havin' a party?"
S08E04,ELAINE,"I drive my people hard, and then I reward them."
S08E04,JERRY,Like with dogs.
S08E04,ELAINE,Exactly.
S08E04,GEORGE,Party?
S08E04,ELAINE,Yeah.
S08E04,GEORGE,Food?
S08E04,ELAINE,Uh huh.
S08E04,GEORGE,Bar?
S08E04,ELAINE,Yeah.
S08E04,GEORGE,George?
S08E04,JERRY,He's gonna show up anyway.
S08E04,ELAINE,"George, I just don't want you interfering."
S08E04,GEORGE,How could I possibly interfere?
S08E04,JERRY,Isn't that what Jack Ruby said?
S08E04,GEORGE,"(Eating) Oh yeah. These are fantastic, fantastic. (To server) You know, I'd love to get a jump on the next batch, where do you come out? (Server leaves) (To Anna) She's been ignoring this section all night. Quesadilla?"
S08E04,ANNA,No thanks.
S08E04,GEORGE,"Hi ah, My name is George."
S08E04,ANNA,Anna. I don't recall seeing you around the office. Do you work in the mail room?
S08E04,GEORGE,"No, I'm a friend of Elaine Benes."
S08E04,ANNA,Oh. Excuse me. (She leaves)
S08E04,GEORGE,So...
S08E04,MAN,How 'bout leading us in a toast?
S08E04,ELAINE,"Oh sure. Hey guys, I wanna make a toast. Um... Here's to us who wish us well, and those who don't can go to hell... All right, who's dancin'? C'mon, who's dancin'? You want me, You want me to get it started? I'll get it started. Whew! (She dances)"
S08E04,GEORGE,Sweet Fancy Moses!
S08E04,KRAMER,You get the tickets?
S08E04,JERRY,Who wants two? Special sneak preview of Death Blow.
S08E04,KRAMER,"Death Blow When someone tries to blow you up, not because of who you are, but for different reasons altogether. (Jerry buzzes up George) Jerry, do you think you can get an extra ticket for my friend Brody?"
S08E04,JERRY,"Kramer, do you know what I had to go through to get these?"
S08E04,KRAMER,"Yeah, I know, but he's a big fan of the genre. You know I'd consider it a personal favor to me."
S08E04,JERRY,Yeah I guess I do owe you.
S08E04,KRAMER,"Uh, listen, do you want me to stay here until George gets up?"
S08E04,JERRY,"No, I'm okay."
S08E04,KRAMER,"There's no problem, really."
S08E04,JERRY,"I'm fine. (George enters, Kramer exits) How was the party?"
S08E04,GEORGE,Food was good.
S08E04,JERRY,"Yeah, so I didn't miss anything?"
S08E04,GEORGE,"Well, actually you did miss one nugget of entertainment. (Pause) Have you ever seen Elaine dance?"
S08E04,JERRY,Elaine danced?
S08E04,GEORGE,It was more like a full bodied dry heave set to music.
S08E04,JERRY,Did she do the little kicks and the thumbs?
S08E04,GEORGE,"What, you mean you know about this?"
S08E04,JERRY,For some time... (video of Elaine dancing on the street with Jerry and the street musicians watching her awful dance) It was about five years ago. I never knew what to say to her about it. It was one of those problems I hoped would just go away.
S08E04,GEORGE,"Well, sometimes you can't help these people 'til they hit rock bottom."
S08E04,JERRY,And by then you've lost interest.
S08E04,GEORGE,"Hey, you gotta take a ride with me later. I borrowed my father's car. '68 GTO."
S08E04,JERRY,What made him get that thing?
S08E04,GEORGE,During that period when my folks were separated he went a little crazy.
S08E04,JERRY,Not a very long trip. (Enter Kramer)
S08E04,KRAMER,Brody's in.
S08E04,JERRY,I don't even have the extra ticket yet.
S08E04,KRAMER,"Well, you better get on the horn."
S08E04,ELAINE,"I'm tellin' you Jerry I'm gettin' a vibe. If I didn't know better, I'd say the staff completely lost respect for me. (Staff mocks her dancing in the background)"
S08E04,JERRY,How could that be?
S08E04,ELAINE,"Jerry, it's like the feeling is palpable. You think it could have something to do with the party?"
S08E04,JERRY,"No, George was there, he said he had a great time."
S08E04,ELAINE,"Ah, it's George. I bet you this is somehow George related."
S08E04,JERRY,"Oh, what are you talkin' about?"
S08E04,ELAINE,"He's like a virus. He attaches himself to a healthy host company, and the next thing you know, the entire staff's infected."
S08E04,JERRY,Now you're talkin' crazy!
S08E04,ELAINE,"All right, Jerry, if that's not what it is, you tell me. What is it?"
S08E04,JERRY,"(Makes sound) Oh there's my call waiting, I gotta get goin'."
S08E04,ANNA,You have a minute to approve some copy?
S08E04,ELAINE,"Oh yeah, sure, sure. So ah, did ya have a good time at the party last night?"
S08E04,ANNA,It was a real... kick.
S08E04,ELAINE,"Hey, did you happen to speak to my friend George?"
S08E04,ANNA,As a matter of fact I did.
S08E04,ELAINE,"Ah hah. Well, listen. You would be wise to keep your distance from him."
S08E04,ANNA,Why? He seems harmless.
S08E04,ELAINE,Oh he's not. He's very harmful.
S08E04,ANNA,Really?
S08E04,ELAINE,Oh trust me. He's a bad seed. He's a horrible seed. He's one of the worst seeds I've ever seen.
S08E04,ANNA,And you two are friends?
S08E04,ELAINE,"Yeah, we're good friends."
S08E04,GEORGE,So this Anna called me from out of the blue.
S08E04,JERRY,Really? I thought you were rebuffed.
S08E04,GEORGE,With extreme prejudice.
S08E04,JERRY,Maybe Elaine put in a good word for you.
S08E04,GEORGE,"No, no. That's just the thing. Anna told me that Elaine said I was one of the worst seeds she'd ever seen."
S08E04,JERRY,"Interesting. She doesn't care for you, then a stern warning, suddenly a phone call. Seems Elaine's made you the bad boy. And Anna digs the bad boy."
S08E04,GEORGE,I'm the bad boy. I've never been the bad boy.
S08E04,JERRY,"You've been the bad employee, the bad son, the bad friend..."
S08E04,GEORGE,"Yes ... yes, yes"
S08E04,JERRY,"The bad fianc&Mac226;, the bad dinner guest, the bad credit risk..."
S08E04,GEORGE,"Okay, the point is made."
S08E04,JERRY,"The bad date, the bad sport, the bad citizen... (looks at table as George exits) The bad tipper!"
S08E04,JERRY,Half of show business is here.
S08E04,KRAMER,There's Brody. Brody! Over here.
S08E04,BRODY,Hey Kramer. And you must be Jerry. Thanks for the ticket.
S08E04,JERRY,That's quite a feed bag you're workin' on there.
S08E04,BRODY,It's for all of us. Is there a problem?
S08E04,KRAMER,"Brody, c'mon. He's just kidding. He's a joke maker. Tell him, Jerry."
S08E04,JERRY,I'm a joke maker.
S08E04,KRAMER,"All right, here we go, Death Blow. (Brody takes out video camera)"
S08E04,JERRY,"(To Kramer) Hey, hey, what the hell is he doing?"
S08E04,KRAMER,"Relax, he does that all the time."
S08E04,JERRY,Does what?
S08E04,KRAMER,"He's making a copy of the movie for sale on the street, hum?"
S08E04,JERRY,May I see you outside for a moment please?
S08E04,KRAMER,But I want to--
S08E04,JERRY,Outside!
S08E04,ELAINE,"Hey, have you seen Anna?"
S08E04,WORKER,"Uh, she just went to meet your friend George."
S08E04,ELAINE,To meet George? I knew it. Where did they go?
S08E04,WORKER,"The park, why?"
S08E04,ELAINE,"Don't you see? George is in the bloodstream! You stay away from him, too!"
S08E04,JERRY,What do you mean he's bootlegging the movie?
S08E04,KRAMER,"Well, it's a perfectly legitimate business."
S08E04,JERRY,It's not legitimate.
S08E04,KRAMER,It's a business.
S08E04,JERRY,Where did you meet this guy?
S08E04,KRAMER,He's a friend of a friend. You know Corky Ramarez up on 94th Street? One day he and I are playing Pachinco--
S08E04,JERRY,Kramer. (boom sound)
S08E04,KRAMER,"Man, we're missin' the Death Blow!"
S08E04,JERRY,I don't believe this. (They run into theater)
S08E04,ANNA,You know I'm not supposed to be talking to you.
S08E04,GEORGE,"No one's putting a gun to your head. Do I, uh, scare you?"
S08E04,ANNA,No... a little. Nice car.
S08E04,GEORGE,"Yeah, she's a sweet ride."
S08E04,ANNA,Is that your orthopedic back pillow?
S08E04,GEORGE,Maybe.
S08E04,ANNA,Well is it or isn't it?
S08E04,GEORGE,Guess not.
S08E04,ELAINE,(To George) Stay away from her.
S08E04,GEORGE,I didn't do nothin'.
S08E04,ELAINE,(To Anna) Get in the car.
S08E04,ANNA,But...
S08E04,ELAINE,"You heard me young lady, get in the car. (To George) And you, you should know better. I don't want you infecting my staff."
S08E04,GEORGE,Lighten up.
S08E04,KRAMER,"Go get 'em, Death Blow! (To Brody) You okay?"
S08E04,(Movie Voice,"So Death Blow, we meet again ...)"
S08E04,BRODY,"Uh, I got a cramp."
S08E04,KRAMER,"Well, it's no wonder. You ate that entire bag of candy."
S08E04,BRODY,"Uh, there it goes again. Kramer, you gotta drive me home."
S08E04,JERRY,"Hey, what is going on over there?"
S08E04,BRODY,"Jerry, finish shooting the movie for me."
S08E04,JERRY,Are you nuts? There's no way I'm holding that thing.
S08E04,KRAMER,"Jerry, if the man is in pain..."
S08E04,JERRY,"Yeah well, maybe if he didn't lick his fingers before he reached in the bag we would've eaten some. Serves him right."
S08E04,BRODY,(pulls out a gun) What are you some kind of tough guy?
S08E04,KRAMER,"Okay. Let's everybody just relax. Jerry, take the camera."
S08E04,JERRY,"All right, I'm, i,m takin' the camera."
S08E04,KRAMER,"(To Brody) C'mon, let's go."
S08E04,JERRY,Oh man...
S08E04,KRAMER,"Hey man, so how was the rest of Death Blow?"
S08E04,JERRY,How was the rest of Death Blow?
S08E04,KRAMER,"Yeah, who got the final Death Blow, 'cause I thought that Hawaiian guy, he had it comin' to him!"
S08E04,JERRY,"Kramer, you make me get a ticket for this friend of yours and then the guy forces me to bootleg the movie at gun point!"
S08E04,KRAMER,"He's quite a character, isn't he?"
S08E04,JERRY,"You know, he came by here at 3 o'clock in the morning to pick up the tape. I was scared out of my mind!"
S08E04,KRAMER,I got it. Yep.
S08E04,BRODY,Brody.
S08E04,KRAMER,Come on up. It's Brody.
S08E04,JERRY,"What are you, crazy? I don't want to see this guy again."
S08E04,KRAMER,"Jerry, you did him a favor. He probably wants to come up and thank you."
S08E04,JERRY,What if I didn't do it right?
S08E04,KRAMER,It's your first time. He'll understand.
S08E04,JERRY,People with guns don't understand. That's why they get guns. Too many misunderstandings.
S08E04,KRAMER,"Hey, Brody!"
S08E04,JERRY,Hi.
S08E04,BRODY,"Jerry, I have to talk to you about the tape."
S08E04,JERRY,Yeah.
S08E04,BRODY,I've never seen such beautiful work.
S08E04,JERRY,What?
S08E04,BRODY,"(con,t) You're a genius. The zoom-ins, the framing. I was enchanted."
S08E04,JERRY,"Well, I did the best I could."
S08E04,BRODY,"I got another project for you. It's a movie called Cry Cry Again. I was gonna give it to one of my other guys, but it's an arty movie and quite frankly, they don't have the sensibility."
S08E04,BRODY,May I use your phone?
S08E04,KRAMER,Uh yeah. It's under the couch.
S08E04,KRAMER,Look at you! You've got another gig! Uhh.
S08E04,JERRY,I don't want another gig! I'm not doin' this.
S08E04,KRAMER,"But you have a gift. Jerry, this is not your little comedy act. We're talkin' feature films."
S08E04,JERRY,We're talkin' federal crime here.
S08E04,BRODY,(To Jerry) I'll expect that tape by three o'clock tomorrow. (To Kramer) May I borrow this? (Holding baseball bat)
S08E04,KRAMER,"Sure, do you need a glove?"
S08E04,BRODY,Nah.
S08E04,WORKER,"I pressed through the rushes and there, the native dancers whirled before me limbs flailing, arms akimbo, feet kicking up dust... (All workers laugh)"
S08E04,ELAINE,What? What is so funny?
S08E04,ANNA,"Sorry, I got hung up."
S08E04,ELAINE,At Yankee Stadium?
S08E04,ANNA,This? It's mine.
S08E04,ELAINE,"Oh really? 'Cause it looks a little big for you. It looks like something a short, stocky, slow-witted, bald man might wear."
S08E04,ANNA,He's not stocky.
S08E04,ELAINE,Who did that? Who did that?!?
S08E04,KRAMER,"(laughing) The French guy fell off his bike. Oh man, that's precious. (eats popcorn)"
S08E04,JERRY,"No, no, no, no, no, no, no! What were you thinking when you shot this?"
S08E04,KRAMER,That's fine.
S08E04,JERRY,Do you even know what this scene is about?
S08E04,KRAMER,It's about a guy buying a loaf of bread.
S08E04,JERRY,"No, bread is his soul. He's trying to buy back a loaf of his soul."
S08E04,KRAMER,Wha? Where?
S08E04,JERRY,Kramer there is no way you're giving this tape to Brody and telling him I shot it.
S08E04,KRAMER,"Nah, nah, he's not going to know the difference."
S08E04,JERRY,"I don't care about Brody. I was up on 96th Street today, there was a kid couldn't have been more than ten years old. He was asking a street vendor if he had any other bootlegs as good as Death Blow. That's who I care about. The little kid who needs bootlegs, because his parent or guardian won't let him see the excessive violence and strong sexual content you and I take for granted."
S08E04,KRAMER,"So you'll do the movie? (Jerry watches the movie Kramer shot - we hear Kramer, on the tape say 'Ah man, I sat in gum')"
S08E04,JERRY,I have to. But I'm gonna need to storyboard this whole thing. Where are my magic markers?
S08E04,KRAMER,Right here. (Elaine enters)
S08E04,ELAINE,"Well, I have lost complete control of my staff. Why did I let George go to that party? I mean, we were having so much fun. We were wining, we were dining, we were dancing. (She starts dancing, Kramer flips out) What?"
S08E04,KRAMER,(He shows her) This umpf thing.
S08E04,ELAINE,It's dancing.
S08E04,KRAMER,"No, no. That ain't dancing, Sally."
S08E04,ELAINE,I dance fine.
S08E04,KRAMER,You stink. (He exits)
S08E04,ELAINE,"He doesn't know what he's talkin' about. (Jerry fake laughs) Jer? Jerry, I'm a good dancer, right?"
S08E04,JERRY,I forgot to make my bed. (He tries to get away)
S08E04,ELAINE,"Jerry, do I stink?"
S08E04,JERRY,"All right, you're beyond stink."
S08E04,ELAINE,But I really enjoy dancing.
S08E04,JERRY,"And that's not helpin' either. That's why you're havin' trouble with your staff, not because of George."
S08E04,ELAINE,It's that bad?
S08E04,JERRY,"Have you ever seen yourself? (She starts dancing) Ah, ah, please, please. Not in my home. I gotta go throw this stuff in the laundry. I'll be right back."
S08E04,VOICE,I have George Costanza still holding.
S08E04,ELAINE,"George, hi. I have Anna here. There's something I wanna say to both of you."
S08E04,GEORGE,"Yo, Anna."
S08E04,ANNA,"Hi, George. What're you up to?"
S08E04,GEORGE,(Ironing) You don't wanna know.
S08E04,ELAINE,"Uh, well, listen. I feel really horrible about trying to keep you two apart and I just wanted to apologize."
S08E04,GEORGE,"What, wha, what're you talkin' about?"
S08E04,ELAINE,"Well, George, I just want you to hear me say to Anna that you're a good and decent person."
S08E04,GEORGE,"Pick up the phone, Elaine. Pick it up!"
S08E04,ELAINE,I never should have given Anna the impression--
S08E04,GEORGE,"Pick it up, pick it up!"
S08E04,ELAINE,"--that you're a bad seed, I mean, you're a fine seed."
S08E04,GEORGE,"Elaine, get off the speaker! (Elaine picks up phone)"
S08E04,ELAINE,What?
S08E04,GEORGE,You are ruinin' everything.
S08E04,ELAINE,I'm trying to help. Why are you being so difficult?
S08E04,GEORGE,"Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. That's it. More of that, difficult. I'm a difficult seed."
S08E04,ELAINE,"George, I don't have time for this. Uh, Anna, do you wanna talk to George?"
S08E04,ANNA,"Um, no, I don't think so."
S08E04,ELAINE,"No, she doesn't want to. Okay, bye, George. We'll see ya."
S08E04,GEORGE,I'm a bad man!
S08E04,BRODY,So where's the tape?
S08E04,JERRY,"No, I didn't shoot this one. I'm just scouting the location."
S08E04,BRODY,I need the tape.
S08E04,JERRY,"You'll get your tape. But here's what I'm gonna need. I'm gonna need three cameras, two on the floor, one in the balcony. And I want headsets for the guys runnin' 'em. I wanna be able to talk to 'em."
S08E04,BRODY,Are you out of your mind?
S08E04,JERRY,Kramer...
S08E04,KRAMER,"I know, Jerry. It's okay. (Jerry steps aside) Yeah, look, Brody. Uh, Jerry wants to do the bootleg. He's dyin' to do it. But if you don't make him happy, the work suffers. And then, nobody's happy."
S08E04,BRODY,Just shoot the damn thing so I can get it out on the street!
S08E04,JERRY,"All right. That's it, I can't work like this."
S08E04,KRAMER,Jerry...
S08E04,JERRY,I'm off the project. (He exits)
S08E04,KRAMER,Jerry!
S08E04,BRODY,I want the tape.
S08E04,KRAMER,Yeah.
S08E04,GEORGE,"Well, I'm the good boy again. Can you believe that?"
S08E04,JERRY,They think they can get anyone to shoot these bootlegs.
S08E04,GEORGE,Anna actually has respect for me now. (laughs/snorts) It's all over.
S08E04,JERRY,"Eh, the whole business has changed. It's all about money now. The sad thing is it's the kids that suffer. (Kramer enters)"
S08E04,KRAMER,"Listen, man. You gotta shoot this movie for me. Brody, he's a reasonable man, but he's insane!"
S08E04,JERRY,"Kramer, I'm not doin' this anymore. I don't know what I was thinking. It's illegal, it's dangerous..."
S08E04,GEORGE,Did you say dangerous?
S08E04,GEORGE,I'm a bootlegger.
S08E04,ANNA,You're a what?
S08E04,GEORGE,"I'm bootleggin' a movie, baby!"
S08E04,ANNA,Isn't that illegal?
S08E04,GEORGE,I can do hard time for this one. And community service!
S08E04,ANNA,Is this your FiberCon?
S08E04,GEORGE,(Takes it and throws it out window) Get outta my way!
S08E04,KRAMER,"Jerry, George got arrested."
S08E04,JERRY,What?
S08E04,KRAMER,"Yeah. He went down at the Beackman, he tried to lam, but they cheesed him."
S08E04,JERRY,Oh now I see. (Buzzer) Yeah.
S08E04,BRODY,"Brody, I'm comin' up."
S08E04,JERRY,What're we gonna do?
S08E04,KRAMER,"Well, I ah, gotta give him something. Come on, where's that tape I shot?"
S08E04,JERRY,I think that's it. (They play it and see Elaine dancing) Sweet fancy Moses!
S08E04,KRAMER,"Jerry, she taped over the whole ending! (Brody enters)"
S08E04,BRODY,Where's the tape?
S08E04,JERRY,"Uh, well. It, uh..."
S08E04,BRODY,Is that it?
S08E04,KRAMER,"Uh, yeah, yeah. Here it is, Brody. One copy of Cry Cry Again."
S08E04,BRODY,How'd it turn out?
S08E04,KRAMER + JERRY,Uh... great.
S08E04,KRAMER,Although the whole story kinda comes apart at the end there.
S08E04,JERRY,"Yeah, out of nowhere there's this lone dancer who appears to be injured."
S08E04,KRAMER,"Yeah, it's a disturbing image."
S08E04,JERRY,"Yeah, so you cry... and when you see the dancing, you cry again."
S08E04,ANNA,"(George is crying) It's all right, George. You'll just pay a fine and that'll be it."
S08E04,GEORGE,Why did the policeman have to yell at me like that? (Elaine enters)
S08E04,ELAINE,Anna...
S08E04,ANNA,"Oh, Elaine, thanks for picking me up. I can explain everything."
S08E04,ELAINE,"All right. Well, we'll talk about it tomorrow at the office. (Mr. Costanza enters)"
S08E04,FRANK,"Okay, where's my boy?"
S08E04,GEORGE,Oh my God.
S08E04,FRANK,"I'm sitting at home, reading a periodical, and this is the call I get? My son is a bootlegger? (He hits George in the head)"
S08E04,GEORGE,Ow! Dad...
S08E04,FRANK,"Who put you up to this, was it her?"
S08E04,ELAINE,All right. Wait a minute. I think you've got it backwards.
S08E04,FRANK,My George isn't clever enough to hatch a scheme like this.
S08E04,ELAINE,You got that right.
S08E04,FRANK,What the hell does that mean?
S08E04,ELAINE,That means whatever the hell you want it to mean.
S08E04,FRANK,You sayin' you want a piece of me?
S08E04,ELAINE,I could drop you like a bag of dirt.
S08E04,FRANK,You wanna piece of me? You got it! (They begin to fight)
S08E04,JERRY,"But he's an old man, Elaine."
S08E04,ELAINE,"Well, he wrote the check, and I cashed it."
S08E04,JERRY,"(Seeing a street vendor) Hey, it's the bootlegged Death Blow that I shot."
S08E04,ELAINE,"Oh, Cry Cry Again, I wanna see that."
S08E04,JERRY,No you don't.
S08E04,MAN,You shot Death Blow?
S08E04,JERRY,Yeah.
S08E04,MAN,That was brilliant.
S08E04,JERRY,Thank you. (They continue walking)
S08E04,ELAINE,You were big.
S08E04,JERRY,I'm still big. It's the bootlegs that got small. So how are things at the office? Back to normal?
S08E04,ELAINE,"Yeah, pretty much. Although I still get the vibe every once in a while."
S08E04,JERRY,I wouldn't worry about it. (People on sidewalk behind them are doing her dance as they go)
S08E05,KRAMER,"Well, I really miss the Bermuda Triangle."
S08E05,NEWMAN,I guess there's not much action down there these days.
S08E05,KRAMER,"Oh, there's action. There's plenty of action. That damned alien autopsy is stealing all the headlines."
S08E05,NEWMAN,"Yeah, tell me about it."
S08E05,KRAMER,"See, what they gotta do is loose a plane or a Greenpeace boat in there. See, that would get the triangle going again."
S08E05,NEWMAN,"What keeps the water in there? I mean, why doesn't it disappear?"
S08E05,KRAMER,What would be the point in taking the water?
S08E05,NEWMAN,It's gorgeous water. (pause) Do we own Bermuda?
S08E05,KRAMER,No. It belongs to the British.
S08E05,NEWMAN,Lucky krauts.
S08E05,KRAMER,"So, what do you think about that alien autopsy?"
S08E05,NEWMAN,"Oh, that's real."
S08E05,KRAMER,I think so too.
S08E05,ATTENDANT,The doctor will be with you in a moment.
S08E05,ELAINE,Difficult?
S08E05,DOCTOR,Elaine. You shouldn't be reading that. So tell me about this rash of yours.
S08E05,ELAINE,"Well it's, it's..... You know I noticed that somebody wrote in my chart that I was difficult in January of 92 and I have to tell you that I remember that appointment exactly. You see this nurse asked me to put a gown on but it was a mole on my shoulder and I specifically wore a tank top so I wouldn't have to put a gown on. You know there made of paper."
S08E05,DOCTOR,Well that was a long time ago. How about if I just erase it. Now about that rash......
S08E05,ELAINE,But it was in pen. You fake erase.
S08E05,DOCTOR,All right Miss Benes. This doesn't look to serious. You'll be fine.
S08E05,ELAINE,What are you writing? Doctor.
S08E05,SHEILA,Here you go.
S08E05,GEORGE,Thanks.
S08E05,SHEILA,I hope you got that mustard stain out of your shirt.
S08E05,GEORGE,Ohhhhhh
S08E05,JERRY,No. All you got to do is jiggle it with this screwdriver.
S08E05,GEORGE,Smile
S08E05,JERRY,What are you doing?
S08E05,GEORGE,"I meet this women, Sheila. She works down at the one hour photo pace. She's got this incredible smile. Like she's got extra teeth or something"
S08E05,JERRY,Extra teeth. I love that look.
S08E05,GEORGE,"Hey check this out. I go to pick up my pictures and she says "" I hope you got that mustard stain out of your shirt."""
S08E05,JERRY,What mustard stain?
S08E05,GEORGE,Don't you see. She's looking at my pictures.
S08E05,JERRY,Why did you take a picture of a mustard stain?
S08E05,GEORGE,That's got nothing to do with it.
S08E05,JERRY,I see. She's looking.
S08E05,GEORGE,Yesssss.
S08E05,KRAMER,"Hey, you got to get this thing fixed."
S08E05,JERRY,They've tried to fix it. But it keeps coming back the same.
S08E05,KRAMER,Would you like a refund?
S08E05,JERRY,Well I can't the warranty expired two years ago.
S08E05,KRAMER,Would you be interested?
S08E05,JERRY,Well how are you going.....
S08E05,KRAMER,Would you?
S08E05,JERRY,I guess I would.
S08E05,KRAMER,"Yeah, yeah."
S08E05,ELAINE,You are not going to believe what happened to me at the doctors office today.
S08E05,JERRY,Not the gown again.
S08E05,ELAINE,"No, no. I was looking at my chart and it said I was difficult. Why would they write that?"
S08E05,JERRY,They have gotten to know you.
S08E05,ELAINE,Then the doctor writes more stuff down and doesn't even look at my rash.
S08E05,GEORGE,Why don't you find a doctor that doesn't know your difficult.
S08E05,ELAINE,Oh come on. I'm not difficult. I'm easy.
S08E05,JERRY,Why because you dress casual and sleep with a lot of guys.
S08E05,ELAINE,Listen to me you little shi........
S08E05,GEORGE,Smile.
S08E05,DOCTOR,Well Elaine you really didn't have to put on the gown.
S08E05,ELAINE,Oh it's my pleasure. I love these. In fact I got one at home. It's perfect when you just want to throw something on.
S08E05,DOCTOR,All rightly. Let me just review your history before we begin.
S08E05,ELAINE,Where did you get my chart?
S08E05,DOCTOR,From your last doctor. It's a standard procedure.
S08E05,ELAINE,You know I can tell you my whole history. Let's just.......
S08E05,DOCTOR,Okay. Let's take a look. Well that doesn't look to serious. You'll be fine.
S08E05,ELAINE,"Please, please. It's really, really itchy."
S08E05,POSTAL WORKER DANNY,Seinfeld?
S08E05,JERRY,Yeah.
S08E05,POSTAL WORKER DANNY,I got a package for you. Sign here.
S08E05,JERRY,Who's it from?
S08E05,POSTAL WORKER DANNY,No return address.
S08E05,JERRY,What if I don't want it?
S08E05,POSTAL WORKER,Are you refusing delivery?
S08E05,JERRY,Maybe I am.
S08E05,POSTAL WORKER DANNY,Why would you do that?
S08E05,JERRY,I've never done it before.
S08E05,POSTAL WORKER DANNY,Why start now?
S08E05,JERRY,Why not?
S08E05,POSTAL WORKER DANNY,All right.
S08E05,GEORGE,Why did you refuse the package. Everybody loves a package.
S08E05,JERRY,I don't know it was weird. Crazy printing. I don't know who it was from.
S08E05,GEORGE,What do you think it's a bomb?
S08E05,JERRY,It's not totally impossible.
S08E05,GEORGE,Oh the ego on you.
S08E05,JERRY,Why can't I be bombable?
S08E05,GEORGE,Who's going to bomb you. An airline for all the stupid little peanut jokes.
S08E05,JERRY,I suppose you think your bombable.
S08E05,GEORGE,Hey. There is a couple of people that wouldn't mind having me out of the way.
S08E05,JERRY,There's more than a couple.
S08E05,GEORGE,Hey. Check these out. I just picked them up from Sheila. She must have loved these.
S08E05,JERRY,You don't have a Mercedes.
S08E05,GEORGE,I know. I just sort of leaned on it so it would look like it was mine.
S08E05,JERRY,The driver seems a little put out.
S08E05,GEORGE,No. He was fine with it. Check that out.
S08E05,JERRY,Is that Burt Reynolds?
S08E05,GEORGE,Wax Museum.
S08E05,JERRY,Oh.
S08E05,GEORGE,Oh. What is this?
S08E05,JERRY,That's a lot of skin.
S08E05,GEORGE,This must be Sheila from the photo place.
S08E05,JERRY,You can barely see her face.
S08E05,GEORGE,She must have slipped it in here.
S08E05,KRAMER,I I I
S08E05,GEORGE,Photo store Sheila.
S08E05,KRAMER,Well hello Photo store Sheila.
S08E05,GEORGE,All right. I will see you boys later.
S08E05,JERRY,Where are you going?
S08E05,GEORGE,To ask her out.
S08E05,KRAMER,"No, no. Your not playing the game."
S08E05,GEORGE,What game?
S08E05,KRAMER,"She goes to these lengths to entice you and your only response is "" Gee I really like your picture. Would you like to go out on a date with me please. """
S08E05,GEORGE,No good?
S08E05,KRAMER,"George. It's the timeless art of seduction. You got to join in the dance. She sends you an enticing photo, you send her one right back."
S08E05,GEORGE,"Oh, I don't know."
S08E05,KRAMER,Well as you know I've always been something of a photog.
S08E05,JERRY,Oh yeah I like this idea.
S08E05,UNCLE LEO,Hey Danny. Hello. How are you?
S08E05,POSTAL WORKER DANNY,Hey Leo. Leo what's up with your nephew. He wouldn't except his package.
S08E05,UNCLE LEO,Oh He wants it. He's just trying to be funny. Yeah I'll sign it .
S08E05,ELAINE,And then he starts writing on my chart.
S08E05,GEORGE,Well why don't you get a hold of it and change what you don't like.
S08E05,ELAINE,You can't change your chart. It's your chart.
S08E05,GEORGE,I am in and out of my personnel file at work all the time.
S08E05,ELAINE,You are!?!
S08E05,GEORGE,"Hey. I've kept the same job for more than two years. It's not luck. Elaine, have you ever sent a racy photograph of yourself to anyone?"
S08E05,ELAINE,Yeah. I sent one to everyone I know. Remember my Christmas card.
S08E05,GEORGE,Oh yeah the nipple. But besides that. How did you feel about Kramer's work?
S08E05,ELAINE,Actually I thought he was very professional.
S08E05,GEORGE,So it was a good experience.
S08E05,ELAINE,Oh yeah. In fact I like the picture so much I cropped out the nipple and am using as my health club ID.
S08E05,GEORGE,Nice.
S08E05,ELAINE,Yeah it is nice actually.
S08E05,ELAINE,I need to see Dr. Burke right away. This rash is spreading.
S08E05,ATTENDANT,"He can't see you Miss Benes, he's busy."
S08E05,ELAINE,Oh come on. Have some compassion. Okay well I hope it's contagious
S08E05,ELAINE,Come on. Move. (elevator doors reopen; Dr. Burke and two orderlies are revealed) Oh hi Dr. Burke. I didn't know if uh....
S08E05,DR. BURKE,The chart Miss Benes.
S08E05,ELAINE,Oh please no more.
S08E05,JERRY,Hey
S08E05,GEORGE,Where's Kramer?
S08E05,JERRY,He went to get some steak sauce. Why?
S08E05,GEORGE,Personal matter.
S08E05,JERRY,Hello
S08E05,UNCLE LEO,Jerry! It's your Uncle Leo! Hello!
S08E05,JERRY,Hello Leo. You don't have to yell.
S08E05,UNCLE LEO,I got your package.
S08E05,JERRY,How did you get my package?
S08E05,UNCLE LEO,What should I do with it?
S08E05,JERRY,I don't know what you should do with it.
S08E05,GEORGE,Tell him to open it.
S08E05,JERRY,I am not going to treat my uncle like a bomb defusing robot.
S08E05,UNCLE LEO,"Jerry, Your cousin Jeffrey is in the Parks Production of ""The Mikado"". I want you to go see it with me."
S08E05,JERRY,Open the package Leo.
S08E05,UNCLE LEO,Okay. Opening.
S08E05,JERRY,Opening.
S08E05,(Through the phone,BOOM!!!)
S08E05,ELAINE,So it wasn't a bomb.
S08E05,JERRY,"No, No bomb."
S08E05,ELAINE,Well then what?
S08E05,JERRY,Oh stupid Leo was using one of those oven cleaners. He left the canister in there and the pilot light was on. The whole thing blew up.
S08E05,ELAINE,But he's okay?
S08E05,JERRY,"Yeah but the explosion singed off his eyebrows, mustache everything. He's all smooth now. Look's like a seal."
S08E05,ELAINE,Yeah I am still holding.
S08E05,JERRY,Is this my stereo?
S08E05,KRAMER,Hey you got it.
S08E05,JERRY,What happened to my stereo? It's all smashed up.
S08E05,KRAMER,That's right. Now it looks like it was broken during shipping and I insured it for $400.
S08E05,JERRY,But you were supposed to get me a refund.
S08E05,KRAMER,You can't get a refund. Your warranty expired two years ago.
S08E05,JERRY,So were going to make the Post Office pay for my new stereo?
S08E05,KRAMER,It's just a write off for them.
S08E05,JERRY,How is it a write off?
S08E05,KRAMER,They just write it off.
S08E05,JERRY,Write it off what?
S08E05,KRAMER,Jerry all these big companies they write off everything
S08E05,JERRY,You don't even know what a write off is.
S08E05,KRAMER,Do you?
S08E05,JERRY,No. I don't.
S08E05,KRAMER,But they do and they are the ones writing it off.
S08E05,JERRY,I wish I just had the last twenty seconds of my life back.
S08E05,ELAINE,"What?!? He doesn't have one appointment this whole month!?! Oh come on. I am dying here man. Hello, hello."
S08E05,JERRY,Still no luck
S08E05,ELAINE,Jerry I am at doctor Zimmerman. I am at the end of the alphabet.
S08E05,JERRY,There's no Zorn or Zoutraph.
S08E05,ELAINE,There on vacation. Every doctor in this city seems to know who I am .
S08E05,JERRY,Hey what about Dr. Resnick My Uncle Leo is going to see him tomorrow .
S08E05,ELAINE,Dr. Resnick. He's not listed.
S08E05,JERRY,He's not that good.
S08E05,GEORGE,Elaine said your pretty good at this stuff.
S08E05,KRAMER,Oh yeah. Elaine was a fun project. I enjoyed working with her.
S08E05,GEORGE,You don't have your own camera.
S08E05,KRAMER,Uh no. Look at this. Okay yeah this looks good and I like what your wearing.
S08E05,GEORGE,I feel fat.
S08E05,KRAMER,"No, no. You're stoked. The camera loves stokedness. Look were not going to do anything that makes you feel uncomfortable. The key word is tasteful. Now I want you to relax and have fun because your a fun guy. All right let's do it. Okay come on. Feel the beat. Feel the beat. You know you got some real strong pecks but it's hard to tell under that T-shirt."
S08E05,GEORGE,Well do you want me to take it off?
S08E05,KRAMER,I don't know it's up to you.
S08E05,GEORGE,Do you think it would be better if I did?
S08E05,KRAMER,It might be. I mean whatever you want.
S08E05,GEORGE,ALL RIGHT!!
S08E05,KRAMER,"That's it George. Come on, come on. Give it to me. Come on,work it. Work it. Yeah be a man, be a man."
S08E05,KRAMER,You are a lover boy!!
S08E05,JERRY,Oh yeah. This can't miss.
S08E05,ELAINE,Hello.
S08E05,GUY,Is this Elaine Marie Benes?
S08E05,ELAINE,Yes. Who it this?
S08E05,GUY,We are with the American Medical Association. Can you confirm the correct spelling of your last name? Is it B-e-n-e-s.
S08E05,ELAINE,Yeah. What is this all about
S08E05,GUY,Good bye.
S08E05,ELAINE,"Hello, hello."
S08E05,GUY,What?
S08E05,ELAINE,Oh uh uh...
S08E05,GUY,Get off the line. Were trying to make another call.
S08E05,UNCLE LEO,Elaine. Hello. What are you doing here?
S08E05,ELAINE,Leo. Has the doctor been in yet?
S08E05,UNCLE LEO,No. I am going to ask him about my eyebrows.
S08E05,ELAINE,"Okay listen Leo. Your hairless, your scared. When the doctor comes in let me do the talking. Okay."
S08E05,DR. RESNICK,Leo. I heard you had a little mishap.
S08E05,UNCLE LEO,It was a fireball.
S08E05,ELAINE,I should have never left him alone.
S08E05,DR. RESNICK,And who are you?
S08E05,ELAINE,I am his nurse... Poloma.
S08E05,UNCLE LEO,You're not my nurse.
S08E05,ELAINE,He has good days and bad.
S08E05,DR. RESNICK,What seems to be the problem?
S08E05,UNCLE LEO,Are my eyebrows going to grow back?
S08E05,ELAINE,And he's has a bit of a rash.
S08E05,DR. RESNICK,Really.
S08E05,ELAINE,Yeah.
S08E05,DR. RESNICK,Well there's been a bit of that going around lately. Will you excuse me Poloma. I just need to get some ointment.
S08E05,ELAINE,"I don't like this, it is to easy."
S08E05,UNCLE LEO,Elaine...
S08E05,ELAINE,Shut up! I think he's on to us.
S08E05,UNCLE LEO,Elaine what about my eyebrows?
S08E05,ELAINE,Shhhhhh. Here.
S08E05,JERRY,I don't like this Kramer. Will it be much longer?
S08E05,ATTENDANT,I am sorry. It looks like the claim has been red flagged. Your under investigation.
S08E05,JERRY,Investigation?
S08E05,NEWMAN,Hello Jerry.
S08E05,JERRY,Hello Newman.
S08E05,NEWMAN,Kramer you might as well run along. Jerry might be a while. Suspicion of mail fraud.
S08E05,KRAMER,Mail fraud. Your in a lot of trouble buddy.
S08E05,DR. RESNICK,I got your ointment. Where's your nurse?
S08E05,UNCLE LEO,She left.
S08E05,DR. RESNICK,No need to get angry. Calm down.
S08E05,UNCLE LEO,I am calm.
S08E05,DR. RESNICK,Leo I don't care for your demeanor.
S08E05,UNCLE LEO,Demeanor?
S08E05,DR. RESNICK,Now your just being difficult.
S08E05,UNCLE LEO,What are you writing?
S08E05,GEORGE,So I really liked the pictures I picked up here yesterday.
S08E05,SHEILA,I am glad George.
S08E05,GEORGE,And here's a roll that I think you may enjoy.
S08E05,SHEILA,Great.
S08E05,GEORGE,Shall we say an hour.
S08E05,SHEILA,Hey Ron I got to go to lunch. Can you do a roll?
S08E05,RON,No problem.
S08E05,SHEILA,By the way. You know that model that is always in here. She's missing one of her lingerie shots. Have you seen it?
S08E05,RON,No.
S08E05,NEWMAN,All right. Then let me ask you this. Didn't you find it interesting that your friend had the foresight to purchase postal insurance for your stereo. Huh. I mean parcels are rarely damaged during shipping.
S08E05,JERRY,Define rarely.
S08E05,NEWMAN,Frequently.
S08E05,JERRY,Are we about throw here Newman?
S08E05,NEWMAN,It's pretty hot under these lights huh Seinfeld. Pretty....... Hot .
S08E05,JERRY,Actually I am quite comfortable.
S08E05,NEWMAN,Can I have a sip?
S08E05,JERRY,No.
S08E05,NEWMAN,Not going to play ball. Huh all right. Admit it that stereo was all ready busted.
S08E05,JERRY,You can't prove anything.
S08E05,NEWMAN,Is this or is this not your signature?
S08E05,JERRY,No in a matter of fact it isn't.
S08E05,NEWMAN,Uncle Leo? This case is closed pending further evidence. Jerry.
S08E05,ELAINE,Get in there. Get chart. Get out. You got it.
S08E05,KRAMER,Yeah let me borrow your scarf.
S08E05,ELAINE,This.
S08E05,KRAMER,Yeah. All right one chart coming up.
S08E05,ELAINE,Okay.
S08E05,KRAMER,Bennette right?
S08E05,ELAINE,Benes. My last name is Benes you jackass. Yeah.
S08E05,NEWMAN,"Jerry, Jerry, Jerry, Jerry, Jerry, Jerry, Jerry, Jerry, Jerry."
S08E05,KRAMER,I like what you've done with that.
S08E05,ATTENDANT,May I help you?
S08E05,KRAMER,"Yes, yes. I am Dr. Vanostran from the clinic. I need Elaine Benes chart. She's a patient of mine and she's not going to make it. It's uh very bad very messy."
S08E05,ATTENDANT,I see and what clinic is that again?
S08E05,KRAMER,That's correct.
S08E05,ATTENDANT,Excuse me.
S08E05,KRAMER,From The Hoffer-Mandale Clinic in Belgium.
S08E05,ATTENDANT,Really?
S08E05,KRAMER,The Netherlands?
S08E05,ELAINE,Where's my chart? Did you get it?
S08E05,KRAMER,No.
S08E05,ELAINE,What? What happened?
S08E05,KRAMER,I don't know. But now they got a chart on me.
S08E05,SHEILA,I don't know where they could be.
S08E05,GEORGE,Can't find them. That's marvelous. The dance continues.
S08E05,SHEILA,Well if I find them I'll call you.
S08E05,GEORGE,And maybe we could go out and do something.
S08E05,SHEILA,Sure.
S08E05,RON,Hello.
S08E05,GEORGE,Hi.
S08E05,SHEILA,So the little guy finally asked me out.
S08E05,RON,Really?
S08E05,SHEILA,Hey I can't find his photo's anywhere.
S08E05,RON,Oh you know what happened. Some guy from the Post Office confiscated them. He left his card.
S08E05,SHEILA,Newman?
S08E05,GEORGE,I don't know what Newman wanted to see me for.
S08E05,NEWMAN,"Gentlemen, gentlemen. I am so happy to see you both. There is just some inconsistencies I'd like to straighten out."
S08E05,JERRY,I'm clean and you know it.
S08E05,NEWMAN,Clean? Hardly. This looks like a man that isn't happy with his stereo performance.
S08E05,JERRY,Where did you get that?
S08E05,GEORGE,I think that's one of mine.
S08E05,NEWMAN,It looks like your breaking into it like an otter breaking into a clad.
S08E05,JERRY,I don't know about that but I'm sure there is a explanation.
S08E05,NEWMAN,Yes. It's called mail fraud. Oohhhh. How I've longed for this moment Seinfeld. The day when I would have the proof I needed to hall you out of your cushy lair and expose to the light of justice as the monster that you are. A monster so vile.....
S08E05,GUY,NEWMAN!!
S08E05,NEWMAN,There will be a small fine.
S08E05,JERRY,Okay.
S08E05,GEORGE,Can we go now?
S08E05,NEWMAN,Not so fast pretty boy. There is more to this sorted little affair.
S08E05,JERRY,Oh my god!!
S08E05,NEWMAN,This photo clearly indicates your involvement in some ill-conceived mail order pornography ring.As does this one found in the same disturbing packet.
S08E05,GEORGE,OH MY GOD!!!
S08E05,NEWMAN,We have some questions we'd like you to answer.
S08E05,JERRY,I have some questions of my own.
S08E05,SHEILA,"Hi. One of your mailmen....... Oh my god, George!?!"
S08E05,GEORGE,Listen Sheila it's not what you think. I put my trust into the wrong person. He said the key word was tasteful.
S08E05,JERRY,The timeless art of seduction.
S08E05,GEORGE,SHEILA!!!
S08E06,WOMAN,"Well I started out working in mortgage bonds, but I just found that so limiting."
S08E06,JERRY,My friend Kramer and I were discussing that same thing the other day. He was with Brant-Leland for a while.
S08E06,WOMAN,"Wow. Well then my mentor suggested that I move into equities, best move I ever made."
S08E06,JERRY,Mentor? You mean your boss.
S08E06,WOMAN,"Oh, no no no, Cynthia's just a successful businesswoman who's taken me under her wing."
S08E06,JERRY,Hmm. So Cynthia's your mentor.
S08E06,WOMAN,"And I'm her protg. You must have someone like that. You know, who guides you in your career path."
S08E06,JERRY,"Well, I like Gabe Kaplan."
S08E06,GEORGE,I still don't understand this. Abby has a mentor?
S08E06,JERRY,Yes. And the mentor advises the protg.
S08E06,GEORGE,Is there any money involved?
S08E06,JERRY,No.
S08E06,GEORGE,So what's in it for the mentor?
S08E06,JERRY,"Respect, admiration, prestige."
S08E06,GEORGE,Pssh. Would the protg pick up stuff for the mentor?
S08E06,JERRY,"I suppose if it was on the protg's way to the mentor, they might."
S08E06,GEORGE,Laundry? Dry cleaning?
S08E06,JERRY,"It's not a valet, it's a protg."
S08E06,GEORGE,"Alright. Listen, I gotta get some reading done. You mind if I do this here? I can't concentrate in my apartment."
S08E06,JERRY,(checking out George's textbook) Risk management?
S08E06,GEORGE,Yeah. Steinbrenner wants everyone in the front office to give a lecture in their area of business expertise.
S08E06,JERRY,Well what makes them think you're a risk management expert?
S08E06,GEORGE,I guess it's on my resume.
S08E06,JERRY,Hello?
S08E06,VOICE,Please hold for Elaine Benes.
S08E06,GEORGE,"You know what? I can't do this. I can't read books anymore; books on tape have ruined me, Jerry. I need that nice voice. This book has *my* voice. I hate my voice."
S08E06,JERRY,So get this book on tape.
S08E06,GEORGE,"You can't, it's a textbook."
S08E06,ELAINE,"Hey, Jer. Are you going to this Bob Sacamano party?"
S08E06,JERRY,Am I going? It was three nights ago.
S08E06,ELAINE,"What? You're kidding, I just got this invitation today. Oh, I was so excited. It's really a beautiful invitation."
S08E06,JERRY,"Oh, it was a lovely affair."
S08E06,ELAINE,"Wait a minute; this postmark is three weeks old. Man, this happens all the time. (Into intercom) Jeanine? Who the hell runs the mailroom?"
S08E06,JEANINE,Eddie Sherman.
S08E06,ELAINE,"Alright, send him up here."
S08E06,JERRY,You gonna do a little yelling?
S08E06,ELAINE,I'm gonna do a little firing.
S08E06,JERRY,"That is so cool, can you put me on the speaker?"
S08E06,ELAINE,"Oh yeah, sure. (hangs up) Gimme a break."
S08E06,JERRY,"Hey, Copernicus?"
S08E06,JEANINE,Eddie Sherman is here.
S08E06,ELAINE,"Oh, great. Send him in."
S08E06,EDDIE,You wanted to see me?
S08E06,ELAINE,"Eddie. Yes, um, I am so sorry but I'm afraid we're gonna have to... promote you."
S08E06,JERRY,"So, what did you say?"
S08E06,ELAINE,"Well, I called him all the way up to my office, so I had to tell him something important. So I promoted him."
S08E06,JERRY,What? What did you--
S08E06,ELAINE,Copywriter.
S08E06,JERRY,He's writing copy?
S08E06,ELAINE,Well it can't be any worse than the pointless drivel we normally churn out.
S08E06,KRAMER,Yowza yowza. Check it out.
S08E06,JERRY,(reading) Jewish singles night?
S08E06,KRAMER,I expect you both to be there.
S08E06,ELAINE,I'm not Jewish.
S08E06,KRAMER,Well neither am I.
S08E06,JERRY,Well why are you going?
S08E06,KRAMER,"I'm not, I'm running it."
S08E06,JERRY,What are you talking about?
S08E06,KRAMER,"Well Lomez, he usually runs it but he's in the Everglades."
S08E06,JERRY,Lomez is Jewish?
S08E06,KRAMER,"Oh yeah yeah yeah. Orthodox, Jerry. Old school."
S08E06,ELAINE,(reading) At the Knights of Columbus?
S08E06,KRAMER,"Yeah, Frank Costanza, he's getting me a room at his lodge. So Jerry, you know I'm really counting on you to come to this."
S08E06,JERRY,"Kramer, you know, I--"
S08E06,KRAMER,"No, Jerry, look I'm cooking all the food myself."
S08E06,ELAINE,(reading) A tempting schmear of authentic Jewish delicacies.
S08E06,KRAMER,Do you like tsimmis?
S08E06,ABBY,My mentor says the duck is outstanding here.
S08E06,JERRY,"I'm not really a duck fan, the skin seems sort of human."
S08E06,ABBY,"Oh! Look who's here, Cynthia!"
S08E06,CYNTHIA,"Hello, Abby."
S08E06,ABBY,"Hello. Jerry, this is Cynthia Pearlman, my mentor."
S08E06,JERRY,Hello.
S08E06,CYNTHIA,"Hi Jerry, nice to finally meet you."
S08E06,ABBY,"Well come join us, we could pull up a chair."
S08E06,CYNTHIA,"Great, my boyfriend's just parking the car. Actually, Jerry, you"
S08E06,JERRY,No kidding?
S08E06,CYNTHIA,Kenny Bania.
S08E06,JERRY,Bania?
S08E06,BANIA,"Hey, Jerry!! How's it going?! You gonna join us for dinner? The duck here's the best. The best, Jerry."
S08E06,GEORGE,"Excuse me, I'm sorry to bother you, I noticed that you have a textbook on tape. May I ask where you got that?"
S08E06,MAN,Reading for the Blind. They can get any book on tape.
S08E06,GEORGE,"I tell ya, I am hooked on these books on tape."
S08E06,MAN,"Oh, tell me about it. These things have ruined me for Braille."
S08E06,JERRY,Reading for the Blind?
S08E06,GEORGE,"I take an eye test; I flunk it, the next thing you know I am swinging to the sweet sounds of risk management."
S08E06,JERRY,"So, I finally met the mentor."
S08E06,GEORGE,What's she like? Impressive?
S08E06,JERRY,"Oh yeah, she's dating Bania."
S08E06,GEORGE,Bania?
S08E06,JERRY,Yeah. I had to spend two hours at dinner last night with that specimen.
S08E06,GEORGE,What did you have?
S08E06,JERRY,"Chicken, how could she look up to a person who voluntarily spends time with Bania?"
S08E06,GEORGE,Marsala?
S08E06,JERRY,"Piccata, if anything I should be dating a mentor and Bania should be setting pins in a bowling alley."
S08E06,JERRY,"Hey, good luck with that."
S08E06,GEORGE,Thank you.
S08E06,GEORGE,Dad.
S08E06,FRANK,"What are you wearing, an athletic sweat suit?"
S08E06,GEORGE,What are you doing here?
S08E06,KRAMER,"Well, he came by to pick up his check for the banquet hall. You know I got a hundred and eighty-three responses? Oh, it's gonna be a rager."
S08E06,JERRY,"Kramer, how are you gonna cook Jewish delicacies for a hundred and eighty-three people?"
S08E06,KRAMER,"Yeah, you're right. That's a lot of pupkitz. Hey Frank, you know anybody who can help me cook?"
S08E06,FRANK,"Cook? No, I don't know any cooks. I don't know anything about cooking!"
S08E06,KRAMER,What's the matter with him?
S08E06,GEORGE,"My dad was a cook during the Korean War. Something very bad happened, ever since you can't get him near a kitchen."
S08E06,KRAMER,Shell-shocked?
S08E06,GEORGE,"Oh yeah, but that has nothing to do with it."
S08E06,ELAINE,"That's good work, guys. That aught to do it for today."
S08E06,EDDIE,Wait. You didn't ask me about my ideas.
S08E06,ELAINE,"Oh, Eddie, well it's your first day."
S08E06,EDDIE,I'm ready.
S08E06,ELAINE,"Oh, okay."
S08E06,EDDIT,"(reading) It's a hot night. The mind races. You think about your knife; the only friend who hasn't betrayed you, the only friend who won't be dead by sun up. Sleep tight, mates, in your quilted Chambray nightshirts."
S08E06,ELAINE,What am I gonna do? He is a disaster.
S08E06,JERRY,"Well, if he's doing that bad, maybe he's in line for another promotion."
S08E06,ELAINE,"You know what? You are exactly right. That is what I should do, I should promote him. I'll give him another office on another floor and he can sit there with his nice title and his bayonet and stop freakin' me out."
S08E06,GEORGE,Nothing at all.
S08E06,DOCTOR,"Well George, your vision is quite impaired. If you'll just sign this insurance form, here's a pen."
S08E06,GEORGE,"You're a very handsome man, by the way."
S08E06,JERRY,What the hell is going on here?
S08E06,JERRY,What are you doing?
S08E06,KRAMER,"I got three kitchens going. I got brisket going at Newman's, I got kugel working at Mrs. Zamfino's, this is kreplach. Here, try some of this."
S08E06,JERRY,"No, I don't want to."
S08E06,KRAMER,"Eat, eat! You're skin and bones."
S08E06,KRAMER,Hah?
S08E06,JERRY,"Oh, this is awful."
S08E06,KRAMER,"Jerry, it's kreplach. It's an acquired taste, yeah."
S08E06,JERRY,Did you follow the recipe?
S08E06,KRAMER,The recipe was for four to six people; I had to multiply for a hundred and eighty-three people. I guess I got confused.
S08E06,JERRY,It tastes like dirt.
S08E06,KRAMER,"Well I also dropped it on the way over. Look I'm in trouble, I got no skills. I can't peel, I can't chop, I can't grate. I can't mince! I got no sense of flavor, obviously. You know, I gotta talk to Frank."
S08E06,JERRY,"Kramer, you can't talk to Frank."
S08E06,KRAMER,"No I gotta talk to him, I know that he can help me, Jerry."
S08E06,ABBY,I think there's a dead animal in the elevator.
S08E06,KRAMER,My stuffed cabbage!
S08E06,ABBY,"So, great dinner last night."
S08E06,JERRY,"Yeah, it was alright."
S08E06,ABBY,I told Cynthia we'd double with her and Bania Saturday and then catch his act.
S08E06,JERRY,"No. No, no way, no Bania."
S08E06,ABBY,What?
S08E06,JERRY,"Have you seen his act? He's got a twelve-minute bit about Ovaltine. He's a punk, a patsy, a hack."
S08E06,ABBY,Cynthia would not date a hack.
S08E06,JERRY,Would. Does. Is.
S08E06,ELAINE,"Before we get started, I am happy to tell you that Eddie Sherman is no longer writing for this catalog."
S08E06,ELAINE,"He's upstairs, I made him Director of Corporate Development."
S08E06,EMPLOYEE,You promoted him?
S08E06,ELAINE,"Well, no, I would hardly--"
S08E06,EMPLOYEE,I bust my hump ever day.
S08E06,ELAINE,Relax--
S08E06,EMPLOYEE,"As far as I'm concerned, you and your deranged protg can run the catalog by yourselves! I quit!"
S08E06,ELAINE,"Well, hey? Hey. Hey!!"
S08E06,VOICE,Chapter one. In order to manage risk we must first understand risk. How do you spot risk? How do you avoid risk and what makes it so risky?
S08E06,GEORGE,This guy sounds just like me.
S08E06,VOICE,"To understand risk, we must first define risk."
S08E06,GEORGE,This is horrible.
S08E06,VOICE,Risk is defined as--
S08E06,GEORGE,(banging the recorder) Stop it! Stop it!
S08E06,KRAMER,"C'mon Frank, I need you. I mean the war was fifty years ago."
S08E06,FRANK,"In my mind, there's a war still going on."
S08E06,KRAMER,"Alright, what happened, Frank? What is it that you can't get over?"
S08E06,FRANK,"Inchon, Korea, 1950. I was the best cook Uncle Sam ever saw, slinging hash for the Fighting 103rd. As we marched north, our supply lines were getting thin. One day a couple of GIs found a crate, inside were six hundred pounds of prime Texas steer. At least it once was prime. The Use date was three weeks past, but I was arrogant, I was brash, I thought if I used just the right spices, cooked it long enough..."
S08E06,KRAMER,What happened?
S08E06,FRANK,"I went too far. I over seasoned it. Men were keeling over all around me. I can still hear the retching, the screaming. I sent sixteen of my own men to the latrines that night. They were just boys."
S08E06,KRAMER,"Frank, you were a boy too. And it was war. It was a crazy time for everyone."
S08E06,FRANK,"Tell that to Bobby Colby. All that kid wanted to do was go home. Well he went home alright, with a crater in his colon the size of a cutlet. Had to sit him on a cork the eighteen-hour flight home!"
S08E06,KRAMER,"Frank, now listen to me. Two hundred Jewish singles need you. This is your chance to make it all right again."
S08E06,FRANK,"No. No, I'll never cook again! Never! Now get out of my house!! Get out. Go."
S08E06,JERRY,So you saw Bania's act?
S08E06,ABBY,He got two minutes into that Ovaltine thing and I just couldn't take it anymore.
S08E06,JERRY,"I told you, it's like getting beaten with a bag of oranges."
S08E06,ABBY,Why is he so obsessed with Ovaltine?
S08E06,JERRY,He just thinks that anything that dissolves in milk is funny.
S08E06,ABBY,"Anyway, Cynthia and I got into this big argument afterwards and I think it's over."
S08E06,JERRY,No more mentor?
S08E06,ABBY,Looks that way.
S08E06,JERRY,Well at least you and I are okay again.
S08E06,ABBY,Actually I was kind of thinking that maybe we shouldn't see each other for a while.
S08E06,JERRY,Why?
S08E06,ABBY,Well I'm feeling a little disoriented. It's just weird for me not to have an advisor.
S08E06,JERRY,I can tell you what to do.
S08E06,ABBY,"No, it's more than that."
S08E06,JERRY,I can tell you what to think.
S08E06,ABBY,I need someone I can trust.
S08E06,JERRY,Oh.
S08E06,GEORGE,"I got a big problem here, Jerry. The tapes are worthless."
S08E06,JERRY,"Kind of in the middle of something here, George."
S08E06,JERRY,George?
S08E06,ABBY,I gotta run anyway.
S08E06,JERRY,I can't believe you feel you really need a mentor.
S08E06,ABBY,I just need someone who can give me some kind of direction. I'll see ya.
S08E06,JERRY,"Yeah, see ya."
S08E06,JERRY,What's your problem.
S08E06,GEORGE,No problem.
S08E06,EDDIE,"Hey, I think I got something here. The Bengalese Galoshes."
S08E06,ELAINE,Oh.
S08E06,EDDIE,(reading) It's tough keeping your feet dry when you're kicking in a skull.
S08E06,ELAINE,"You know, Eddie, that might be just a tad harsh for womenswear."
S08E06,EDDIE,"Well, I'm not married to it."
S08E06,EDDIE,Dewy meadow.
S08E06,ESTELLE,Here's your omelet.
S08E06,FRANK,It's dry.
S08E06,ESTELLE,That's the way I always make it.
S08E06,FRANK,Well it sucks.
S08E06,ESTELLE,What did you say?
S08E06,FRANK,"Your meatloaf is mushy, your salmon croquettes are oily and your eggplant parmesan is a disgrace to this house!"
S08E06,ESTELLE,"Well that's too bad, because I'm the only one who cooks around here!"
S08E06,FRANK,"Not any more! Gimme that spatula! I'm back, baby!"
S08E06,ABBY,And you're sure with your busy schedule you'd have time to take on a protg?
S08E06,GEORGE,"I'll make time, because Abby, I was once like you; wide-eyed, naive, I didn't know the first thing about a subject as fundamental as risk management."
S08E06,ABBY,"I'm not familiar with that, you'll have to explain it to me."
S08E06,GEORGE,"I'll tell you what, why don't you read this book and let's just see if you can explain it to me."
S08E06,ABBY,Alright.
S08E06,GEORGE,Okay.
S08E06,BANIA,Hey Jerry.
S08E06,JERRY,"Oh, hey Bania."
S08E06,BANIA,Didja hear what happened? The mentor saw my act. She dumped me.
S08E06,JERRY,"Oh, that's too bad."
S08E06,BANIA,"Maybe she's right. Maybe I am a complete hack. I'm the absolute worst. The worst, Jerry."
S08E06,JERRY,"Well it's just that you got so many things with the milk. You got that Bosco bit then you got your Nestl's Quik bit, by the time you get to Ovaltine--"
S08E06,BANIA,You think you can give me a hand with my material?
S08E06,KRAMER,Hey.
S08E06,FRANK,You still need a cook?
S08E06,KRAMER,"Oh yeah, come on in, Frank."
S08E06,FRANK,Ya got T-Fal?
S08E06,KRAMER,Keflon.
S08E06,FRANK,No! Follow me.
S08E06,BANIA,"(reading) Why do they call it Ovaltine? The mug is round. The jar is round. They should call it round tine. That's gold, Jerry! Gold!"
S08E06,ELAINE,"Let's just replace ""hail of shrapnel"" and ""scar tissue"" with ""string of pearls"" and ""raspberry scones""."
S08E06,JERRY,George Costanza is your mentor?
S08E06,ABBY,"Yeah, he's great! I am learning so much."
S08E06,JERRY,About what? How to calculate five percent of a restaurant check?
S08E06,ABBY,You know what your problem is? You just have no respect for the mentor/mentor relationship.
S08E06,JERRY,"As a matter of fact, I happen to have a protg of my own."
S08E06,ABBY,Who?
S08E06,JERRY,A Mister Kenneth Bania.
S08E06,ABBY,Bania?
S08E06,JERRY,I'm gonna mentor this kid to the top.
S08E06,ABBY,"Huh, well, I don't think I want to date a mentor whose protg is a hack."
S08E06,JERRY,"Well, I don't think I want to date a protg whose mentor is a Costanza."
S08E06,ELAINE,"I don't know how we did it, but there's some kind of chemistry between us, we turned out one hell of a catalog."
S08E06,EDDIE,Cool.
S08E06,ELAINE,"Hey Ed, let me ask you something. What's with the fatigues and all the psychotic imagery? Huh?"
S08E06,EDDIE,I don't want to talk about it.
S08E06,ELAINE,"Come on, don't be a baby."
S08E06,EDDIE,"I went out on a couple of dates with this woman, I thought she really liked me, and then things kind of cooled off."
S08E06,ELAINE,That's it?
S08E06,EDDIE,"Well it's tough meeting somebody you like, let alone somebody Jewish."
S08E06,ELAINE,Mm. This food is fantastic.
S08E06,JERRY,Have you tried the hamentashen?
S08E06,ELAINE,I can't get off the kishkas.
S08E06,BANIA,Hey Jerry!
S08E06,JERRY,Bania?
S08E06,BANIA,I just stopped by to thank you. That risk management stuff you wrote for me? It's killer!
S08E06,JERRY,Risk management?
S08E06,BANIA,"Aw, it's gold, Jerry! Gold! I got all these corporate gigs and even Cynthia took me back."
S08E06,WOMAN,So you went from the mailroom to the director of corporate development in two days?
S08E06,EDDIE,That's right.
S08E06,WOMAN,How much are they paying you? I'll double it.
S08E06,KRAMER,Ya know these latkes are going like hotcakes.
S08E06,FRANK,Where's the powdered sugar?
S08E06,KRAMER,"You know Frank, you could take a break."
S08E06,FRANK,"No breaks. I fell reborn, I'm like a Phoenix rising from Arizona."
S08E06,ELAINE,You're quitting?
S08E06,EDDIE,I can't churn out that pointless drivel any more.
S08E06,ELAINE,"Well, you can't quit, you're all I've got. I need you!"
S08E06,VOICE,Our next speaker is George Costanza on the subject of risk management.
S08E06,GEORGE,Ovaltine. Have you ever had this stuff? Why is it called Ovaltine?
S08E06,GEORGE,They should call it round tine. You know what I'm talking about.
S08E06,WILHELM,"(proudly, to the man seated beside him) He's my protg."
S08E06,FRANK,"Noooo!!! Don't eat it! No good!"""
S08E07,JERRY,"Hey, have you seen all these new commercials for indigestion drugs? Pepcid AC, Tagemat HB."
S08E07,ELAINE,"Ugh, the whole country's sick to their stomach."
S08E07,JERRY,"Now, you know you're supposed to take these things before you get sick?"
S08E07,ELAINE,"What is this, a 'bit'?"
S08E07,JERRY,No.
S08E07,ELAINE,'Cos I'm not in the mood.
S08E07,JERRY,"We're just talking. Is this not the greatest marketing ploy ever? If you feel good, you're supposed to take one!"
S08E07,ELAINE,"Yeah, I know that tone. This is a bit."
S08E07,JERRY,They've opened up a whole new market. Medication for the well.
S08E07,ELAINE,"(tired) Alright, are you done with your little amusement?"
S08E07,JERRY,(hopeful) Then you admit it was amusing?
S08E07,ELAINE,"It was okay, but move the 'medication for the well' to the front, and hit the word 'good' harder."
S08E07,JERRY,(thinking) Great. Thanks.
S08E07,ELAINE,"So, your firm designed all the furniture in here?"
S08E07,BRETT,We manufacture it. The original designs are by Karl Farbman.
S08E07,ELAINE,"(as if she knows) Oh, Farbman."
S08E07,BRETT,You know Farbman?
S08E07,ELAINE,"Mm, love Farbman."
S08E07,BRETT,Most people go their whole lives without sitting in a Farbman.
S08E07,ELAINE,"Wuh, if you call that living. (laughs) Ahaha."
S08E07,ELAINE,Wouldn't it be great if Farbman designed shoes?
S08E07,ELAINE,Brett? Don't you think that would be great?
S08E07,ELAINE,Brett?
S08E07,BRETT,"(still staring off) After the song, babe."
S08E07,ELAINE,Huh?
S08E07,BRETT,The song.
S08E07,JERRY,So when do I meet this jerk?
S08E07,ELAINE,"He's not a jerk, Jer. He only works with Karl Farbman."
S08E07,JERRY,Who?
S08E07,ELAINE,"(dismissive) I dunno, some designer. Anyway, Brett is so generous, and sensitive. Last night he was moved just listening to a song."
S08E07,JERRY,What song?
S08E07,ELAINE,Desperado.
S08E07,JERRY,Desperado?
S08E07,ELAINE,Uh huh.
S08E07,JERRY,And you're still dating him? I tell you who sounds a little desperado.
S08E07,JERRY,"(pointing toward the guy) See that salesman, twirling that umbrella."
S08E07,ELAINE,Uh huh.
S08E07,JERRY,I invented that.
S08E07,ELAINE,"That, had to be invented?"
S08E07,JERRY,"When I started out as a comedian, I sold umbrellas. It was my idea to twirl it, to attract customers."
S08E07,ELAINE,"(skeptical) Oh hoh, really? Well, why don't we ask him about it?"
S08E07,JERRY,Elaine.
S08E07,ELAINE,"Excuse me. Hey, how you doing. Uhm, my, uh, friend here says that he invented that little twirl you're doing."
S08E07,JERRY,"Elaine, please, it was a long time ago. The man doesn't want a history lesson."
S08E07,CLICKY,Teddy Padillac came up with this twirl.
S08E07,ELAINE,(looking at Jerry) Ohh.
S08E07,JERRY,I know Teddy Padillac. I worked with him on Forty-eighth and Sixth.
S08E07,CLICKY,"Yeah, that's where he come up with it."
S08E07,JERRY,In his dreams.
S08E07,ELAINE,"Alright, can we (glances at her watch) go?"
S08E07,JERRY,"(to Clicky) By the way, you're doing it too fast. You'll disorient the customers."
S08E07,JERRY,It's the twirling that dazzles the eye.
S08E07,GEORGE,(pulls a face) I find it disorienting. Who buys an umbrella anyway? Y..you get 'em for free in the coffee shop in the metal cans.
S08E07,JERRY,(as if speaking to a moron) Those belong to people.
S08E07,KRAMER,Hey. Well. (proffers the envelope) This was downstairs for you. Ker-ching.
S08E07,JERRY,"(taking the envelope) Oh no, not more checks. They're coming faster than I can sign 'em."
S08E07,GEORGE,What checks?
S08E07,KRAMER,"Oh, you didn't hear? Jerry's a big star in Japan."
S08E07,JERRY,I don't know why. There's a one-second clip of me in the opening credits of some Japanese comedy show.
S08E07,KRAMER,"Yeah, the Super Terrific Happy Hour."
S08E07,JERRY,"(opening the envelope and pulling out a stack of checks) They run it all the time, and now I'm starting to get all these royalty checks."
S08E07,GEORGE,Look at all of those! You're rich!
S08E07,JERRY,Naw. Each one is for like twelve cents. It's barely worth the pain in my hand to sign 'em.
S08E07,KRAMER,"Hey, Jerry, you need any new furniture?"
S08E07,JERRY,Why?
S08E07,KRAMER,"(getting a bottle of water out of the fridge) Yeah, well, Elaine's new boyfriend, you know. He's giving me this oversize chest of drawers. It's a Farbman."
S08E07,GEORGE,He's giving you furniture? Who is this guy?
S08E07,JERRY,"Ah, who are any of her losers?"
S08E07,GEORGE,(dryly) You're on that list.
S08E07,GEORGE,"Alright, I gotta go home and open up with the house for the carpet cleaners. You know they're doing my whole place for twenty-five dollars."
S08E07,KRAMER,"Oh, no, no, no. Not the Sunshine Carpet Cleaners?"
S08E07,EGO,"Yeah, you heard of 'em?"
S08E07,KRAMER,They're a crazy religious cult. The carpet cleaning is just a means for them to get into your apartment.
S08E07,GEORGE,"So? For a twenty-five dollar cleaning, I can listen to some pointless blather."
S08E07,JERRY,"I do it, I'm not even getting the cleaning."
S08E07,JERRY,Signed over a hundred checks this morning.
S08E07,KRAMER,"Hello, twelve dollars."
S08E07,MR OH,Excuse me. Would you take picture please?
S08E07,KRAMER,"(takes camera) Oh, yeah, sure."
S08E07,JERRY,I'm gonna ask this guy something.
S08E07,JERRY,"(to umbrella guy) Hey. Nice twirl you got there. You know who invented that, don't you?"
S08E07,KRAMER,"(to tourists) Hey, are you folks from Japan."
S08E07,MR YAMAGUCHI,Hai.
S08E07,MR OH,Yes.
S08E07,KRAMER,(points over to Jerry) You recognise that mug?
S08E07,KRAMER,That's the funny face that greets you at the beginning of the Super Terrific Happy Hour.
S08E07,MR OH,"Ahh, Super Terrific Happy..."
S08E07,KRAMER,"Ah, yeah. Yeah, that's him."
S08E07,MR OH,What is he doing?
S08E07,KRAMER,"Well, I don't know. But something super terrific, I'm sure."
S08E07,MR OH,He's funny.
S08E07,KRAMER,"Oh yeah, very funny. And it wouldn't be impolite to laugh at his antics."
S08E07,KRAMER,"Yeah. Yeah, that's it. Because everybody laughs at Jerry here in America."
S08E07,CREW LEADER,(calling to George) We're pretty much finished.
S08E07,CREW LEADER,There's just one more thing.
S08E07,GEORGE,(smiling expectantly) Here it comes.
S08E07,CREW LEADER,(clears throat) You forgot to sign your check.
S08E07,GEORGE,"(signs) Sorry. (expectant) You're sure, uh, there isn't anything else?"
S08E07,CREW LEADER,(flat) No.
S08E07,GEORGE,"(let down) So, that's it?"
S08E07,CREW LEADER,Unless you need a receipt.
S08E07,GEORGE,"(melancholy) I wish that was all needed. Life can be so confusing. I..I'm searching for answers, anywhere."
S08E07,CREW LEADER,(flat) Good luck with that.
S08E07,JERRY,Hey.
S08E07,ELAINE,What's with the claw?
S08E07,JERRY,Super terrific carpal tunnel syndrome.
S08E07,BRETT,(to Elaine) There's no sign of Kramer.
S08E07,ELAINE,"Oh, Brett. (indicating) This is Jerry."
S08E07,JERRY,Hi.
S08E07,BRETT,That's very funny. Elaine told me you were some kinda comedian.
S08E07,JERRY,"Ah, I'm one kind."
S08E07,ELAINE,Have you seen the chest of drawers that Brett gave to Kramer?
S08E07,JERRY,The Fleckman.
S08E07,BRETT,Farbman.
S08E07,JERRY,Right.
S08E07,ELAINE,You gotta see 'em. Beautiful.
S08E07,JERRY,"(not interested) Oh, I'm sure they are."
S08E07,BRETT,I'd be happy to get you some if that's what you're driving at.
S08E07,JERRY,"No. I'm fine, thank you."
S08E07,BRETT,Don't worry. It's no charge to you.
S08E07,BRETT,Looks like what you really need is a decent desk for writing your skits.
S08E07,JERRY,(quiet annoyance) I don't write skits.
S08E07,BRETT,"(walking back to Elaine) Well, of course you don't. You don't have a proper workstation. I'll fax you over my catalogue."
S08E07,ELAINE,"Mmm. Brett, uhm, Jerry doesn't have a fax machine."
S08E07,BRETT,(quiet) Oops.
S08E07,BRETT,"Well, I'm sure things'll pick up for you soon. Elaine, maybe we should get going."
S08E07,ELAINE,"Oh. Jerry, you wanna join us?"
S08E07,JERRY,"Oh, where you going? The coffee shop?"
S08E07,BRETT,(scoff) Coffee shop? I think we can do a little better than that. You look like you could use a solid meal at a real restaurant.
S08E07,JERRY,You look like you could use a...
S08E07,ELAINE,(warning) Jerry.
S08E07,KRAMER,"(reads) Three hundred dollars. Hey, Mr Oh, how much would these run you in Tokyo?"
S08E07,MR OH,"(thinks for a second) Ahh, about, uh, thirty thousand yen."
S08E07,KRAMER,(shocked) Thirty thousand?! These are practically free.
S08E07,KRAMER,Giddyup. You're a cowboy now.
S08E07,BRETT,"I feel terrible about your friend Jerry. He's upset that I gave Kramer that chest of drawers, isn't he?"
S08E07,ELAINE,Why? Why d'you think he's upset?
S08E07,BRETT,"How could he not be? Living in that cramped little apartment. And outdated furniture, so terribly... un-Karl Farbman-like."
S08E07,ELAINE,"(romantic) We're not gonna talk about Karl Farbman all night, are we?"
S08E07,BRETT,(smiling) I hope not.
S08E07,ELAINE,(surprised) Brett? Everything alright?
S08E07,ELAINE,(worried) Brett! What is it? Is there someone outside?
S08E07,BRETT,"Elaine, the song."
S08E07,ELAINE,"(relieved) Oh. Oh, oh, phew. You know, for a minute there I thought it was like that urban legend about the guy with the hook who's hanging on the fender..."
S08E07,BRETT,"Elaine, could you just not talk for one minute?"
S08E07,ELAINE,"(apologetic, silently mouthed) Sorry."
S08E07,JERRY,No spiel?
S08E07,GEORGE,(annoyed) Not a peep. They just cleaned the carpets and left. Call themselves a cult!
S08E07,JERRY,So you're angry that this bizarre carpet cabal made no attempt to abduct you?
S08E07,GEORGE,They could've at least tried!
S08E07,JERRY,"You know, maybe they thought you looked too smart to be brainwashed?"
S08E07,GEORGE,Please.
S08E07,JERRY,Too dumb?
S08E07,JERRY,(impressed) Well! Mack is back in town! Nice duds.
S08E07,KRAMER,"Konichi-wa. Yeah, it's a gift from my Japanese friends. (sits beside Jerry) They're known as gift-givers. And tonight we're going dancing at the Rainbow Room."
S08E07,JERRY,Sounds like you're throwing a lot of their money around.
S08E07,KRAMER,"Well, Jerry, they're Japanese. I mean, that TV you watch, that sushi you eat, I mean, even that kimono you wear. Where to you think all that money goes, hmm?"
S08E07,KRAMER,That's right.
S08E07,GEORGE,How'd you hook up with these guys?
S08E07,KRAMER,"Well, they recognised Jerry from the Super Terrific Happy Hour. See now, you should be doing your own show in Japan. Now, they get you."
S08E07,JERRY,What kind of show am I gonna do in Japan?
S08E07,KRAMER,"(to George) Alright, what'd you do with that pilot you did."
S08E07,GEORGE,"(excited) Yeah, the pilot!"
S08E07,KRAMER,"That's right, I think that had marvellous production values."
S08E07,GEORGE,"(enthusiastic) And, you know, I do a lotta business with Japanese TV. They broadcast a lot of American baseball. They got an office here in New York!"
S08E07,JERRY,Forget it! The pilot was awful. It failed.
S08E07,GEORGE,"(animated) It failed here! Because, here, every time you turn on a TV, all you see is four morons sitting round an apartment, whining about their dates!"
S08E07,KRAMER,"George is right, Jerry. See, here, you're just another apple, but in Japan, you're an exotic fruit. Like an orange. Which is rare there."
S08E07,TV JERRY,You had a date? You went out with my butler?! Who said you could go out with my butler?!
S08E07,TV ELAINE,"Well, why do I need your permission?"
S08E07,TV JERRY,Because he's my butler.
S08E07,GEORGE,(eager) So? What d'you think?
S08E07,EXECUTIVE 1,We're bit confused. Why was this man Jerry's butler?
S08E07,GEORGE,"Ah. You see, the man who was the butler, uh, had gotten into a car accident with Jerry, and because he didn't have any insurance, the judge decreed that the man become Jerry's butler."
S08E07,EXECUTIVE 1,Is this customary in your legal system?
S08E07,JERRY,No. That's what makes it such a humorous situation.
S08E07,EXECUTIVE 1,(speaks Japanese) SUBTITLE Are you following any of this?
S08E07,EXECUTIVE 2,(speaks Japanese) SUBTITLE I'm still trying to figure out why they gave us a bag of oranges.
S08E07,EXECUTIVE 1,"(to Jerry and George) I'm sorry. I'm sure Mr Seinfeld is very funny to Americans, but I'm not sure this butler show would work in Japan."
S08E07,GEORGE,"Oh, I, uh, I disagree. You've, uh, you've been living in America too long. (indicates the bag of oranges) You've forgotten what it's like to have no oranges."
S08E07,EXECUTIVE 1,(speaks Japanese) SUBTITLE Again with the oranges
S08E07,JERRY,(flexing his fingers) Sorry. My hand is numb.
S08E07,GEORGE,(positive) Yes. From endorsing checks for the Super Terrific Happy Hour. (laughs)
S08E07,EXECUTIVE 1,You must go now.
S08E07,ELAINE,"Ah, I think I'm on the outs with Brett. I got shushed during Desperado."
S08E07,JERRY,(throws out his hands) What does he listen to? The all Desperado station?
S08E07,ELAINE,"He is just in his own world when he hears that song. It's like, I'm sitting there in the car, and he's.. out riding fences."
S08E07,JERRY,"You know, what you need is a song you can share."
S08E07,ELAINE,Yes. You're right. We need to find 'our' song.
S08E07,JERRY,"Okay. So, is there any song that you feel very strongly about?"
S08E07,ELAINE,(points) I like Witchy Woman.
S08E07,JERRY,Witchy Woman?
S08E07,ELAINE,"You know, Witchy Woman. (sings) 'Ooo-ooh, wit-chay woman'."
S08E07,JERRY,(getting it) Ahh. Wit-chay Woman.
S08E07,KRAMER,"(to Jerry) Hey, man."
S08E07,ELAINE,Hey.
S08E07,JERRY,Hey. How was the Rainbow Room?
S08E07,KRAMER,"Uh, well, we, uh, we had to leave early. There was a, uh, slight monetary discrepancy regarding the bill."
S08E07,JERRY,Ah.
S08E07,KRAMER,"Uh, listen, uh, can I borrow some pillows?"
S08E07,JERRY,What for?
S08E07,KRAMER (O.C.),"Yeah, well, uh, my Japanese friends're gonna stay with me."
S08E07,JERRY,I thought they all had suites at the Plaza?
S08E07,KRAMER,"Well, I'm sorry, Jerry, we all don't have checks rolling in like you do."
S08E07,JERRY,"Well, what about all that money from the kimonos I wear?"
S08E07,KRAMER,"Well, they ran out of it. Manhattan can be quite pricey. Even with fifty thousand yen."
S08E07,ELAINE,Fifty thousand yen? Isn't that only a few hundred dollars?
S08E07,KRAMER,"Evidently. (To Elaine) Oh, by the way, tell Brett that his chest of drawers are a big hit. My guests are very comfortable in them."
S08E07,ELAINE,In them?!
S08E07,JERRY,You have them sleeping in drawers?!
S08E07,KRAMER,"Jerry, have you ever seen the business hotels in Tokyo? They sleep in tiny stacked cubicles all the time. They feel right at home."
S08E07,JERRY,This has 'international incident' written all over it.
S08E07,KRAMER,"(smiling) Oh yeah, yeah."
S08E07,KRAMER,"Goodnight, Mr Tanaka."
S08E07,MR TANAKA,Goodnight.
S08E07,KRAMER,"Goodnight, Mr Oh."
S08E07,MR OH,(sits up) Goodnight.
S08E07,KRAMER,"Goodnight, Mr Yamaguchi."
S08E07,MR YAMAGUCHI,(sits up) Oyasuminasai *(Japanese for goodnight)
S08E07,JERRY,What is this?
S08E07,KRAMER,"Rice Crispies. East meets West, Jerry."
S08E07,JERRY,"Ah. It's a lovely little bureau and breakfast you're running. Well, I'm off to the bank."
S08E07,KRAMER,(opening the fridge) Sayonara.
S08E07,JERRY,(leaving) Konichi-wa.
S08E07,BRETT,"Elaine, I..."
S08E07,ELAINE,Shh-shh! (smiling) What d'you think?
S08E07,ELAINE,What are you doing? That's Witchy Woman. That could be our song.
S08E07,BRETT,"Witchy Woman is okay for you, but I've already got a song."
S08E07,ELAINE,"Oh. Oh, then how about Desperado? (smiling) We can share it."
S08E07,BRETT,(flat) No. It's mine.
S08E07,KRAMER,"Here you go. Snap, crackle and pop."
S08E07,KRAMER,"(loudly) Good morning, Mr Oh. I gotta make up the drawer."
S08E07,MR OH (O.C.),"Ach, come back in half hour."
S08E07,JERRY,"(calls) Hey, I'll take one."
S08E07,CLICKY,"Well, look who's back!"
S08E07,CLICKY,Teddy! (indicates Jerry) This's the guy says he invented the twirl.
S08E07,TEDDY,(unfriendly recognition) Jerry Seinfeld!
S08E07,JERRY,"Teddy Padillac. Long time, no see. (pointing at the umbrellas) What've you got in a push-button mini."
S08E07,TEDDY,"(bitter) Same thing we had, when you bailed on us, fifteen years ago."
S08E07,JERRY,"Bailed? C'mon, you knew I wanted to be a comedian. Besides, we had some good time. Remember Tropical Storm Renee?"
S08E07,TEDDY,"(angry) Oh, yeah, sure. But where were you during the poncho craze of eighty-four? I almost lost my house."
S08E07,CLICKY,"Umbrella, buddy?"
S08E07,CLICKY,Now we got that damn 'urban sombrero' to contend with.
S08E07,TEDDY,"(to Clicky) Easy, there. (to Jerry) I hear you're taking credit for the twirl."
S08E07,JERRY,"Aw, it was so many years ago. Who cares?"
S08E07,TEDDY,(intense) I care. Clicky cares.
S08E07,JERRY,"So, could I..."
S08E07,JERRY,Could I just buy an umbrella?
S08E07,TEDDY,"(sour) Yeah, sure. Two hundred dollars."
S08E07,JERRY,(shock) What?!
S08E07,TEDDY,"(caustically) Special price, for a real foul-weather friend."
S08E07,KRAMER,"Hey, George. How about that tour, huh? These guys are ready to run the bases."
S08E07,GEORGE,"(indicating the window) Kramer, it's, it's raining. They got the tarp on the field."
S08E07,KRAMER,"(quietly) Ah, listen, George, what else can I do with these guys? Now, bear in mind, they're a little light on the yen."
S08E07,GEORGE,"Well, I, I got the pilot of the Jerry show."
S08E07,KRAMER,"(snaps his fingers) That's perfect. (to the Japanese) Hey, how would you guys like to watch Super Terrific Happy star Jerry Seinfeld?"
S08E07,MR OH,"But, we are also very hungry."
S08E07,KRAMER,"Oh, yeah, yeah. (feeds tape into VCR) Well, you guys just watch the tape and, uh, I'll get you some food."
S08E07,KRAMER,"(shouts) Hey, peanuts!"
S08E07,WILHELM,George. (waves George over) George.
S08E07,WILHELM,"(puzzled) Uh, George, uh, did you call some carpet cleaners?"
S08E07,GEORGE,Are they here?
S08E07,WILHELM,"They're in my office, right now."
S08E07,GEORGE,"(suspicious) They haven't said anything to you, have they?"
S08E07,WILHELM,About what?
S08E07,GEORGE,"(to himself, resentful) What kind of a snobby, stuck-up, cult is this?!"
S08E07,BRETT,(calls over) Hey Jerry!
S08E07,JERRY,"Oh, hi Brett."
S08E07,BRETT,Haven't you ever heard of an umbrella?
S08E07,JERRY,"Ah, I didn't have enough money."
S08E07,BRETT,I'm sure things'll pick up for you.
S08E07,JERRY,"No, it's not that, it's the..."
S08E07,JERRY,"Oh no, look at the checks! Hours of hard work ruined!"
S08E07,BRETT,"Ah, don't worry, I can spot you the (reads) twelve cents?"
S08E07,JERRY,"No, it's not the money. It's my hand. It's crippled from writing and writing."
S08E07,BRETT,"Nothing's working for you, is is?"
S08E07,JERRY,"(bitter) Not at the moment, Brett."
S08E07,BRETT,"I'd give you a ride, but I got Karl Farbman here."
S08E07,JERRY,(sarcastic) Thanks for stopping!
S08E07,ELAINE,"Brett said you ran away from him, as if he were the boogetyman."
S08E07,JERRY,Boogeyman.
S08E07,ELAINE,Boogey?
S08E07,JERRY,"I'm quite sure. Anyway, any luck getting together on a song?"
S08E07,ELAINE,"No. He blew out my Witchy Woman, and he won't share Desperado. Hey, what d'you think of Oye Como Va?"
S08E07,JERRY,(negative) Eehh.
S08E07,ELAINE,"(desperation) Well, I'm running outta guys here in this city, Jer!"
S08E07,JERRY,Hey.
S08E07,GEORGE,(excited) Great news! I showed the pilot to Kramer's Japanese friends. They loved it!
S08E07,JERRY,Really? They bought the butler character?
S08E07,GEORGE,(excited) Did I tell you that story's relatable?! That was a great show! That is why I'm bringing it back to NBC.
S08E07,JERRY,NBC?
S08E07,GEORGE,(little subdued) Nakahama Broadcast Corporation.
S08E07,JERRY,Ah. But they told us we must go now.
S08E07,GEORGE,"But now I have my own market research. Actual Japanese viewers, that love the show! I'm gonna talk to Kramer."
S08E07,JERRY,"Hey, George, do me a favour. If they make you an offer, whatever it is. (vehement) Just take it!"
S08E07,GEORGE,"Hey, by the way, what'd you think of Miss Yoshimura?"
S08E07,JERRY,Who?
S08E07,GEORGE,The network executive. You think she liked me?
S08E07,KRAMER,Heyy! Look who's here.
S08E07,KRAMER,"(beckoning to George) Come on, I want you to come in here."
S08E07,MR OH,"Come on in, fat boy!"
S08E07,GEORGE,"Get a good night's sleep, alright fellas. (thumbs up) Big day tomorrow!"
S08E07,JERRY,(to himself) Last one.
S08E07,JERRY,(agonised) Uugh! Ahh.
S08E07,KRAMER,There you are.
S08E07,GEORGE,Uh. (smiles) Where's the boys?
S08E07,KRAMER,"Uh, no, I let 'em sleep in."
S08E07,KRAMER,I'm on my way to cash in their plane tickets for them. They need a little food money.
S08E07,GEORGE,(horrified) But that meeting starts in ten minutes!
S08E07,KRAMER,"No, well, I set their alarm. But they did have a lot of sake in that hot-tub."
S08E07,GEORGE,(frantic) I'm calling Jerry.
S08E07,JERRY,Yeah?
S08E07,GEORGE,"(panicked and rushed) Jerry! The Japanese guys had sake in the hot-tub! You gotta get 'em outta the drawers and get 'em down here, or I don't have a focus group to sell the pilot to Japanese TV!"
S08E07,JERRY,(kidding) Uncle Leo?
S08E07,GEORGE,(scream) Jerry!!
S08E07,JERRY,"Alright, alright. I'll wake 'em up."
S08E07,JERRY,"(to himself) Hmm, testy."
S08E07,JERRY,Hello?
S08E07,MR OH (O.C.),"Mr Jerry! Open the drawer, please!"
S08E07,JERRY,It's stuck. (pained) Oww! The steam from the hot-tub musta warped the wood.
S08E07,MR OH (O.C.),Pull harder.
S08E07,JERRY,I'm trying. I can't get a grip. My hand's had kind of a bad week.
S08E07,MR OH (O.C),"Very funny, but no joking, please."
S08E07,JERRY,"(looks round) Don't worry, I'll get you out."
S08E07,ELAINE,"Brett, believe me. You don't have to do this."
S08E07,BRETT,"Elaine, I know he'll appreciate this. Granted, it's not as nice as Kramer's cabinet, but it's start."
S08E07,ELAINE,"Uh, I promise you, Jerry is not jealous of Kramer's cabinet."
S08E07,JERRY (O.C.),(yell) Move to the back of the drawers!
S08E07,ELAINE,Jerry?
S08E07,ELAINE,Jerry.
S08E07,BRETT,(shouting) Not the Farbman!!
S08E07,MR OH,(speaks Japanese) SUBTITLE Jerry Seinfeld is a dangerous lunatic. He wouldn't let us out of the drawers. Then he came at me with an axe.
S08E07,EXECUTIVE 1,(speaks Japanese) SUBTITLE We suspect his friend here is also unbalanced.
S08E07,GEORGE,"So, uh, gentlemen, do we have a deal?"
S08E07,MR OH,(speaks Japanese) SUBTITLE Could we have a couple of those oranges?
S08E07,MR OH,(speaks Japanese) SUBTITLE We are very hungry and have survived many hardships.
S08E07,GEORGE,(to the executives) Excuse me. Did you hire the Sunshine Carpet Cleaners?
S08E07,EXECUTIVE 1,"Yes. Cleaned up the (points) coffee stain, left by Jerry Seinfield."
S08E07,GEORGE,Mr Wilhelm? Wha..what're you doing here?
S08E07,WILHELM,"I'm here to clean the carpets. Most of the world is carpeted. And, one day, we will do the cleaning."
S08E07,GEORGE,(incredulity) Him you brainwashed! (angry shout) What's he got that I don't have?!
S08E07,GEORGE,"(urgent) Mr Wilhelm, listen. You've been abducted! Please, Mr Wilhelm, you gotta listen to me!"
S08E07,WILHELM,Wilhelm? (he raises the nozzle of his cleaner) My name is Tanya.
S08E07,EXECUTIVE 1,(speaks Japanese) SUBTITLE With these two idiots I don't know how the Yankees won the World Series.
S08E07,JERRY,"(apologetically) Brett, I'm, I'm really sorry. I didn't mean to hit you in the head with.. an axe."
S08E07,JERRY,(defensive) At least it was just the handle!
S08E07,BRETT,It was a beautiful cabinet. What am I gonna tell...
S08E07,BRETT,I can't remember his name!
S08E07,JERRY,Fleckman?
S08E07,ELAINE,"Calm down Brett, okay. You could have a concussion. Calm down. (holds Brett's head and sings) 'Desperado, mmm-mm-mmm. You better...'"
S08E07,ELAINE/JERRY,"(singing) '...let somebody love you. Let somebody love you, before it's too...'"
S08E07,NURSE,His pulse is fine.
S08E07,DOCTOR,Hmm. Looks like a minor concussion. Let me see what I can do to relieve the swelling.
S08E07,NURSE,Doctor?
S08E07,NURSE,(concerned) Doctor?
S08E07,NURSE,(worried) Doctor?
S08E07,NURSE,"(alarm) Doctor, I think we're losing him!"
S08E08,GEORGE,Dollar Eighty-Nine. Why is this a dollar eighty-nine? Why is there no haggling in this country?
S08E08,JERRY,I guess we like to think we've progressed beyond a knife fight for a citrus drink.
S08E08,GEORGE,Not me. Everything should be negotiable. (he picks up a container of fruit)
S08E08,JERRY,Restaurants too?
S08E08,GEORGE,Absolutely. You're telling me there's no room to move on pasta. All starches are a scam.
S08E08,JERRY,"Yea especially Ziti, with that big hole."
S08E08,GEORGE,"Ahh, Excuse me, how much is this?"
S08E08,WORKER,Dollar nineteen.
S08E08,GEORGE,I'll give you a quarter.
S08E08,WORKER,Get the hell out of here.
S08E08,JERRY,Tell him forty and no fork.
S08E08,GEORGE,Thirty.
S08E08,WORKER,That's it you leave and never come back!
S08E08,JERRY,"How about we leave and, come back in a week?"
S08E08,WORKER,Deal! (turns and walks into the market)
S08E08,GEORGE,Alright see? We got something there.
S08E08,KRAMER,Awe check it out.
S08E08,JERRY,"Wow. Kenny Rogers Roasters. Finally open. Hey, look at the size of that neon chicken on the roof."
S08E08,KRAMER,"Roger's can't sell chicken around here, we got chicken places on every block."
S08E08,JERRY,He is the gambler.
S08E08,KRAMER,"Well, (rubs hands) I gotta meet Newman at the pet store. Helping him pick out a turtle."
S08E08,JERRY,Try and stay calm.
S08E08,KRAMER,"Yea, yea."
S08E08,MAN,Hey Jerry.
S08E08,JERRY,Seth! Wow what has it been like five years?
S08E08,SETH,At least.
S08E08,JERRY,You wanna grab lunch?
S08E08,SETH,"Ah, I'm actually headed back to the office."
S08E08,JERRY,"Seth, it's me. What's more important than catching up with an old college buddy?"
S08E08,SETH,"Well I am, supposed to be in this meeting."
S08E08,JERRY,Blow it off. Remember Poli Sci? How many of those did we go to?
S08E08,SETH & JERRY,"Alright, alright."
S08E08,JERRY,Hey whatever happened to Moochie?
S08E08,SETH,He's dead.
S08E08,JERRY,Is that right?
S08E08,GEORGE,You know I still don't know how you can call lunch with me a business expense.
S08E08,ELAINE,What do you think of the catalog?
S08E08,GEORGE,It stinks.
S08E08,ELAINE,"There, we just talked business."
S08E08,SALES WOMAN,We do have the down comforter and the cookware you liked.
S08E08,ELAINE,"Oh great, put it all on the Peterman account with the other stuff."
S08E08,SALES WOMAN,You know what else we have that you might like?
S08E08,ELAINE,I'll take it.
S08E08,GEORGE,"Hey, you like?"
S08E08,SALES WOMAN,I think it looks very nice on you.
S08E08,GEORGE,Really? (feeling flattered)
S08E08,SALES WOMAN,Hmm.
S08E08,GEORGE,"Elaine, huh... Peterman account?"
S08E08,ELAINE,Why not? (To the Sales Woman) And some hair for my little friend here.
S08E08,SETH,So how's your stand up career?
S08E08,JERRY,"Good, as a matter of fact. I almost had my own show in Japan."
S08E08,SETH,Do you speak Japanese?
S08E08,JERRY,No
S08E08,SETH,"So you would have done it in Japan, but in English."
S08E08,JERRY,I don't know. So what's this job of yours?
S08E08,SETH,Big investment firm.
S08E08,JERRY,Mmmm.
S08E08,SETH,We just got the Citibank account. In fact today was our first big meeting with them.
S08E08,JERRY,"The, the meeting you blew off?"
S08E08,SETH,Yea.
S08E08,JERRY,Wasn't that kind of important?
S08E08,SETH,Yea.
S08E08,ELAINE,"...and I brought I whole new set of cookware, and a Water Pik."
S08E08,JERRY,You use a Water Pik?
S08E08,ELAINE,"Sure. Water Pik, floss, Plax, brush, Listerine."
S08E08,JERRY,"So you go in the bathroom at eleven your in bed by what, two?"
S08E08,ELAINE,"Well, at the latest. Oh hang on a second, I gotta another call."
S08E08,ELAINE,Hello?
S08E08,MAN,Good day Ms. Benes. Its Roger Ipswitch.
S08E08,ELAINE,Oh hey! How things doing in accounting?
S08E08,ROGER,"Ms. Benes, I notice youve been charging quite a bit of merchandise on the Peterman account."
S08E08,ELAINE,"Well, I am the President."
S08E08,ROGER,"Yes, and we're all very impressed. Never the less, the expense account is for business purposes only."
S08E08,ELAINE,"Well, well isn't the president allowed to do anything that they want?"
S08E08,ROGER,No. I'll be in your office first thing tomorrow. Good day. (hangs up the phone)
S08E08,ELAINE,Good day.
S08E08,JERRY,Hello. Anybody?
S08E08,GEORGE,Hey.
S08E08,JERRY,Hey. Why didn't cha get the big one?
S08E08,GEORGE,"This hat just bottles in the heat, I -I don't even need a coat! It's unbelievable!"
S08E08,JERRY,I don't believe it.
S08E08,GEORGE,"Ah, and I got a date with the sales woman. She's got a little Marisa Tomei thing going on."
S08E08,JERRY,"Ahh, too bad you got a little, George Costanza thing going on."
S08E08,GEORGE,"I'm going out with her tomorrow, she said she had some errands to run."
S08E08,JERRY,That's a date?
S08E08,GEORGE,"What's the difference? You know they way I work. I'm like a commercial jingle. First it's a little irritating, then you hear it a few times, youre hummin it in the shower, by the third date it's (sings) ""By Mennen!""."
S08E08,JERRY,How do you make sure your gonna get to the third date?
S08E08,GEORGE,"If there's any doubt, I do a leave-behind. Keys, gloves, scarf -- I go back to her place to pick it up...(pop sound) date number two."
S08E08,JERRY,That is so old. Why don't you show up at her door in a wood horse?
S08E08,JERRY,"(sings theme) ""By Mennen.""  What the?..."
S08E08,JERRY,What's going on in there?
S08E08,KRAMER,What?
S08E08,JERRY,That light!
S08E08,KRAMER,"Oh the red. Yeah, Its the chicken roaster sign. You know, its right across from my window."
S08E08,JERRY,Can't you shut the shades?
S08E08,KRAMER,"They are shut. Oh by the way, your friend Seth, he stopped by."
S08E08,JERRY,Oh yeah? What'd he have to say?
S08E08,KRAMER,"Yeah, he was fired."
S08E08,ELAINE,"Well, as you can see the comforter I expensed is actually the Aristotle goose down tunic. (laughs, modeling the comforter) What do you think?"
S08E08,ROGER,Another bulls eye.
S08E08,ELAINE,Hmm. Well Mr. Ipswitch since everyone of my expenses was obviously for a legitimate business purpose.
S08E08,ROGER,I just need to see the sable hat you purchased yesterday.
S08E08,ELAINE,The hat? Why do you need to see the hat?
S08E08,ROGER,It costs eight-thousand dollars.
S08E08,ELAINE,What?
S08E08,ELAINE,Ohh. (trying to control the Water Pik and shut it off.)
S08E08,JERRY,"Seth, if you knew the meeting was so important why did you go the lunch with me?"
S08E08,SETH,We're old college buddies.
S08E08,JERRY,I only knew you through Moochie.
S08E08,SETH,"Hey Jerry don't worry about it all right. The important thing is, is we got to catch up. Mind if I ah, grab the want ads?"
S08E08,JERRY,"Um, actually I haven't read Tank McNamara yet. (takes the paper back)"
S08E08,JERRY,How's life on the red planet? (shuts door)
S08E08,KRAMER,"Its killing me, I can't eat, I can't sleep. All I can see is that giant red sun in the shape of a chicken. (gets some cereal from the cubard and pours it in a big bowl)"
S08E08,JERRY,"Well, did you go down to the Kenny Rogers and complain?"
S08E08,KRAMER,"Ah, they gave me the heave ho. You know, I don't think that Kenny Rogers has any idea what's going on down there."
S08E08,JERRY,What are you doing?
S08E08,KRAMER,Getting some cereal
S08E08,JERRY,"That, that's tomato juice."
S08E08,KRAMER,"That looked like milk to me! Jerry my Rods and Cones are all screwed up! Alright, that's it.  I gotta move in with you Jerry."
S08E08,JERRY,"I don't know Kramer, ahh, my concern is that ...."
S08E08,JERRY,..living together after a while we... we might start to get on each others nerves a little.
S08E08,KRAMER,"Alright listen to me, I got a great idea. Now, you're a heavy sleeper, right? Why don't we just switch apartments?"
S08E08,JERRY,"Or I could sleep in the park? You could knock these walls down, make it an eight room luxury suite."
S08E08,KRAMER,"Jerry these are load bearing walls, they're not gonna come down!"
S08E08,JERRY,"Yea, that's no good."
S08E08,KRAMER,I may have to drive that place out of business.
S08E08,JERRY,How you gonna do that?
S08E08,KRAMER,"Like we did in the sixties, takin' in to the streets."
S08E08,HEATHER,"Thanks George, but I got it from here."
S08E08,GEORGE,Oh no I'm in already come on.
S08E08,GEORGE,"So eh, you eh, wanna get together tomorrow?"
S08E08,HEATHER,"No, I'm gonna be pretty busy."
S08E08,GEORGE,What about this weekend?
S08E08,HEATHER,I'm gonna be busy for a while.
S08E08,GEORGE,"OK, ah.. (George throws his keys on the table) see ya!"
S08E08,HEATHER,"Hey, you forgot your keys."
S08E08,GEORGE,"Oh, those, those aren't my keys."
S08E08,HEATHER,Well they're not mine.
S08E08,GEORGE,"Oh. Ha. They are my keys, how weird. (laughs)"
S08E08,HEATHER,Goodbye George.
S08E08,GEORGE,Yea bye.
S08E08,HEATHER,"George, Bye! (picks up phone) Hello? You are not going to believe the date I just had."
S08E08,GEORGE,"(sings) Co-stan-za. (like ""By Mennen"")"
S08E08,ELAINE,What do you mean you don't have the hat?
S08E08,GEORGE,I left it at Heather's. Are these alive? (pounding on glass display)
S08E08,ELAINE,"No dead! George, I need that Russian hat back!"
S08E08,GEORGE,"Alright, alright, I'll call Heather, you'll get your hat back, I will get a second date. Ha ha ha. Now watch the magic."
S08E08,ELAINE,Dial 9- MERLIN.
S08E08,HEATHER,Hello?
S08E08,GEORGE,"(clears throat) Heather Hi, it's George Costanza."
S08E08,HEATHER,Oy!
S08E08,GEORGE,"Ah, listen ah, I don't mean to bother you but ah, silly me, I- I think I may have left my hat in your apartment. So ah, I thought I'd just come by later and pick it up."
S08E08,HEATHER,You didn't' leave a hat here.
S08E08,GEORGE,"I- I'm pretty sure I left it eh, behind the cushion of the chair ... accidentally."
S08E08,HEATHER,No hat. George I gotta go.
S08E08,GEORGE,"Ah, a, You know what, maybe I'll just come ... umm, yummm (stammering)"
S08E08,JERRY,Seth?
S08E08,SETH,Jerry Hi! What do you think?
S08E08,JERRY,"I think your taking the trash out for this chicken place, but that couldn't be."
S08E08,SETH,"Yeah, I'm the new manager"
S08E08,JERRY,"But your were an executive, this is fast food."
S08E08,SETH,"Not fast food, good food quickly. Hey, next time lunchll be on me, huh Jer."
S08E08,KRAMER,"Hey, stay away from the chicken. Bad, bad chicken, mess you up."
S08E08,SETH,That's not going to be good for business.
S08E08,JERRY,That's not going to be good for anybody.
S08E08,KRAMER,Jerry Im so glad we switched apartments. It was a perfect solution.
S08E08,JERRY,"Look Kramer, i-i-if I'm gonna live over there, y-y-you gotta take some of this stuff out. I mean this thing is really freaking me out (holds up a ventriloquist dummy). I feel like its gonna come to life in the middle of the night and kill me."
S08E08,KRAMER,"What, Mr. Marbles? He's harmless."
S08E08,JERRY,"And one other thing, I don't want Newman using my..."
S08E08,JERRY,Oh no.
S08E08,NEWMAN,Nice place you got here Kramer ...
S08E08,KRAMER,Yeah.
S08E08,NEWMAN,"... a man can really get some thinking done. (sits on couch, next to Kramer.)"
S08E08,JERRY,Well don't get too comfortable. As soon as Seth gets a real job you two are gong back in that chicken supernova.
S08E08,KRAMER,What is that Roger's Chicken? Oh get that outta here.
S08E08,NEWMAN,I don't know. The man makes a pretty strong bird.
S08E08,KRAMER,Well I'm boycotting it.
S08E08,NEWMAN,(eating) hm.
S08E08,KRAMER,"What is that, hickory?"
S08E08,NEWMAN,"Yea, it's the wood that makes it good."
S08E08,KRAMER,Really?
S08E08,NEWMAN,Uh-Huh.
S08E08,KRAMER,Oh stop it. (he slaps Newmans shoulder) Whats the matter with you.
S08E08,KRAMER,Mmmmm.
S08E08,HEATHER,Can I help you?
S08E08,ELAINE,"Hi, yeah, I'm Elaine Benes, we met at Barney's..."
S08E08,HEATHER,Oh.
S08E08,ELAINE,"... I'm a friend of George Costanza's. (while she is talking, she is dragging George in by pulling his ear)"
S08E08,GEORGE,Hi.
S08E08,ELAINE,"Ah, (releases Georges ear) whether you're aware of it or not George had this pathetic little plan to, leave something behind so he could weasel a second date."
S08E08,HEATHER,Really?
S08E08,ELAINE,"I know, he- he has a real confidence problem."
S08E08,GEORGE,Well not really...
S08E08,ELAINE,George...
S08E08,GEORGE,Ah... (quietly)
S08E08,ELAINE,"... Anyway I know you told him you didn't have the hat because you didn't want to see him again. And, more sympathetic I could not be. But, I really do need to have the hat back."
S08E08,HEATHER,"Look, I don't know what to tell you, but there's no hat here. I mean, maybe the maid took it, I had people over, but..."
S08E08,GEORGE,Well that makes sense.
S08E08,ELAINE,Well then you wouldn't mind if we took a second look around?
S08E08,HEATHER,Be my guest.
S08E08,GEORGE,Good to see you again.
S08E08,GEORGE,She's bluffing...
S08E08,ELAINE,Uhhh...
S08E08,GEORGE,... She's got it stashed away in there somewhere.
S08E08,ELAINE,This is an absolute disaster.
S08E08,GEORGE,Oh I don't know. Check this out.
S08E08,ELAINE,You stole her clock?
S08E08,ELAINE,Well done. (pats George on the shoulder)
S08E08,GEORGE,"Yep, this one for our side!"
S08E08,JERRY,"(Thinking) What is that creaking, its like I'm in the hold of a ship. Gotta relax."
S08E08,JERRY,"(startled - eyes wide open) Hello, is somebody there? (scurrying sound) Mr.- Mr. Marbles?"
S08E08,ELAINE,So I told Ipswitch I'd have the hat by this afternoon. What am I gonna do?
S08E08,KRAMER,You should sleep with him.
S08E08,JERRY,"Hey buddy. I'm on no sleep, no sleep!. You don't know what it's like in there, all night long things are creaking and cracking. And that red light is burning my brain!"
S08E08,ELAINE,You look a little stressed.
S08E08,JERRY,"Oh I'm stressed! (makes like Kramer, outstretching his arm. Jerry heads for the freezer for some ice cream.)"
S08E08,ELAINE,So Kramer what am I supposed to do? If I don't have that fur hat by four o'clock they're gonna take me down like Nixon.
S08E08,JERRY,You know my friend Bob Sacamano?
S08E08,ELAINE,I thought he was Kramer's friend.
S08E08,JERRY,"Well, he called last night about 3 a.m. and we got to talking, he sells Russian hats down at battery park, forty bucks."
S08E08,ELAINE,Forty bucks? Are they Sable?
S08E08,JERRY,"No, but the difference is negligible."
S08E08,KRAMER,"Oh yea, I like this idea. (sounding very much like Jerry)"
S08E08,ELAINE,"Alright, lets give it a shot, lets go."
S08E08,JERRY,Giddee up!
S08E08,NEWMAN,"It's getting cold, it's getting cold."
S08E08,KRAMER,That was a close one.
S08E08,NEWMAN,Well why do we have to keep this from Jerry?
S08E08,KRAMER,Because if Jerry finds out that I'm hooked on Roger's chicken I'm back there with the red menace.
S08E08,IPSWITCH,"Ms. Benes the hat you charged to the company was Sable, this is Nutria."
S08E08,ELAINE,"w-w- Well, that's a -ah, its kind of Sable."
S08E08,IPSWITCH,"No, its a kind of rat."
S08E08,ELAINE,That's a rat hat?
S08E08,IPSWITCH,"And a poorly made one, even by rat hat standards. I have no choice but to recommend your prompt termination to the board of directors. Nothing short of the approval of Peterman himself will save you this time."
S08E08,ELAINE,"But, but, he's in the Burmese jungle."
S08E08,IPSWITCH,And quite mad too from what I hear.
S08E08,ELAINE,"Wait a minute, wait a minute. Can I fire you?"
S08E08,IPSWITCH,No.
S08E08,KRAMER,So Heather called?
S08E08,GEORGE,"Yeah, but get this, the message said 'call me if you have the time'. Heh heh if I have the time, you get it?"
S08E08,KRAMER,"No, but this is all very exciting. (sounding very much like jerry)"
S08E08,GEORGE,She knows that I have her clock. I know that she has my hat. I think she's getting ready to make an exchange.
S08E08,KRAMER,Well there is the possibility that you've gone right out of your mind.
S08E08,GEORGE,"I've looked at that, seems unlikely."
S08E08,KRAMER,"I'd look again. So ah, how come you didn't call Jerry about all this?"
S08E08,GEORGE,"Jerry, I can't talk to Jerry anymore. Ever since he moved into that apartment he's too much ... like you."
S08E08,KRAMER,Hmm. That's a shame.
S08E08,JERRY,"Seth, you're the manager, can't you turn off that sign?"
S08E08,SETH,Jerry I lied. I'm just an assistant manager.
S08E08,SETH,"(On loud speaker) Number sixty seven, family feast."
S08E08,NEWMAN,"Number 67, right here, right here!"
S08E08,JERRY,Hello Newman.
S08E08,NEWMAN,Hello Jerry.
S08E08,SETH,And don't forget your steamed broccoli.
S08E08,JERRY,"Hold it. Broccoli? Newman, you wouldn't eat broccoli if it was deep fried in chocolate sauce."
S08E08,NEWMAN,"I love.. broccoli, its, good for you."
S08E08,JERRY,Really? Then maybe you'd like to have a piece?
S08E08,NEWMAN,"Gladly. (starts munching on the broccoli, then spits it out)"
S08E08,NEWMAN,Vile weed!
S08E08,JERRY,"It's Kramer isn't it? I knew it!  The greasy door knob the constant licking of the fingers, he's hooked to the chicken isn't he?"
S08E08,NEWMAN,"Yes, Yes, now please. Someone, honey mustard."
S08E08,KRAMER,"Newman, what took you... ah hey, hey"
S08E08,JERRY,Expecting Newman? That's funny because I just happened upon him down at the Kenny Roger's Roasters.
S08E08,KRAMER,"Oh, shh, Kenny Roger's? Whew, boy, I hate that place."
S08E08,JERRY,"He was buying quite a load of chicken, almost for two people ..."
S08E08,KRAMER,Oh
S08E08,JERRY,... as long as one of them is not him.
S08E08,KRAMER,"(laughs) Oh hey, you know Elaine, ah she stopped by..."
S08E08,JERRY,Uh-ha.
S08E08,KRAMER,"... Yeah dropped off that Bob Sacamano hat. Oh she's ah, upset at him, oh yes siree. Yeah well thanks for stopping by."
S08E08,JERRY,I sure do miss my apartment. Maybe I'll switch back.
S08E08,KRAMER,"Oh you don't want to think about that no sir. Otherwise I'd have no choice but to put that banner back up and eh, he-he-hwow, run that Roger's right out of town."
S08E08,JERRY,I don't think you will. As a matter of fact I'll save you the trouble. I'll do it myself.
S08E08,KRAMER,"Yeah, yeah go ahead yeah, put the banner up doesn't matter to me."
S08E08,JERRY,All right. (opens door - Red light floods hallway - a buzzing sound emanates.)
S08E08,KRAMER,"No Jerry! I - I need that chicken, I gotta have that chicken. Now you leave those roasters alone. Kenny never hurt anybody."
S08E08,JERRY,You got a little problem.
S08E08,KRAMER,Oh I got a big problem Jerry!
S08E08,BOY,"Here, kneel here."
S08E08,ELAINE,What?
S08E08,BOY,Kneel.
S08E08,ELAINE,Kneel?
S08E08,PETERMAN,Elaine.
S08E08,ELAINE,Mr. Peterman.
S08E08,PETERMAN,Jaba! Bagama ma Jaba. Olymala Hungui. (The boy runs out of the room)
S08E08,ELAINE,You speak Burmese?
S08E08,PETERMAN,"No Elaine, that was gibberish."
S08E08,ELAINE,Ah.
S08E08,PETERMAN,So did you have any trouble finding the place?
S08E08,ELAINE,"No, you're the only, white poet warlord in the neighborhood. (laughs)"
S08E08,PETERMAN,Are you an assassin?
S08E08,ELAINE,I - I work for your mail order catalog.
S08E08,PETERMAN,"You're an errand girl, sent by grocery clerks, to collect a bill."
S08E08,ELAINE,"Well actually um, I do have a bill here. If you could just sign, this expense form, I think I could still make the last fan boat out of here."
S08E08,PETERMAN,I'd be happy to Elaine (he starts reading the form as she hands him a pen)... but I will have to see this hat.
S08E08,ELAINE,Right... (nodding)
S08E08,GEORGE,So how do you want to do this?
S08E08,HEATHER,"Alright George, I'll be honest. The first time we went out, I found you very irritating. But after seeing you a couple of times, you sorta got stuck in my head, (sings) Ca-stan-za! (like ""By Mennen"") (laughs)"
S08E08,GEORGE,So you - you really don't have my hat?
S08E08,HEATHER,What?
S08E08,GEORGE,"Uh, le - let's go do, something."
S08E08,HEATHER,What's in the bag?
S08E08,GEORGE,"Oh that's eh, that's a sandwich."
S08E08,GEORGE,...ah (picks up the bag) Damn salami.
S08E08,HEATHER,"(grabs the bag) My clock, you stole it!"
S08E08,GEORGE,That damn delicatessen that - that is last time they screw up one of my orders.
S08E08,JERRY,Hey Seth. Man it is coming down hard out there.
S08E08,JERRY,"Oh, gross. That's not gonna be good for business."
S08E08,SETH,That's not gonna be good for anybody.
S08E08,KRAMER,(his mouth is very full) Kenny? ... Kenny?
S08E08,KRAMER,(quietly and staring across the street) Kenny .... Kenny ....... Kenny
S08E08,JERRY,Home at last. Ahhhh. (light turns off)
S08E08,JERRY,Is someone there?
S08E08,JERRY,Mr. Marbles?
S08E08,ELAINE,"This the Urban Sombrero, I put it on the last catalog cover."
S08E08,PETERMAN,The horror ... the horror.

S08E09,GEORGE,"Say you, me, and Kramer are, uh, flying over the Andes."
S08E09,JERRY,Why are we flyin' over the Andes?
S08E09,GEORGE,"We got a soccer game in Chile. Anyway, the plane crashes. Who are you gonna eat to survive?"
S08E09,JERRY,Kramer.
S08E09,GEORGE,So fast? What about me?
S08E09,JERRY,No.
S08E09,GEORGE,"Kramer's so stringy. I'm plump, juicy."
S08E09,JERRY,"Kramer's got more muscle, higher protein content. It's better for you."
S08E09,GEORGE,Well I would eat you.
S08E09,JERRY,"That's very nice, I guess."
S08E09,GEORGE,I still don't see why you wouldn't eat me. I'm your best friend.
S08E09,JERRY,"Look, if other people are having some, I'll try you."
S08E09,GEORGE,Thank you.
S08E09,JERRY,Can I have a piece of that?
S08E09,GEORGE,No.
S08E09,LOUISE,"George, I can't have sex."
S08E09,GEORGE,With me or in general?
S08E09,LOUISE,I went to the doctor today. I have mono.
S08E09,GEORGE,Nucleosis.
S08E09,LOUISE,Oh I hope it's not a problem for you.
S08E09,GEORGE,"No, no, pff..."
S08E09,LOUISE,How long is this not gonna be a problem for me?
S08E09,JERRY,Six weeks?
S08E09,GEORGE,"Yeah, six weeks."
S08E09,JERRY,"Well, so what? you've gone six weeks before."
S08E09,GEORGE,I can do six weeks standin' on my head. I'm a sexual camel. That's not the point. At least there was the possibility.
S08E09,JERRY,"Well, so, are you gonna break up with her?"
S08E09,GEORGE,I don't know. I don't wanna be one of those guys.
S08E09,JERRY,What guys?
S08E09,GEORGE,Like us. (Elaine enters)
S08E09,JERRY,Yeah.
S08E09,GEORGE,So it's just mono.
S08E09,ELAINE,"Mono? Huh, well, if anyone needs any medical advise, Elaine met a doctor. And he's unattached."
S08E09,JERRY,I thought the whole dream of dating a doctor was debunked.
S08E09,ELAINE,"No, it's not debunked, it's totally bunk."
S08E09,JERRY,"Isn't bunk bad? Like, that's a lot of bunk."
S08E09,GEORGE,No something is bunk and then you debunk it.
S08E09,JERRY,What?
S08E09,ELAINE,Huh?
S08E09,GEORGE,I think. (Pause as they all look down)
S08E09,ELAINE,"Look it, I'm dating a doctor and I like it. Let's just move on. (Phone rings)"
S08E09,JERRY,Hello?
S08E09,KATIE,Jerry.
S08E09,JERRY,"Oh hi, Katie."
S08E09,KATIE,"Listen, something just came up for Tuesday at the Dayton Civic Center. That's Ohio, Jerry."
S08E09,JERRY,"I've heard of Ohio, Katie. But Tuesday's no good. I'm doin' career day at my old junior high."
S08E09,KATIE,"Okay, Jerry. that's fine. you're the boss. Katie works for Jerry."
S08E09,JERRY,"Yes, all right, Katie."
S08E09,KATIE,Sorry for the late notice.
S08E09,JERRY,"Yes, bye."
S08E09,KATIE,You're the-- (He hangs up)
S08E09,GEORGE,They asked you to do career day?
S08E09,JERRY,"Yeah, it's no big deal."
S08E09,GEORGE,"Oh with all due respect, I went there too, and I work for a team that just won the World Series."
S08E09,JERRY,And you were integral.
S08E09,TEACHER,"Jerry, it was so nice of you to come down here."
S08E09,JERRY,"I'm on next, right?"
S08E09,TEACHER,"Well, unfortunately, Mr. O'Meary from the Bronx zoo..."
S08E09,JERRY,The guy with the lizard.
S08E09,TEACHER,"Yes. Well, he started feedin' it crickets, and the children just love him. And we're outta time."
S08E09,TEACHER,So can you come back tomorrow?
S08E09,JERRY,I'm getting bumped? You're bumping me from career day?
S08E09,ELAINE,So do most doctors like ER or do you guys just think it's fake?
S08E09,BEN,"I couldn't tell you. You know, I'm not really a doctor."
S08E09,ELAINE,"Oh, yeah. And I'm not really attracted to you."
S08E09,BEN,"Well, I'm serious, Elaine. I went to medical school, but I still have to pass my licensing exam."
S08E09,ELAINE,When do you take this exam?
S08E09,BEN,I've taken it. Three times. I almost passed the last one.
S08E09,ELAINE,"Well, you're basically a doctor. Right? I mean, people do call you doctor."
S08E09,BEN,"Well, um..."
S08E09,ELAINE,"Well, can I introduce you as doctor?"
S08E09,BEN,Yeah.
S08E09,ELAINE,"All right, that's all I wanted to know."
S08E09,LOUISE,Mono. (George removes hand)
S08E09,GEORGE,"It was fantastic, Jerry. We wound up talking all night."
S08E09,JERRY,So you're enjoying the not enjoying.
S08E09,GEORGE,"you know, just by conversing, you can really learn a lot about a person."
S08E09,JERRY,I'm finding that out. (Kramer enters)
S08E09,KRAMER,"Hey, buddy. How was career day?"
S08E09,JERRY,"Ah, I didn't get on. The lizard guy went long."
S08E09,GEORGE,You got bumped from career day?
S08E09,JERRY,"It was a mix-up, I'm sure."
S08E09,KRAMER,They're trying to screw with your head.
S08E09,JERRY,Now why would a junior high school want to screw with my head?
S08E09,KRAMER,Why does Radio Shack ask for your phone number when you buy batteries? I don't know.
S08E09,GEORGE,"Hey, hey. Kramer, what are you doing? You can't smoke in here."
S08E09,KRAMER,"No, come on. (Larry the cook comes over)"
S08E09,LARRY,Take it outside.
S08E09,KRAMER,"Come on, Larry. You know me."
S08E09,LARRY,"It bothers people, and it's against the law."
S08E09,JERRY,"You can make all the laws you want, he's still gonna bother people."
S08E09,KRAMER,"What, did they kick you out too?"
S08E09,MAN,"Yeah, they kicked us all out."
S08E09,TEACHER,"Thanks so much for coming back, Jerry. Care for a graham cracker?"
S08E09,JERRY,"No, let's just do it. (Fire alarm goes off) What? What is going on? What is that about?"
S08E09,TEACHER,Fire drill. Sorry. Single file everyone!
S08E09,JERRY,But I was promised this slot.
S08E09,TEACHER,"Single file, Jerry. (Jerry joins the line)"
S08E09,JERRY,"Fire drill, can you believe that?"
S08E09,GEORGE,What is Pericles?
S08E09,ALEX TREBEK,Pericles is correct.
S08E09,JERRY,Like fire in a school is such a big deal. (Kramer enters)
S08E09,KRAMER,"Hey, you got any matches?"
S08E09,JERRY,Middle drawer.
S08E09,GEORGE,Who is Sir Arthur Conan Doyle?
S08E09,ALEX TREBEK,We were looking for 'Who is Sir Arthur Conan Doyle.'
S08E09,KRAMER,"Thanks. (Kramer leaves, phone rings)"
S08E09,JERRY,Hello?
S08E09,KATIE,Jerry.
S08E09,JERRY,"Oh hi, Katie."
S08E09,KATIE,I heard what happened to the junior high. They can't bump you like that. That is so unprofessional.
S08E09,JERRY,"Oh relax, Katie. It's not a problem."
S08E09,GEORGE,What is Borax?
S08E09,ALEX TREBEK,"Yes, you're right."
S08E09,KATIE,"They bump you in junior high, the next thing you know you're being bumped in high schools, colleges, trade schools. Before you know it, Letterman's not returning your calls. (Kramer enters)"
S08E09,KRAMER,Ashtrays?
S08E09,JERRY,"No, I don't have any ashtrays."
S08E09,KRAMER,"Ooh, cereal bowls."
S08E09,KATIE,"Jerry, now don't freak out, I'll take care of it."
S08E09,JERRY,"No, Katie, don't-- (He hangs up phone)"
S08E09,KRAMER,"All right, thanks. (Kramer leaves)"
S08E09,GEORGE,What is Tungsten or Wolfram?
S08E09,ALEX TREBEK,"We were looking for 'What is Tungsten, or Wolfram'."
S08E09,JERRY,Is this a repeat?
S08E09,GEORGE,"No, no, no. Just lately, I've been thinking a lot clearer. Like this afternoon, (To television) what is chicken Kiev, (Back to Jerry) I really enjoyed watching a documentary with Louise."
S08E09,JERRY,"Louise! That's what's doin' it. You're no longer pre-occupied with sex, so your mind is able to focus."
S08E09,GEORGE,You think?
S08E09,JERRY,"Yeah. I mean, let's say this is your brain. (Holds lettuce head) Okay, from what I know about you, your brain consists of two parts the intellect, represented here (Pulls off tiny piece of lettuce), and the part obsessed with sex. (Shows large piece) Now granted, you have extracted an astonishing amount from this little scrap. But with no-sex-Louise, this previously useless lump, is now functioning for the first time in its existence. (Eats tiny piece of lettuce)"
S08E09,GEORGE,Oh my God. I just remembered where I left my retainer in second grade. I'll see ya. (He throws finished Rubik's cube to Jerry and he exits. Kramer enters)
S08E09,KRAMER,Need some more matches.
S08E09,JERRY,What is goin' on in there?
S08E09,KRAMER,"I met some people smoking on the street, so I invited them up to my apartment to smoke."
S08E09,JERRY,Why?
S08E09,KRAMER,"Well somebody had to. You know, just because a person's a smoker, that doesn't mean he's not a human being."
S08E09,JERRY,It doesn't?
S08E09,KRAMER,"Well you can confine them, you can punish them, you can cram them into the corner, but they're not going away, Jerry."
S08E09,JERRY,All right.
S08E09,KRAMER,Yeah.
S08E09,ELAINE,"So when they're handing you those cadavers, do you get to choose whether it's a man or a woman?"
S08E09,BEN,I dunno. Dead bodies really gross me out. (Sue Ellen Mischke enters with a man)
S08E09,ELAINE,Oh my God.
S08E09,BEN,What's wrong?
S08E09,ELAINE,"It's Sue Ellen Mischke, this old braless friend I hate. (Elaine tries to cover her face)"
S08E09,SUE ELLEN,Elaine? Hi.
S08E09,ELAINE,"Oh hi, Sue Ellen."
S08E09,SUE ELLEN,"Oh Rick, this is an old, old, friend of mine, Elaine Benes. Rick is a periodontist. He does Giuliani's gums."
S08E09,ELAINE,"Well, this is my boyfriend, doctor Ben Gelfen."
S08E09,BEN,"Well, I'm an intern."
S08E09,ELAINE,"Hey, stop kidding me. He's a doctor. He's a very good doctor."
S08E09,WOMAN,Carlitto's just passed out. Can anyone help?
S08E09,ELAINE,"Well, there's a doctor right here."
S08E09,BEN,No there's not.
S08E09,ELAINE,Can't you at least tell him what to do?
S08E09,BEN,Like what?
S08E09,SUE ELLEN,Shouldn't he elevate his legs?
S08E09,BEN,Right. Elevate your legs!
S08E09,ELAINE,I hope Carlitto feels better. Ben really wishes he could've helped.
S08E09,LARRY,I thought he was a doctor.
S08E09,ELAINE,"Oh he is. Kind of. I mean, I call him doctor. (She walks away and sees George sitting down reading books) George. (He holds up his hand to signal her to wait a second.)"
S08E09,GEORGE,Of course. Absolute zero!
S08E09,ELAINE,What? What is with all these books?
S08E09,GEORGE,I stopped having sex.
S08E09,KRAMER,"All right, I'll see ya Bill. All right, I got room for two, but the only thing I have is in the non-filter section. (Jerry enters) Hey."
S08E09,JERRY,"Hey. Wh-What'd you got, a smoker's lounge in there?"
S08E09,KRAMER,"Oh yeah, people really seem to be enjoying themselves. You know, they come in once, it's like they're addicted. (Katie enters)"
S08E09,KATIE,"Jerry, oh there you are. You didn't answer the phone."
S08E09,JERRY,I was out.
S08E09,KATIE,"Oh. Jerry, great news. I got you an assembly."
S08E09,JERRY,An assembly?
S08E09,KATIE,"Two hours in front of the entire junior high, grades six through eight. That's six grade, seventh grade--"
S08E09,JERRY,I understand. But what am I gonna talk about for two hours?
S08E09,KATIE,"And, it is already in the school paper. They cancelled Rick James."
S08E09,JERRY,Superfreak?
S08E09,KATIE,Yes.
S08E09,ELAINE,What is your answer to number 74?
S08E09,BEN,Medobolic acidosis.
S08E09,ELAINE,"No! Hypocalimia, not medibolic acidosis. Duh!"
S08E09,BEN,"Man, I'm never gonna pass this thing."
S08E09,ELAINE,Oh yes you are. We'll just stop having sex.
S08E09,GEORGE,"Guys, hitting is not about muscle. It's simple physics. Calculate the velocity, v, in relation to the trajectory, t, in which g, gravity, of course remains a constant. (Hits a home run) It's not complicated."
S08E09,JETER,Now who are you again?
S08E09,GEORGE,"George Costanza, assistant to the traveling secretary."
S08E09,WILLIAMS,Are you the guy who put us in that Ramada in Milwaukee?
S08E09,GEORGE,"Do you wanna talk about hotels, or do you wanna win some ball games?"
S08E09,JETER,We won the World Series.
S08E09,GEORGE,In six games.
S08E09,JERRY,"...so if you like to tell jokes, and love to make people laugh, stand-up comedy may be the career for you."
S08E09,GEORGE,Nine minutes.
S08E09,JERRY,How am I gonna fill two hours?
S08E09,GEORGE,Hello? I can take an hour off your hands. Give the kids a chance to see a real live Yankee.
S08E09,JERRY,And give you the chance to see some real disappointed kids. (Waitress comes to table)
S08E09,WAITRESS,More coffee?
S08E09,GEORGE,"Excuse me, darling, do I detect a Portuguese accent?"
S08E09,WAITRESS,Si
S08E09,GEORGE,Das kaffes un salat e grand por favor.
S08E09,WAITRESS,Mute pragalas senor
S08E09,GEORGE,"Eh, don't mention it."
S08E09,ELAINE,Portuguese?
S08E09,GEORGE,"Yeah, my cleaning lady's Portuguese. I must've picked it up."
S08E09,ELAINE,How come he's gettin' so smart? I stopped having sex with Ben three days ago and I don't know no Portuguese?
S08E09,JERRY,Are you all right?
S08E09,ELAINE,"I don't know. It's just the last coupla days my mind has been, not good."
S08E09,JERRY,"Wait a second, I know what's happening. The no sex thing is having a reverse effect on you."
S08E09,ELAINE,What? What are you talking about?
S08E09,JERRY,"To a woman, sex is like the garbage man. You just take for granted the fact that any time you put some trash out on the street, a guy in a jumpsuit's gonna come along and pick it up. But now, it's like a garbage strike. The bags are piling up in your head. The sidewalk is blocked. Nothing's getting through. You're stupid."
S08E09,ELAINE,I don't understand.
S08E09,JERRY,Exactly.
S08E09,KRAMER,Hey buddy.
S08E09,JERRY,Hey.
S08E09,KRAMER,"Hey, you should come over. Tonight's pipe night."
S08E09,JERRY,What? What happened to your face? It looks like an old catcher's mitt.
S08E09,KRAMER,"What? (Kramer checks it out.) My face is all craggly, it's crinkly."
S08E09,JERRY,It's from all that smoke. You've experienced a lifetime of smoking in 72 hours. What did you expect?
S08E09,KRAMER,"Emphysema, birth defects, cancer. But not this. Jerry, my face is my livelihood. Everything I have I owe to this face."
S08E09,JERRY,"And your teeth, your teeth are all brown."
S08E09,KRAMER,"Look away, I'm hideous."
S08E09,ELAINE,"Hey, Ben. I need a four letter word. Winnie the blank."
S08E09,BEN,Pooh!
S08E09,ELAINE,Pooh...(laughing)
S08E09,BEN,"No, it's Winnie the Pooh."
S08E09,LOUISE,"So the hospital called, turns out some stupid intern screwed up my test. I never had mono. So we can... you know."
S08E09,JERRY,So what did you do?
S08E09,GEORGE,I told her I would have to think about it.
S08E09,JERRY,"But ultimately, you're gonna choose in favor of sex, right?"
S08E09,GEORGE,I don't know. Perhaps I can better serve the world this way.
S08E09,JERRY,"You mean, not subjecting yourself to your sexual advances."
S08E09,GEORGE,Simple joke from a simple man.
S08E09,JERRY,So you're never gonna have sex again?
S08E09,GEORGE,"Well, Jerry. There was a pretty good chance I was never gonna have sex again anyway."
S08E09,JERRY,So you ready for the assembly tomorrow? You know what you're gonna say about the Yankees?
S08E09,GEORGE,"Oh, sports are so pedestrian. I've prepared some science experiments that will illuminate the mind and dazzle the eye."
S08E09,JERRY,I wrote a 20 minute bit about how homework stinks.
S08E09,JACKIE,"My vacation was restful, splendid, magnificent. In fact, next time I'm plannin' on going to Kofu."
S08E09,JACKIE,Oh no.
S08E09,KRAMER,Jackie we gotta talk.
S08E09,JACKIE,"No way, Kramer. You've brought nothing but a mountain of misfortune and humiliation. Now get out."
S08E09,KRAMER,But Jackie--
S08E09,JACKIE,I said out.
S08E09,KRAMER,"Jackie, I think I gotta case against the tobacco companies."
S08E09,JACKIE,The who?
S08E09,KRAMER,The tobacco companies.
S08E09,JACKIE,I've been wanting a piece of them for years.
S08E09,JACKIE,Did that cigarette warning label mention anything about damage to your appearance?
S08E09,KRAMER,"No, it didn't say anything."
S08E09,JACKIE,"So you're a victim. Now your face is shallow, unattractive, disgusting."
S08E09,KRAMER,"So Jackie, do you think we gotta case?"
S08E09,JACKIE,Your face is my case.
S08E09,JERRY,How ya doin'?
S08E09,ELAINE,Not good. I'm a moron.
S08E09,JERRY,"Well, don't worry about it. Once he passes the test, you'll have sex again, and you'll be fine."
S08E09,ELAINE,"Well, that kinda brings us to why I'm here. You got eleven minutes?"
S08E09,JERRY,What for? Oh come on.
S08E09,ELAINE,I just wanna clear my head. It has nothing to do with you.
S08E09,JERRY,I think it has something to do with me.
S08E09,ELAINE,You could read the paper through the whole thing if you want.
S08E09,JERRY,"(thinks about it for a second as to reconsider) No, no, no. I'm sorry, it's too weird."
S08E09,ELAINE,"Oh, all right. Is Kramer home?"
S08E09,GEORGE,"You know, Louise. I think you'll find this amusing. In early Euclidean geometry--"
S08E09,LOUISE,"George, I have to have sex."
S08E09,GEORGE,"I used to share that same outlook. But now, I have so many things to occupy my mind. For instance, the atom."
S08E09,LOUISE,"Goodbye, George. I hate you. (She leaves)"
S08E09,GEORGE,What a fascinating turn of events. (Waitress approaches)
S08E09,WAITRESS,Mas Caf?
S08E09,GEORGE,"Si, por favor."
S08E09,JACKIE,"Miss Wilkie, your tobacco company has turned this beautiful specimen, into a horrible twisted freak."
S08E09,KRAMER,Who could love me?
S08E09,WILKIE,"I disagree. In fact, I feel Mr. Kramer projects a rugged masculinity."
S08E09,JACKIE,"Rugged? The man's a goblin. He's only been exposed to smoke for four days. By the time this case gets to trial, he'll be nothing more than a shrunken head."
S08E09,WILKIE,"All right, Mr. Chiles. You'll have our offer by tomorrow. Good day, gentlemen. (She exits)"
S08E09,KRAMER,"Bye-bye. Jackie, you did it. We're rich."
S08E09,JACKIE,You better believe it. Jackie's cashin' in on your wretched disfigurement.
S08E09,ELAINE,Congratulations! You passed!
S08E09,BEN,"Elaine, Elaine. I don't think we should see each other anymore."
S08E09,ELAINE,What? you're breaking up with me? But I sacrificed and supported you while you struggled. What about my dream of dating a doctor?
S08E09,BEN,"I'm sorry, Elaine. I always knew that after I became a doctor, I would dump whoever I was with and find someone better. That's the dream of becoming a doctor."
S08E09,ELAINE,"Look it, are we going to have sex, or not?"
S08E09,KATIE,"Okay, Jerry, now when the glee club's finished singing, George goes on, then you. (George enters)"
S08E09,GEORGE,Hey.
S08E09,JERRY,"Where have you been? You know, you're on next."
S08E09,GEORGE,I got lost on the way over.
S08E09,JERRY,Got lost? We went to school here for three years.
S08E09,GEORGE,What are these? (Holds test tubes to his head like antennae) Take me to your leader.
S08E09,JERRY,Oh my God. You had sex. You had sex with Louise!
S08E09,GEORGE,"No, the Portuguese waitress."
S08E09,JERRY,The Portuguese waitress?
S08E09,GEORGE,"I calculated my odds of ever getting together with a Portuguese waitress. Mathematically, I had to do it, Jerry."
S08E09,KATIE,"George, George, you're on."
S08E09,GEORGE,"No, no. I'm not going on."
S08E09,JERRY,Then what'd you come down here for?
S08E09,GEORGE,Tell you about the Portuguese waitress.
S08E09,JERRY,It's good to have you back.
S08E09,KATIE,One of you has to go on.
S08E09,JERRY,"All right, I'll do it. (Goes on stage) Hey kids. What's the deal with homework? you're not working on your home! (Audience boos)"
S08E09,KRAMER,"It was a great lunch, Jackie. Thanks."
S08E09,JACKIE,It's a little puzzling we haven't gotten that offer yet.
S08E09,KRAMER,"Mrs. Wilkie, from the tobacco company called me. We had a little pow-wow."
S08E09,JACKIE,A pow-wow? Who told you to have a pow-wow? I didn't tell you to have pow-wow.
S08E09,KRAMER,She made an offer. I took it.
S08E09,JACKIE,How much?
S08E09,KRAMER,"No, no, no. There was no money."
S08E09,JACKIE,No money? Then what'd we get?
S08E09,KRAMER,Check it out. (They see a Marlboro man billboard with Kramer on it)
S08E09,JACKIE,This is the most public yet of my many humiliations.
S08E09,JERRY,Cancelled? But I was supposed to be on tomorrow night.
S08E09,LETTERMAN,"Yeah, but then, you know, some people were telling me about that little flap out there at the junior high assembly. And before that, you were bumped by a lizard?"
S08E09,JERRY,"Actually, it was a ********."
S08E09,LETTERMAN,"those things, deadly dangerous. A long time ago my uncle and a date are driving, like, through Mexico. They see one on the road, drags him out of the road, and chews his face off. Listen, we'll call you if anything opens up. Okay, Jimmy?"
S08E09,JERRY,Jerry.
S08E09,LETTERMAN,Right. Jerry.
S08E10,[Setting,Jerry's apartment]
S08E10,GEORGE,Jerry! (Slams the door) Georgie's moving out!
S08E10,JERRY,(Gets up) Get out!
S08E10,GEORGE,"I'm out! Fantastic apartment right across from mine, huh. I can't wait for you to see it."
S08E10,JERRY,(Looks around his apartment) Is it better than mine?
S08E10,GEORGE,(Definite) Oh yeah.
S08E10,JERRY,"So, it's a two-bedroom-one-bath-make-your-friends-hate-ya?"
S08E10,GEORGE,"You know what? it's better than Elaine's, too. I gotta give her a call. (Moves tward the phone)"
S08E10,JERRY,She's out.
S08E10,GEORGE,"(Stops) Oh right, the blind date."
S08E10,JERRY,"Yeah, well, they like to call it a set-up now. I guess the blind people don't like being associated with all those losers."
S08E10,GEORGE,Come on. Come check out my new place. It'll take you two minutes.
S08E10,JERRY,I can't. I'm meeting Kramer down at my mini-storage.
S08E10,GEORGE,"(Gloating) Hey, you got any extra furniture down there? I need some more stuff to fill that extra bedroom with the walk-in closet. (Smiles)"
S08E10,JERRY,"(Grabs his coat) Oh, this is really annoying."
S08E10,GEORGE,(Laughs as they leave) It's working already! (Both exit)
S08E10,[Setting,Manhattan Mini-storage]
S08E10,JERRY,(Disgusted) What is with that?!
S08E10,KRAMER,"Well, it's coughing, Jerry. It expells the diseased germs out of the body, into the air. (Makes a guesture of germs being in the air)"
S08E10,JERRY,(Takes out his key to unlock the unit door) Where is your key?
S08E10,KRAMER,"Yeah, well, uh, Newman. He's - he's got it."
S08E10,JERRY,"You know, Kramer, I rented out half of my space to you."
S08E10,KRAMER,"Yeah, and I rented out half that space to Newman. (Starts coughing again)"
S08E10,JERRY,(Picks one up) Mail bags? He's storing mail in here?
S08E10,KRAMER,(Looks at the bags on the floor) Evidently.
S08E10,[Setting,George's new apartment]
S08E10,RICARDI,"Excuse me, George? (H1)"
S08E10,GEORGE,"(Looks at her) Yeah, uh, no menus. (Waves her off)"
S08E10,RICARDI,"(Moves into the apartment, hand out) No, I'm Mrs. Ricardi - president of the tenant's association."
S08E10,GEORGE,"Oh, right! (Shakes her hand) Right! Hey, hey.. I love the floors in here. It's like a gymnasium in here! Try and guard me! (Dribbles an imaginary ball"
S08E10,RICARDI,"No, no.. (Laughs nervously) Uh, George, unfortunately, Clarance Eldridge in 8C has decided that he wants the apartment."
S08E10,GEORGE,"(Let down) Yeah, but you - you promised it to me."
S08E10,RICARDI,"Yes, but, you see - Mister Eldridge is an Andrea Doria survivor. And, in light of the terrible suffering that he's already been through, we've decided to give it to him."
S08E10,GEORGE,"(Depressed) Well,.. the Andrea Doria.. that was quite a fire. (Moves to the door, leaving)"
S08E10,RICARDI,(Correcting) Shipwreck.
S08E10,GEORGE,I remember.. (Leaves)
S08E10,[Setting,Restaurant]
S08E10,ELAINE,"Where is this guy?! (Checks her watch) I hate this! (Sighs) I shoulda brought something to read.. (Picks up a sugar packet) ""Cancer in labratory animals"".. huh."
S08E10,WAITER,"Excuse me, Elaine Benes?"
S08E10,ELAINE,Yeah?
S08E10,WAITER,"An Alan Mercer called for you. He said he's sorry, but he won't be able to make it tonight. (Pause) He's been stabbed."
S08E10,ELAINE,(Shocked) Stabbed?!
S08E10,WAITER,More bread?
S08E10,[Setting,Jerry's apartment]
S08E10,JERRY,(Talking to Elaine) You ate more bread?
S08E10,ELAINE,That is not the point! The guy was stabbed!
S08E10,JERRY,Did you find out who stabbed him?
S08E10,ELAINE,"Yeah, (Nodding) It turns out it was his ex-girlfriend."
S08E10,JERRY,"(Like a father) Well, you're not going near this hooligan anymore."
S08E10,ELAINE,"Well, I don't know.. I mean, think about it, Jerry. There must be something exciting about this guy if he can arouse that kind of passion. (Obviously turned on by the stabbing) I mean, to be stab-worthy.. You know, it's.. kind of a compliment."
S08E10,JERRY,"(Sarcastic) Yeah, too bad he didn't get shot. He could have been the one."
S08E10,KRAMER,(Coughs) Hey. How's everybody? (Moves to the kitchen)
S08E10,JERRY AND ELAINE,Hey.
S08E10,KRAMER,"Ehh.. (Picks up a carton of food) No expiration date on this.. (Opens it, then starts coughing directly onto the food)"
S08E10,JERRY,"There is now. Kramer, you should really get that cough checked out by a doctor."
S08E10,KRAMER,"(Shrugging it off) Nah, no, no, no. No doctors for me. A bunch of lackeys and yes-men all towing the company line.. (Looks at Jerry, then leans in so Elaine can't hear) Plus, the botched my vasectimy."
S08E10,JERRY,(In awe. Whispering) The botched it?
S08E10,KRAMER,(Complaining) I'm even more potent now!
S08E10,GEORGE,Hey.
S08E10,JERRY,Hey. How's the new place?!
S08E10,GEORGE,"Gone. (Moves over to a chair in the living room. Kramer takes the carton of food to the table, and begins eating) The tenant association made me give it to this guy because he was an Andrea Doria survivor.."
S08E10,ELAINE,Andrea Doria? Isn't that the one they did the song about?
S08E10,JERRY,(Correcting her) Edmund Fitzgerald.
S08E10,ELANE,I love Edmund Fitzgerald's voice.
S08E10,JERRY,"(Gives Elaine a look) No, Gordon Lightfoot was the singer. Edmund Fitzgerald was the ship."
S08E10,GEORGE,(Talking about his would-be apartment) You could fit 15 people in that bathroom..
S08E10,ELAINE,I think Gordon Lightfoot was the boat.
S08E10,JERRY,"(Sarcastic) Yeah, and it was rammed by the Cat Stevens."
S08E10,KRAMER,(Like a teacher) The Andrea Doria collided with the Stockholm in dense fog 21 miles off the coast of Nantucket. (Makes a clicking sound with his tongue)
S08E10,GEORGE,How do you know?
S08E10,KRAMER,"it's in my book - ""Astonishing Tales of the Sea"" 51 people died."
S08E10,GEORGE,"51 people?! That's it?! I thought it was, like, a thousand!"
S08E10,KRAMER,"There were 1,650 survivors."
S08E10,GEORGE,"That's no tragedy! How many people do you lose on a normal cruse? 30? 40?! Kramer, can I take a look at that book? (Starts walking tward the door. Kramer grabs his food, and follows)"
S08E10,KRAMER,"Oh yeah. I also got ""Astounding Bear Attacks"""
S08E10,JERRY,"Hey, uh, before you go, did you talk to Newman about getting that mail outta there?"
S08E10,KRAMER,"Yeah, oh, yeah. Yeah, he's not gonna do it. (Leaves)"
S08E10,[Setting,Newman's apartment]
S08E10,JERRY,Newman?
S08E10,NEWMAN,(Eyes glued to the TV) I guess.
S08E10,JERRY,"Listen, I want you to get the mail outta my storage unit."
S08E10,NEWMAN,Sometimes we don't get what we want.
S08E10,JERRY,(Confused) What are you talking about?
S08E10,NEWMAN,I didn't get my transfer.
S08E10,JERRY,"""Transfer""?"
S08E10,NEWMAN,"To Hawaii. The most sought-after postal route of them all. The air is so dewy-sweet you don't even have to like the stamps.. But it's not to be - So, I'm hanging it up."
S08E10,JERRY,You quit the post office?
S08E10,NEWMAN,"Kind of. I'm still collecting checks, I'm just not delivering mail."
S08E10,JERRY,"Well, get it out of my storage. It's illegal."
S08E10,NEWMAN,"And yet, it's perfectly legal to take a man's soul and crush it out like a stale Pall Mall."
S08E10,JERRY,"(Cheerfully) Well, a law's a law. (Leaves)"
S08E10,[Setting,Central Park]
S08E10,KRAMER,"Ok, hold on there.. That's a nasty cough you got there, huh?"
S08E10,MAN,What cough?
S08E10,[Setting,Restaurant]
S08E10,ELAINE,"I love shrimp! (Waves her knife around as she's talking) I'm a shrimp eater. You put shrimp infront of me, (Waves her knife along with her hand gestures. Alan is getting edgy about it, and even more so with every wave) and I will eat it until my stomach pops! (Notices Alan's unsettled) Oh.. (Puts the knife down)"
S08E10,ALAN,"No, it's okay. I'm.. still just a little bit jumpy."
S08E10,ELAINE,"(Leans in close) Between you and me, what happened there with the stabbing?"
S08E10,ALAN,"Just.. one of those things, you know."
S08E10,ELAINE,What? Was she just so crazy in love with you that she just couldn't take it anymore? Or..?
S08E10,ALAN,I don't know. Could be.
S08E10,CAROL,Alan?!
S08E10,ALAN,Carol?
S08E10,ELAINE,"(Gets up, pointing after Carol) Was that the one?! Was that the one who stabbed you?!"
S08E10,ALAN,"(Between screams) No, that was a different girl."
S08E10,[Setting,Coffee shop]
S08E10,JERRY,There was another crazed ex-girlfriend?
S08E10,ELAINE,"Right, so, I called my friend, you know - the one who set us up - I found out, he's a bad-breaker-upper."
S08E10,JERRY,Mmm.. Bad how?
S08E10,ELAINE,"(Fast) Well, you know when you break up, how you say things you don't mean? Well, he says the mean things you don't mean, but he means them."
S08E10,JERRY,(Nods) I follow. So what are you gonna do?
S08E10,ELAINE,"Dump him. I can't be with someone who doesn't break up nicely. I mean, to me, that's one of the most important parts of a relationship."
S08E10,JERRY,(Agreeing) What's more important?
S08E10,[Setting,NYC Street]
S08E10,KRAMER,(Between coughs) Hey.
S08E10,GEORGE,What's with the dog?
S08E10,KRAMER,"(Petting Smuckers) Yeah, this is Smuckers. I borrowed him. (Starts coughing)"
S08E10,GEORGE,Oh..
S08E10,KRAMER,"(Pointing at the dog) Yeah, we share the same affliction, so I'm gonna have a vet check us out."
S08E10,GEORGE,A vet?
S08E10,KRAMER,"Oh, I'll take a vet over an M.D. any day. They gotta be able to cure a (Snaps his fingers in rhythm with his words) lizard, a chicken, a pig, a frog (Stops snapping) - all on the same day."
S08E10,GEORGE,"So, if I may jump ahead - you're gonna take dog medicine?"
S08E10,KRAMER,"(Smiling) You bet we are! Huh, Smuckers? (Smuckers coughs. They turn to leave) I'll see ya."
S08E10,[Setting,George's apartment building]
S08E10,GEORGE,Ahoy! Mr. Eldridge. I understand you were on the Andrea Doria.
S08E10,ELDRIDGE,"Yes, it was a terrifying ordeal."
S08E10,GEORGE,"I tell ya, I hear people really stuff themselves on those cruise ships. (Laughs) The buffet, that's the real ordeal, huh, Clarence? (Laughs)"
S08E10,ELDRIDGE,(Defensively) We had to abandon ship.
S08E10,GEORGE,"Well, all vacations have to end eventually."
S08E10,ELDRIDGE,The boat sank.
S08E10,GEORGE,"(Holding up Kramer's book) According to this, it took.. 10 hours. It eased into the water like an old man into a nice warm bath - no offence. (Pause) So, uh, Clarence, how about abandoning this apartment, and letting me shove off in this beauty?"
S08E10,ELDRIDGE,"Is that what this is all about?! I don't think I like you. (Enters his apartment, and slams the door behind him)"
S08E10,GEORGE,"(Yelling out) It's my apartment, Eldridge! The Stalkholm may not have sunk ya, but I will! Ha, ha, ha!"
S08E10,[Setting,Vet's office]
S08E10,VET,What are the symptoms?
S08E10,KRAMER,"Well, uh.. it hurts when he swallows. Expecially when he drinks orange juice. (Vet gives him a look) I mean, uh.. dog food.. juice. (Adding) What's worse - he has a nagging cough. (Smucker's coughs) Yeah, that's it. That's it."
S08E10,VET,"Yeah, well, uh - we've been seeing a lot of this lately. Been drinking from the toilet?"
S08E10,KRAMER,(Offended) What? No. That's disgusting..
S08E10,[Setting,Coffee shop]
S08E10,ALAN,"So that's it? We're, uh, we're breakin' up?"
S08E10,ELAINE,(Confused by his sudden change-of-heart) What? Break-up? We went out on one date.
S08E10,ALAN,"(Fast) Ok, yeah, sure, fine, right. Whatever you say."
S08E10,ELAINE,"(Shows no sign that she cares) Alright, good. Good."
S08E10,ALAN,"Ok, then, well, So.. see ya around.. big head. (Gets up to leave)"
S08E10,ELAINE,Pardon?
S08E10,ALAN,You got a big head. It's too big for your body. (Walks for the door)
S08E10,ELAINE,(Laughing out loud) That's it?! (Laughs again) That's the best you got?! (Laughs loudly as Alan exits)
S08E10,[Setting,Jerry's apartment]
S08E10,GEORGE,"So, he's keeping the apartment. He doesn't deserve it, though! Even if he did suffer, that was, like, 40 years ago! What has he been doing lately?! I've been suffering for the past 30 years up to and including yesterday!"
S08E10,JERRY,"You know, if this tenant board is so impressed with suffering, maybe you should tell them the ""Astonishing Tales of Costanza""."
S08E10,GEORGE,(Interested) I should!
S08E10,JERRY,"I mean, your body of work in this field is unparalleled."
S08E10,GEORGE,I could go bumper to bumper with any one else on this planet!
S08E10,JERRY,You're the man!
S08E10,NEWMAN,Jerry!
S08E10,JERRY,"I'm with people, I'll be with you in a moment. (Slams the door on Newman's face. Then tries to delay talking to Newman by keeping the conversation with George going) So, you want a protein shake, or something?"
S08E10,GEORGE,"Nah, I guess I should really get moving on this, huh? I'm gonna go. (Opens the door, letting Newman in. Leaves)"
S08E10,JERRY,(Angered) Hello.. Newman.
S08E10,NEWMAN,"(Urgent) I need that mail, where is it?!"
S08E10,JERRY,What's the difference?
S08E10,NEWMAN,The guy who had the Hawaii transfer got busted for hoarding Victoria Secret catalogues. I gotta deliver that mail!
S08E10,JERRY,"Well, go ahead. There's 8 bags of it."
S08E10,NEWMAN,"Blast! There's no way I can handle 8 in addition to my ususal load of one! I'll never get to Hawaii! (Moves over to Jerry's couch, depressed) I'll be stuck in this apartment building forever! (Lays down on Jerry's couch) The dream is dead."
S08E10,JERRY,You're giving up that easy?
S08E10,NEWMAN,I usually do. (Gets up to leave) See ya.
S08E10,JERRY,"(Stopping him) No, wait a minute, Newman! You can't let this dream die. You moving away is my dream too!"
S08E10,NEWMAN,(Intrigued) What are you proposing?
S08E10,JERRY,"(Fast) Whatever it takes, for as long as it takes me, where ever it takes me as long as it takes you away from me!"
S08E10,NEWMAN,An alliance?
S08E10,JERRY,(Confirming) An alliance. (They both shake hands and laugh evily) Now get the hell outta here. (Newman leaves)
S08E10,[Setting,Jerry's apartment]
S08E10,ELAINE,Hawaii? That's why you're helping Newman with the mail?
S08E10,JERRY,"(Like an Army general) Elaine, Newman is my sworn enemy. And he lives down the hall from my home - my home, Elaine! Where I sleep, where I come to play with my toys."
S08E10,ELAINE,"Well, anyway, get this I spoke to Alan. You know, I told him I didn't want to see him anymore.. He called me ""big head""."
S08E10,JERRY,"""Big head"" (Scoffs) That's almost a compliment."
S08E10,ELAINE,(Agreeing) It's one of the nicest things anyone's ever said to me.
S08E10,JERRY,Hello?
S08E10,GEORGE,(On the other line) Hey.
S08E10,JERRY,"Hey, George."
S08E10,GEORGE,"Yeah, listen, I can't make it later."
S08E10,JERRY,You can't make it?
S08E10,GEORGE,"Yeah, the tenant association has decided to hear my side of the story. So, uh, I gotta kinda get ready. I'll see ya."
S08E10,JERRY,Alright. (Hangs up)
S08E10,ELAINE,Is he not gonna go to the coffee shop?
S08E10,JERRY,(Saddened) Doesn't look like it's gonna happen.
S08E10,ELAINE,"(Gives a ""That's a shame"" face) Alright, well, I'll see ya. (Opens the door to exit. Kramer enters coughing. Elaine does her best to dodge out of the way of Kramer's coughs, then walks off)"
S08E10,JERRY,"Kramer, aren't you taking any medication for that?"
S08E10,KRAMER,"Yeah, yeah. (Pulls a bottle out of his pocket) I got some pilss. They taste terrible."
S08E10,JERRY,(Takes the bottle from him) Just swallow 'em.
S08E10,KRAMER,"(Gestures to his throat) No, my throat's too tender."
S08E10,JERRY,"Alright, sit down, sit down. (Grabs a pill from the bottle, and starts advancing tward Kramer - like an owner with his dog)"
S08E10,KRAMER,I don't want to!
S08E10,JERRY,C'mon. Just sit down!
S08E10,KRAMER,(Squirming) Jerry! What?!
S08E10,JERRY,Sit down! Sit down!
S08E10,KRAMER,(Struggling) Hey!
S08E10,JERRY,Lean your head back. Open your mouth! (Grabs Kramer's head) Open your mouth! Open it! Open it!
S08E10,JERRY,"(Reads the pill bottle) What kind of pills are these, anyways?! ""For Smuckers""? ""May cause panting and loss of fur""? (Turns to Kramer) These are dog pills!"
S08E10,KRAMER,Whe have the same symptoms.
S08E10,JERRY,"But, he's a dog! You need to see a real doctor."
S08E10,KRAMER,"No, no. No doctors."
S08E10,JERRY,"Alright.. (Heads for the door, grabbing his coat)"
S08E10,KRAMER,Where are you going?
S08E10,JERRY,I'm taking the car. I gotta run some errands. You want to go?
S08E10,KRAMER,I don't know..
S08E10,JERRY,"(Opens the door) C'mon, you wanna go for a ride? (Starts jiggling his keys - as if he's calling out for a dog) Huh? C'mon! C'mon!"
S08E10,[Setting,Taxi cab]
S08E10,DRIVER,"Lady, could you move your head a little bit?"
S08E10,ELAINE,What?
S08E10,DRIVER,Your head. I can't see out the back. (Elaine slumps down in her seat) Little more.. (Elaine slumps lower) ..Little more. (Slides down until just her eyes and forehead can be seen) Thank you.
S08E10,[Setting,Jerry's car]
S08E10,KRAMER,"I don't see any tissues back her.. (Looks out the windows) Wait a minute!.. (Jerry looks like he's trying to keep something from Kramer) This isn't the way to the park! (Starts getting even more energetic) Where are we going?.. I recognize this block! (Looks at Jerry, scared) You're taking me to the doctor!"
S08E10,[Setting,Coffee shop]
S08E10,GEORGE,"So, uh, Mom, Dad, I was hoping that you could help me to remember my childhood a little clearly.."
S08E10,ESTELLE,I feel a draft. (Grabs the bread basket and her drink) Let's change tables.
S08E10,FRANK,Get outta here! We have a booth.
S08E10,ESTELLE,"Frank, I'm cold!"
S08E10,FRANK,Order a hot dish.
S08E10,ESTELLE,Why can't we sit over there? (Points to a table)
S08E10,FRANK,(Yelling) That's not a booth!
S08E10,ESTELLE,"(Trying to match Frank's loudness) So, who says we have to sit in a booth?!"
S08E10,FRANK,(Loud shouting) I didn't take the subway all the way to New York to sit at a table like that! (Gestures to the table)
S08E10,ESTELLE,"(Nagging yell) Well, I didn't take the subway to be in a drafty restaurant!"
S08E10,GEORGE,(Pleading for them to stop) Mom.. dad.
S08E10,FRANK,"Now, George, what do you want to know about your childhood?"
S08E10,GEORGE,"(Fed up with his parents) Actually, I think I'm pretty clear on it."
S08E10,FRANK,(Looks up) Where's that breeze coming from?
S08E10,[Setting,NYC Street]
S08E10,JERRY,"Kramer, outta the car. Out, now!"
S08E10,KRAMER,"No, Jerry!"
S08E10,JERRY,"Alright, that's it.. (Grabs Kramer, trying to pull him out of the car)"
S08E10,KRAMER,No! Don't!
S08E10,JERRY,"Hey, hey! Get back over here! Kramer! Get over here! You are bad! Bad neighbor! Kramer!"
S08E10,[Setting,Tenant board room]
S08E10,ELDRIDGE,"Just then, a rescue ship emerged from the fog and saved us. It was.. (Stops, then gives George a look. George stops knocking on the walls) It was the sweetest sight my eyes ever saw."
S08E10,RICARDI,(Touched) Thank you Mr. Eldridge. The tenant board will now hear Mr. Costanza's testimony.
S08E10,[Setting,Newman's apartment]
S08E10,JERRY,"Newman, how'd it go? Did you get it all delivered? (Sees the pac) What happened?"
S08E10,NEWMAN,Kramer bit me!
S08E10,JERRY,Bit you?!
S08E10,NEWMAN,"We had an arguement about me going to Hawaii, and he locked onto my ankle like it was a soup bone. I'm hubbled! I don't think I can do my route - and they're awarding the transfer in two days!"
S08E10,JERRY,"(Bravely) Well, what if I deliver it?"
S08E10,NEWMAN,You?! (Laughs hysterically) You can't deliver mail!
S08E10,JERRY,"Well, why not?"
S08E10,NEWMAN,(Thinks for a moment) I guess you're right. It's just walking around putting it into boxes..
S08E10,JERRY,What am I gonna wear?
S08E10,NEWMAN,I could give you my uniform from my rookie year.
S08E10,JERRY,(Excited) I can't believe I'm gonna be a mailman!
S08E10,JERRY,(Hands him some mail) There you go. Merry Chirstmas!
S08E10,OWNER,Mail on Sunday?
S08E10,JERRY,"(Shrugs) Oops. (Continues walking along the route, whistling. Hands a newspaper to a homeless bum on the street, then keeps walking)"
S08E10,[Setting,Tenant board room]
S08E10,GEORGE,"I was handcuffed to the bed.. In my underwear, (Sighs) where I remained.. (Scene cuts to another story) She was attractive.. She was, also, infact, a Nazi.. (Cuts to another story) The water.. that I had been swiming in was.. very cold. And, when I dropped the towel, there was.. significant shrinkage.. (Scene cuts to, yet, another story) Her parents were looking at me.. So, there I was, with a marble rye hanging from the end of a fishing pole.. (Scene cuts to his closing statements) In closing, these stories have not been embellished, because - they need no embellishment. They are simply, horrifyingly, the story of my life as a short, stocky, slow witted bald man. (Gets up) Thank you. (Every memeber of the board shows some sign that George's story is most deserving of the apartment. Ricardi is crying. George turns to leave, then remembers one more thing..) Oh, also.. my fiance died from licking toxic envelopes that I picked out. (Sobs and loud crying erupts from the board members) Thanks again. (Leaves. Eldridge looks defeated)"
S08E10,[Setting,Newman's apartment]
S08E10,JERRY,"Hey, I've been trying to jam stuff in the box, like you told me, but sometimes it says, like, ""Photographs - Do not bend""."
S08E10,NEWMAN,"""Do not bend"". (Laughs evilly) Just crease, crumple, cram.. you'll do fine. (Phone rings. Newman answers it) Hello?.. This is he. I don't understand.. very well. (Hangs up in disappointment)"
S08E10,JERRY,What?
S08E10,NEWMAN,That was the Vice President of the post office. I didn't get the transfer.. They knew it wasn't me doing my route!
S08E10,JERRY,How did they know?!
S08E10,NEWMAN,(Stands up) Too many people go their mail! Close to 80%. No body from the post office has ever cracked the 50% barrier! It's like the 3-minute mile!
S08E10,JERRY,(Pleading) I tried my best!
S08E10,NEWMAN,Exactly. You're a disgrace to the uniform. (Newman takes off Jerry's mailman hat. Jerry turns his head in shame. Newman then tears the post office badge from Jerry's coat)
S08E10,JERRY,"You know, this is your coat."
S08E10,NEWMAN,(Realizing) Damn!
S08E10,[Setting,Central park]
S08E10,MAN 2,He flew right into your head. Like he couldn't avoid it.
S08E10,ELAINE,(Rubbing her head to relieve the pain) Really?
S08E10,MAN 2,Never seen that before. Bird into a woman's head..
S08E10,[Setting,Coffee shop]
S08E10,GEORGE,"It's not contest. The guy had nothing! The ship went down, he got into a life boat, I mean, come on."
S08E10,JERRY,"Boy, he didn't know what he was up against. (George laughs) So, when do you move into the apartment?"
S08E10,GEORGE,They're making their decision today.
S08E10,JERRY,What's the matter with you?
S08E10,ELAINE,Nothing.. Except that a bird ran into my giant freak-head. (Sits down)
S08E10,JERRY,What giant freak-head?
S08E10,ELAINE,"(Annoyed, near tears) The one that sits atop my disproportunately puny body.. I'm a walking candy apple!"
S08E10,JERRY,"So, it's actually gotten to you? You're playing right into his hands!"
S08E10,ELAINE,"(Realizing) What? Yeah.. you're right!.. All I have to do is call him up, and sit with him, and show him that it doesn't bother me. You know, laugh it off.. or jam a fork into his forehead."
S08E10,JERRY,"(Casually, sarcastic) Either way."
S08E10,ELAINE,(Getting up to leave) Alright.
S08E10,[Setting,Restaurant]
S08E10,ALAN,I want to apologize for..
S08E10,ELAINE,"(Shrugging it off) Oh, please."
S08E10,ALAN,So you have a big head.
S08E10,ELAINE,(Casually playing along) So what?
S08E10,ALAN,It goes well with that bump in your nose.
S08E10,ELAINE,(Suddenly angry) What?!
S08E10,WOMAN,"Please! Get help! There's a crazy big-headed woman beating up some guy! Tell the police ""The Old Mill Restaurant"". Hurry!"
S08E10,COP,"Boy, that's some cough you got there."
S08E10,COP 2,"No, I think he's trying to tell us something. What is it? (Between coughs, Kramer manages to say the word ""trouble"") Trouble?! Trouble? Where? Where's trouble? (Kramer coughs out the words ""Old Mill"") Trouble at the Old Mill?! Oh my god! Good boy, good boy! Lead the way! Come on."
S08E10,[Setting,George's apartment building]
S08E10,GEORGE,"Excuse me, uh, what are you doing in there?"
S08E10,ALAN,I'm moving in. Alan Mercer. New neighbor. (They shake hands)
S08E10,GEORGE,What? Elaine's big-head guy? They have you the apartment?!
S08E10,ALAN,Yeah.
S08E10,GEORGE,"Why?! Because you were stabbed, and.. got coffee thrown in your face, and.. uh.. (Points to Alan's bandaged forehead)"
S08E10,ALAN,"Oh, fork in the forehead."
S08E10,GEORGE,That's why they gave you the apartment?
S08E10,ALAN,"No, I just gave the super 50 bucks."
S08E10,GEORGE,"Wait a minute, that is my apartment. I earned it with 34 years of misery!"
S08E10,ALAN,"Tough luck, chinless. (Goes into his new apartment, and slams the door on George)"
S08E11,JERRY,"So what happened to you yesterday? We were supposed to go to the auto show, I waited for you, you never came."
S08E11,ELAINE,"I'm sorry, I got really busy. How long did you wait?"
S08E11,JERRY,Five minutes.
S08E11,ELAINE,Five minutes? That's it?
S08E11,JERRY,What's the difference? You never showed up.
S08E11,ELAINE,"I could've! I mean, last week we waited for that friend of Kramer's for like, forty minutes."
S08E11,JERRY,"Well, we barely knew the guy."
S08E11,ELAINE,"So, the longer you know someone, the shorter you wait for 'em."
S08E11,JERRY,That's the way it works.
S08E11,ELAINE,When did you tell George to be here?
S08E11,JERRY,I told him to meet us here in ten minutes. How long has it been?
S08E11,ELAINE,About five.
S08E11,JERRY,That's enough. (They leave. George comes around the corner.)
S08E11,GEORGE (looks at his watch),Early! Alright! (shivers.) Cold.
S08E11,KRAMER,"So, I noticed you bounced a check at the bodega."
S08E11,JERRY,How did you know about that?
S08E11,KRAMER,"Because Marcelino, he taped it up on his cash register with all the other bad checks."
S08E11,JERRY,He can't do that.
S08E11,KRAMER (sternly),"It's the only way you'll learn. (Tastes his eggs.) Aw, these eggs are disgusting. This chicken should be ashamed of himself."
S08E11,GEORGE,Fantastic day! Fantastic!
S08E11,JERRY,What happened?
S08E11,GEORGE,"(laughs - hehe) Well, first, I'm brushing my teeth and this piece of apple-skin, that must have been lodged in there for days, comes loose."
S08E11,JERRY,Fantastic.
S08E11,GEORGE,"Then, I'm at The Foundation..."
S08E11,JERRY,You're still doing that?
S08E11,GEORGE,"Sometimes, once in a while."
S08E11,JERRY,When you feel guilty.
S08E11,GEORGE,"No, occasionally I'll forget to let the machine pick up. Anyway, they made this large donation, to a women's prison, and I get to go down there and check it out."
S08E11,KRAMER,That's caged heat.
S08E11,GEORGE,Yeah-hah!
S08E11,JERRY,What are you gonna do there?
S08E11,GEORGE,"Nothing really, you know...just eh, stroll around the cell blocks, maybe eh, take in a shower fight. (chuckles.) Hey eh, you know you got a bounced check hanging up in the little market over on Columbus?"
S08E11,JERRY,"Yes, I know, I know."
S08E11,GEORGE,"I noticed you eh, chose the eh ""clowns with balloons"" check design."
S08E11,JERRY,"It was a mistake, the bank sent me the wrong ones."
S08E11,ELAINE,"Hey! Look who's here! Hey Kurt, this is Jerry, and George, and Kramer."
S08E11,KRAMER,"Hey, Kurt. Taste these eggs."
S08E11,KURT,"Uh, no - I only eat cage-free, farm-fresh."
S08E11,KRAMER,Yes! These are sweatshop eggs.
S08E11,KURT (to Elaine),"Ah, I gotta call the office. Honey, will you order for me?"
S08E11,ELAINE (sitting down),"I'm a ""honey."" He's pretty great, huh?"
S08E11,JERRY,Is he from the future?
S08E11,ELAINE,"No, he just shaves his head. I think it's pretty gutsy."
S08E11,GEORGE,"Listen, sweetheart, let me tell you a little something about guts. (Points to his head.) This is guts."
S08E11,ELAINE,What? Clinging to some scraps?
S08E11,GEORGE,"These are not ""scraps."" These are historic remains of a once Great Society of Hair."
S08E11,ELAINE,"Oh, did you guys stop at the bodega today? Some moron bounced a clown check!"
S08E11,"[The Bodega, starts with a shot of Marcelino's cash register with Jerry's clown check attached under a sign that reads ""checks no longer accepted from",""".]"
S08E11,"Check #1246, dated Dec. 15 96, Made out to",Columbus Deli for $40.00
S08E11,JERRY,"Again, I'm really sorry about the check, Marcelino."
S08E11,MARCELINO,People seem to like the clowns.
S08E11,JERRY (takes out his wallet),"Look, let me just give you the forty, plus another twenty for your trouble."
S08E11,MARCELINO,'Kay.
S08E11,JERRY (turning to leave),Aren't you going to take the check down?
S08E11,MARCELINO,"Sorry, no. It's store policy."
S08E11,JERRY,But it's your bodega.
S08E11,MARCELINO,Even I am not above the policy.
S08E11,BETSY,Those are our tennis courts.
S08E11,GEORGE,Tennis courts? W-w-what about the yard? Where do they have the gang fights?
S08E11,BETSY,"There's no fights here, Mr. Costanza. This is a minimum security facility."
S08E11,GEORGE,"Hmm. What about a hole? You ever put anybody in ""the box""?"
S08E11,BETSY,No.
S08E11,GEORGE (to himself),This prison stinks.
S08E11,BETSY,"And finally, the library, which has just been refurbished thanks to your generous donation. This is Celia Morgan, our librarian."
S08E11,CELIA,Nice to meet you.
S08E11,BETSY,I'll be in my office if you need me.
S08E11,GEORGE,"Thanks, Warden."
S08E11,BETSY (sweetly),Betsy.
S08E11,GEORGE (disappointed),Betsy.
S08E11,CELIA,"So, are you the head of the foundation?"
S08E11,GEORGE,"Well, let's just say it wouldn't exist without me. (Notices another person in the library dressed the same as Celia.) So you two uh, shop at the same store, (hu)?"
S08E11,CELIA,"No, it's standard issue."
S08E11,GEORGE,Oh my God...You're in jail? (Celia nods.) That is so cool!
S08E11,JERRY,You asked her out?
S08E11,GEORGE,"Well...not ""out."" She's a prisoner."
S08E11,JERRY,How could you ask her out?
S08E11,GEORGE,Why not?
S08E11,JERRY,I remember when you wouldn't date that girl who lived in Queens because you didn't want to go over the bridge!
S08E11,GEORGE,That was different!
S08E11,JERRY,I'll say.
S08E11,GEORGE,"Jerry, I like being with her. Plus, I know where she is all the time. I have relatively no competition. An-and you know how you live in fear of the pop-in?"
S08E11,JERRY (shudders),The pop-in.
S08E11,GEORGE,"Yeah, no pop-in, no ""in the neighborhood,"" no ""I saw your light was on."" And the best part is, if things go really well..."
S08E11,JERRY,Conjugal visit?
S08E11,GEORGE (giddy),Don't jinx it! Don't jinx (trails off quietly in elation)
S08E11,KRAMER,Hey.
S08E11,GEORGE,Hey.
S08E11,KRAMER,What's up?
S08E11,JERRY,George is dating a convict.
S08E11,KRAMER,Oh? What's she in for? (putting groceries in the fridge)
S08E11,GEORGE,Embezzlement.
S08E11,KRAMER (approvingly),"Sounds like a nice girl. Hey Jerry, is it all right if I put some stuff in your fridge? 'Cause mine's full."
S08E11,JERRY,"Yeah, sure. You don't even have a fridge, do you?"
S08E11,KRAMER,"Well, not here."
S08E11,KRAMER,Okay (lifting the bag and carrying it into the apt.)
S08E11,JERRY,"Kramer, Kramer, wait a minute, what the hell is that?"
S08E11,KRAMER,"Well, it's chicken feed. (Slams the bag into Jerry's fridge.)"
S08E11,JERRY,I sense something is afoot.
S08E11,KRAMER,"Yeah, I bought a chicken."
S08E11,GEORGE,Allow me. Why?
S08E11,KRAMER,"Cage-free, farm-fresh eggs."
S08E11,JERRY,"Allow me. What are you, an idiot?"
S08E11,KRAMER,No (throws hand in the air and turns and looks back at Jerry)
S08E11,KURT,"Hold it, hold it, hold it, here, I got it. Catch. (Tosses his wallet to Elaine, she pays the delivery guy.)"
S08E11,ELAINE,"Hm. (looking at Kurt's driver's license photo) Hey, driver's license. Oh...my God."
S08E11,KURT,What?
S08E11,ELAINE,"Your hair. It's so thick and lustrous. I mean, it...it was."
S08E11,KURT,"Well, it still is. I shave my head for my swim team. I just liked the way it looked, so I kept it."
S08E11,ELAINE,Are you saying that I could be dating this hair? I mean wi..with you under it? (Kurt shrugs.)
S08E11,JERRY,(sits up in bed) Oh what...
S08E11,KRAMER,Hey.
S08E11,JERRY,"Is that your ""chicken"" making all that noise?"
S08E11,KRAMER,"Oh, Jerry loves the morning."
S08E11,JERRY,Who?
S08E11,KRAMER,Little Jerry Seinfeld. I named my chicken after you.
S08E11,JERRY,"Thanks, that's very sweet, but that is not, a chicken."
S08E11,KRAMER,Of course it is. I picked it out myself.
S08E11,JERRY,"Well, you picked out a rooster."
S08E11,KRAMER,"Well, that would explain Little Jerry's poor egg production."
S08E11,CELIA,This was fun.
S08E11,GEORGE,Yeah. I had a great time.
S08E11,GUARD,"Five minutes, Mr. Costanza."
S08E11,GEORGE,The whole hour just flew by. (laughs - hehe) (Begins cleaning up the table.)
S08E11,GUARD,I'll get that.
S08E11,GEORGE,"Oh, thanks, Bobby. (To Celia) Well, I guess I'll see you in four days."
S08E11,CELIA,Yeah. Go out and have a ball with the guys. I'll be waiting right here for you.
S08E11,GEORGE,Of course you will. (quick chuckle). You're the best. (with a light fist motion across her chin)
S08E11,CELIA,Hmm
S08E11,JERRY,Hello?
S08E11,HELEN (in Florida with Morty),Jerry? Leo told us he saw your bounced check. Are you having money problems?
S08E11,JERRY,I'm not having money problems.
S08E11,HELEN,"Enough with the comedy! You're very clever, you should look into advertising."
S08E11,MORTY,He never even called Ed Roydlick. They were looking for someone!
S08E11,JERRY,I'm not calling Ed Roydlick. I'm doing fine!
S08E11,HELEN,That's it. I'm gonna to send you fifty dollars.
S08E11,JERRY,You are NOT sending me fifty dollars!
S08E11,HELEN,"We're sending you fifty dollars! Morty, get me an envelope."
S08E11,JERRY (angrily),"I swear to God, if you send me fifty dollars, you are gonna be so sorry!"
S08E11,MORTY,I don't see envelopes!
S08E11,HELEN,"They're right in front of you! Oh, for heaven's sakes... (She puts the phone down on the couch and goes to help Morty.) Show you..."
S08E11,JERRY,"Ma! Ma! MAAA! (Hangs up the phone in disgust.) Oh, ahhhh (sighs quietly)"
S08E11,GEORGE,How're the folks?
S08E11,JERRY,Good.
S08E11,GEORGE,So? Movie tonight?
S08E11,JERRY,I thought you were going out with Celia?
S08E11,GEORGE,"I did. I'm back. I love this relationship, I feel so liberated!"
S08E11,JERRY,Having her in jail.
S08E11,GEORGE,The only thing that bothers me is that I'm just coming up with this now.
S08E11,JERRY,"Yeah, dating a convicted felon. I don't know how you missed it."
S08E11,ELAINE,Here. (Shows Kurt's driver's license to Jerry.) Take a look at that.
S08E11,JERRY,Huh. Kurt's an organ donor.
S08E11,ELAINE,No! He's not bald. Look! He's got a full head of hair.
S08E11,JERRY,So he just shaves his head for no reason?
S08E11,GEORGE,That's like using a wheelchair for the fun of it!
S08E11,ELAINE,And he's growing it in just for me. (Happily) It's mine. It's all mine. (clutches the photo between her hands and to her chest then looks at it again)
S08E11,JERRY,It's just hair.
S08E11,ELAINE,It's not just hair! Look!
S08E11,JERRY,It's brown.
S08E11,ELAINE,It's chestnut with auburn highlights!
S08E11,JERRY,So?
S08E11,ELAINE,You're not around women. You don't know how important a man's hair is.
S08E11,ELAINE,"I'm sorry, George, but it's true."
S08E11,GEORGE (close to tears),I knew it.
S08E11,MARCELINO,"Hey, Kramer."
S08E11,KRAMER,Yeah (quietly)
S08E11,MARCELINO,Nice rooster.
S08E11,KRAMER,Yeah (again quietly)
S08E11,MARCELINO,What's his name?
S08E11,KRAMER,"Ah, well, this is Little Jerry Seinfeld."
S08E11,MARCELINO,Little Jerry Seinfeld. Does he bounce checks? (laughs)
S08E11,KRAMER,"Look, can't you take Jerry's check down?"
S08E11,MARCELINO,"Sorry Kramer, can't help you."
S08E11,KRAMER,"Hey, hey Jerry, come on. Sorry."
S08E11,MARCELINO (impressed),I like the way he handles himself.
S08E11,KRAMER,Oh yeah (quietly)
S08E11,ELAINE,"Ohhh, it's coming in already!"
S08E11,KURT,Yeah (quietly)
S08E11,ELAINE,"Wow, you have some very nice little seedlings here. Huh..."
S08E11,KURT,What?
S08E11,ELAINE,"Well, it doesn't seem to be coming in so good over here. Or here."
S08E11,KURT,What do you mean? (Goes into the bedroom to look in the mirror.)
S08E11,ELAINE,"Well, I don't know... h- how long have you been shaving your head for?"
S08E11,KURT (from the bedroom),About three years.
S08E11,ELAINE,Huh.
S08E11,KURT,Oh my God! (Steps into the doorway) I'm going bald!
S08E11,CELIA,George! I'm so glad to see you!
S08E11,GEORGE,"Hey, I brought you some cigarettes. You buy yourself something nice."
S08E11,CELIA,Good news - I'm up for parole.
S08E11,GEORGE,Parole! (Feigning joy) That's dynamite!
S08E11,JERRY,So Marcelino's going to take down the check?
S08E11,KRAMER,"Yeah, Well, it comes down if Little Jerry Seinfeld wins the cockfight."
S08E11,JERRY,Great! (realizing) What?
S08E11,KRAMER,"Well, Marcelino, he has cockfights in the back of his store."
S08E11,JERRY,Ah ha...
S08E11,KRAMER,"Yeah, so he says if Little Jerry Seinfeld wins, the check comes down."
S08E11,JERRY,"Kramer, cockfighting is illegal."
S08E11,KRAMER,Only in The United States.
S08E11,JERRY,It's inhumane!
S08E11,KRAMER,"No, Jerry, it's not what you think it is."
S08E11,JERRY,It's two roosters peckin' at each other!
S08E11,KRAMER,What?
S08E11,JERRY,Yeah!
S08E11,KRAMER,"Well, I thought they wore gloves and helmets, you know, like ""American Gladiators."""
S08E11,JERRY,"No Kramer, Little Jerry could get hurt."
S08E11,KRAMER,"Yeah, well, I left him with Marcelino!"
S08E11,KRAMER,My Little Jerry! (Runs out.)
S08E11,JERRY,"Hey, did you get Little Jerry, is he O.K.?"
S08E11,KRAMER,"Oh well, he's more than O.K., he won!"
S08E11,JERRY,You let him fight?
S08E11,KRAMER,"Yeah, well I couldn't get there in time to stop it, but you should have seen Little Jerry, Jerry! Flappin' his wings and struttin' his stuff! He was peckin' and weavin' and bobbin' and talkin' trash! He didn't even have to touch him! The other rooster ran out of the ring. The whole fight lasted two seconds."
S08E11,JERRY,How long do they usually last?
S08E11,KRAMER,Five seconds. And Marcelino says he's taking your check down today.
S08E11,JERRY,Great!
S08E11,KRAMER,Hey.
S08E11,GEORGE,Celia's up for parole.
S08E11,KRAMER,"Hey, Little Jerry won his cockfight."
S08E11,GEORGE,What?
S08E11,KRAMER,Who?
S08E11,JERRY,I'm too tired.
S08E11,KRAMER (to Jerry),"O.K., listen, I want you to come by later, alright? 'Cause we're having a victory party for Little Jerry."
S08E11,JERRY,O.K. (Kramer leaves.)
S08E11,GEORGE (sadly),"It's over, Jerry. She's gettin' out."
S08E11,JERRY,"Ah, I'm so sorry."
S08E11,GEORGE,She's been locked up for two years. She's gonna want to make up for lost time. Dinners. Movies. (Rubs his forehead.) Talking...
S08E11,JERRY,"In other words, a normal relationship."
S08E11,GEORGE,"Heh, haa. And that's no good. I've tried it straight, Jerry. We've all seen the results. For me, sick is the only way to go."
S08E11,JERRY,"Well, she'll still be an ex-con."
S08E11,GEORGE,It's not the same.
S08E11,JERRY,"Hey, if you two are meant to be together...I'm sure the cops'll pick her up on something."
S08E11,ELAINE,Kurt? What's with the sweats? Aren't we going out?
S08E11,KURT,I don't care.
S08E11,ELAINE,"You, uh...got a big stain on your shirt."
S08E11,KURT,Oh yeah...meatball...fell out of my sandwich.
S08E11,ELAINE,You already ate?
S08E11,KURT,It's from yesterday.
S08E11,MARCELINO,Jerry! You missed a hell of a cockfight last night.
S08E11,JERRY,Then what is my check still doing up? We had a deal!
S08E11,MARCELINO,Now we have a new deal.
S08E11,JERRY,New deal?
S08E11,MARCELINO,"When Little Jerry Seinfeld is mine, the check will be yours."
S08E11,JERRY,This is Outrageous! (To Marcelino) Pack of Juicy Fruit.
S08E11,MARCELINO (tosses the gum on the counter),85 cents.
S08E11,JERRY,85 cents? That is Outrageous!
S08E11,JERRY,"Kramer, Marcelino wants us to sell him Little Jerry Seinfeld."
S08E11,KRAMER,"Well, that's out of the question."
S08E11,JERRY,"But Kramer, cockfighting is an illegal and immoral activity."
S08E11,KRAMER,"Yeah, if you got a loser. But Little Jerry was born to cockfight!"
S08E11,JERRY,"No, no more cockfighting. Let's just sell him to Marcelino the cockfighter and be done with it!"
S08E11,KRAMER,"You know, I think you're jealous."
S08E11,JERRY,Of what?
S08E11,KRAMER (points at Jerry like he's found him out),"Yah, yah! You see in Little Jerry Seinfeld the unlimited future you once had. Now, just because Jerry Seinfeld is a has-been, don't make Little Jerry Seinfeld a never-was!"
S08E11,JERRY,"Kramer, give me that rooster!"
S08E11,KRAMER,Never! You hate him because he's doing more with your name than you ever will! Yah-yah! (Kramer leaves.)
S08E11,BETSY,"George, Celia has listed you as a character reference. Whatever you can tell us would certainly be helpful in, her getting paroled."
S08E11,GEORGE,"Well, anything I can do to help, um...she's a wonderful girl. Very smart. Very eh...crafty."
S08E11,BETSY,Does she have any plans after she's released?
S08E11,GEORGE,"Plans. Schemes. She ah, she keeps talking about getting back together with her old friends, you know - ""the gang,"" as she likes to call them (chuckles), you know. Yeah, they're eh, they're hatching something, you can count on that."
S08E11,MARCELINO,Jerry! Tomorrow night's fight-night. Where's my rooster?
S08E11,JERRY,Kramer won't sell.
S08E11,MARCELINO,"Well, tell you what I'm gonna do. I'm gonna take down your check anyway."
S08E11,JERRY,"Oh well, thank you, Marcelino."
S08E11,MARCELINO,"Well, perhaps someday you will do me a favor. And that day is today. Little Jerry Seinfeld must go down in the third round of tomorrow's main event."
S08E11,JERRY,You want Little Jerry to take a dive?
S08E11,MARCELINO,"Shhh, not so loud."
S08E11,JERRY,"First of all, I don't think you can make a rooster take a dive."
S08E11,MARCELINO,"Can, too!"
S08E11,JERRY,"Second of all, Jerry Seinfeld - big or little - doesn't go down for anyone, anywhere, at anytime! Now I'd appreciate it if you please leave."
S08E11,MARCELINO (leaving),"Big Jerry is making a big mistake, Jerry."
S08E11,JERRY,"We'll see about that. (Runs to the window and shouts up to Kramer, who's on the roof.) Kramer, I'm comin' up! We got a cockfight to win!"
S08E11,KRAMER,O.K.!
S08E11,KURT,Elaine said you would be the best person I could talk to.
S08E11,GEORGE (examining Kurt's head with a lamp),Yep. Classic horseshoe pattern. I've seen a lot of this.
S08E11,KURT,"Oh, God."
S08E11,GEORGE,"No, no, Kurt - wrong attitude. You should be happy now."
S08E11,KURT,Happy? Why should I be happy?
S08E11,GEORGE,You've still got pretty good coverage. Once the enemy advances beyond this perimeter - (points at Kurt's head with a pen) - then you won't be Kurt anymore.
S08E11,KURT,Who will I be?
S08E11,KURT,How long do I have?
S08E11,GEORGE (solemnly),14 months. Maybe 10.
S08E11,KURT,Is there anything I can do?
S08E11,GEORGE,"Yes. Live, dammit. Live! Every precious moment as if this was the last year of your life. Because in many ways...it is. (There's a knock at the door.) Excuse me."
S08E11,GEORGE,Celia? W-w-what are you doing here?
S08E11,CELIA,"Well, I didn't get my parole, so I busted out."
S08E11,GEORGE (nervously),And-and you just decided to pop in...!
S08E11,ELAINE,Kurt!
S08E11,KURT,Elaine...(holds out a wedding ring) Will you marry me?
S08E11,KRAMER,"Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah. Boy he's lookin' good, huh Jerry?"
S08E11,JERRY,"Yeah. Alright, I think that's enough for today. (Kramer picks up Little Jerry and takes him to the sink.) Little Jerry is lean, mean, peckin' machine! (Kramer starts filling a pot with water.) What are you doing with that?"
S08E11,KRAMER,I'm just gonna heat this up. Make a little hot-tub for Little Jerry.
S08E11,JERRY,"Hey, Kramer...?"
S08E11,JERRY,Be careful.
S08E11,GEORGE,Hey.
S08E11,JERRY,"Hey, guess what! Little Jerry ran from here to Newman's in under thirty seconds!"
S08E11,GEORGE,Is that good?
S08E11,JERRY,I don't know. Where have you been?
S08E11,GEORGE,"Celia broke out of prison. I'm sitting in my home, she shows up at the door!"
S08E11,JERRY,Oh my God! The break-out/pop-in!
S08E11,GEORGE,"Yeah. Hey Jerry, listen to this. I discovered something even better than conjugal visit sex. Fugitive sex! Now, it's like everytime -"
S08E11,JERRY (interrupts),"George, this is a little too much for me - escaped convicts, fugitive sex...I got a cockfight to focus on. (Jerry leaves.)"
S08E11,ELAINE,"Hey hey Kurt, slow down! I can't just marry you, whim-bam-boom! I mean, I need some ""fiance-time,"" I need some ""make-my-girlfriends-jealous"" time..."
S08E11,KURT,"Plus, you want to get to know me."
S08E11,ELAINE,"Yeah, yeah, that too."
S08E11,KURT,"Well, how much time?"
S08E11,ELAINE,(sighs Wa-ah) I don't know...a year?
S08E11,KURT,"No, no, no...it has to be now."
S08E11,ELAINE,(sighs ahh) Could I see the ring again?
S08E11,JERRY (to Elaine),"So, you're actually considering it?"
S08E11,ELAINE,"Well, it'll be a couple of years before he's completely bald. Those'll be good times."
S08E11,JERRY,"Marriage is a big step, Elaine. Your life'll totally change."
S08E11,ELAINE,"Jerry, it's three-thirty in the morning. I'm at a cockfight. What am I clinging to?"
S08E11,GEORGE,"Oh, hey, sorry I'm late."
S08E11,JERRY,Hey.
S08E11,GEORGE,Sorry I'm late.
S08E11,JERRY,Where's Celia?
S08E11,GEORGE,"She didn't want to come, she-she's not really into sports."
S08E11,JERRY,hmm. (nodding head)
S08E11,JERRY,"Hey, how's he doin'?"
S08E11,KRAMER,"Ohh, He's got a big sweat going. (Takes an envelope out of his pocket.) Oh, this came for you express-mail. It's from your parents."
S08E11,JERRY (opens the envelope),Fifty dollars. I Don't Believe This!
S08E11,KRAMER,There's Marcelino. (Marcelino enters the ring holding a huge white rooster.)
S08E11,JERRY,Look at the size of his bird!
S08E11,KRAMER,That looks like a dog with a glove on his head.
S08E11,KURT,"Hi, is George back from the cockfight yet? You know, I gotta thank him, he changed my life."
S08E11,CELIA,"No, it must have been a good fight, he's not back yet."
S08E11,KURT,"Ah, damn."
S08E11,DETECTIVE #1 (to Kurt),"Sorry to bother you, Mr. Costanza. Well, well, well. Look who's here."
S08E11,CELIA,"Aw, man!"
S08E11,DETECTIVE #2 (to Kurt),"Mr. Costanza, you're under arrest for aiding and abetting a known fugitive."
S08E11,KURT (laughs),I'm not George Costanza.
S08E11,DETECTIVE #2,Save it. We know you're bald. We know it's you. Let's go! (They escort Kurt and Celia out.)
S08E11,ELAINE (to a woman at the fight),"Muchos gracias. (Turns back to Jerry and Kramer.) O.K., I got the whole scoop. Marcelino flew the bird in from Ecuador. He's 68 and 0!"
S08E11,JERRY,He's a ringer!
S08E11,GEORGE,Where's the tamale guy?
S08E11,KRAMER,Little Jerry's going to get his clock cleaned. I gotta get him outta there.
S08E11,KRAMER (lunging for Little Jerry),Lit _ tle Jer _ ry!
S08E11,JERRY,Kra _ mer!
S08E11,ELAINE,Stop _ the _ fight!
S08E11,GEORGE (holds up one finger),Ta _ mal _ e!
S08E11,KRAMER,"Ahhh, uh, uh, uh, ohuh, aaaa ouh au au au ah ah (more pecking) ah, ah, ah, Ah."
S08E11,ELAINE,Why? Why did you get into a fist fight with the cop? You were innocent!
S08E11,KURT,"They thought I was George. I'm not that bald. And I have too little time left to take that kind of crap, so I, slugged him."
S08E11,ELAINE,"So, how long are you gonna be in here for?"
S08E11,KURT,"Well, my lawyer says 14 months, but with good behavior, maybe...10?"
S08E11,ELAINE,(sighs) So 10 to 14 months.
S08E11,KURT,Yeah.
S08E12,KRAMER,"Well, that was alright, huh?"
S08E12,EMILY,Yeah.
S08E12,KRAMER,"Well, um, goodnight."
S08E12,EMILY,Goodnight.
S08E12,(Kramer rolls over to go to sleep. The bedside clock reads 12,30. Emily snuggles up to him and puts an arm around him. Kramer doesn't look comfortable with this.)
S08E12,(The clock reads 3,"31. Kramer is lying on his back, sleeping. Beside him, Emily lies face-down, sleeping, with her arms flung out wide. One hand is on the pillow above Kramer's head, then it moves and Emily's forearm runs across Kramer's face, waking him. Kramer looks disgruntled at being awakened.)"
S08E12,KRAMER,"(quietly, to himself) Look at this."
S08E12,(The clock reads 5,"11. A wide awake Kramer is right over to the edge of the bed, with Emily cuddled up to him, sleeping happily. Kramer tries to carefully move, so as to not wake Emily, but as he shifts his weight, he slips off the end of the mattress and falls to the floor. Emily rolls into the space vacated, continuing to sleep.)"
S08E12,HELEN,"Jerry, we can only stay four days."
S08E12,JERRY,"Well, I'm upset, but we'll make the most of it."
S08E12,MORTY,"Helen, did you pack my travel gym?"
S08E12,HELEN,"Yes. (to Jerry) Oh, your father bought a exercise device off the television. He does it every morning at four."
S08E12,MORTY,"Only twenty-five minutes a day, and you can attach it to any doorknob."
S08E12,JERRY,"Huh. So, I guess your travel miles are about to expire."
S08E12,HELEN,"Well, actually, Jerry, we wanted to talk to you about something."
S08E12,JERRY,Am I finally getting a baby brother?
S08E12,HELEN,"Jerry, be serious."
S08E12,MORTY,How would you feel if we sold the Cadillac?
S08E12,JERRY,What? The Cadillac I bought for you?
S08E12,MORTY,"It's too much car, Jerry."
S08E12,JERRY,"Aw, c'mon, you love that car. What about the Northstar system?"
S08E12,MORTY,I don't think we even use it.
S08E12,JERRY,"Well, it's a gift and I want you to keep it."
S08E12,HELEN,We already sold it.
S08E12,JERRY,Wh..why didn't you tell me before you sold it?
S08E12,MORTY,"Because we had a buyer, and we couldn't get a free flight until now."
S08E12,HELEN,"Well, we could, but we wanted the bulkhead."
S08E12,JERRY,(exasperated) Ugh.
S08E12,KRAMER,"(to Jerry) Man, that Emily is wearing me out."
S08E12,JERRY,Kramer.
S08E12,KRAMER,"No, no, no. It's not the sex, Jerry. (noticing Morty and Helen) Heyy! Seinfelds."
S08E12,HELEN,Hi Kramer.
S08E12,MORTY,Hiya Kramer.
S08E12,JERRY,We're in the middle of a discussion here.
S08E12,KRAMER,Oh yeah? What about?
S08E12,HELEN,Jerry's upset we sold the Cadillac.
S08E12,KRAMER,What'd you get for it?
S08E12,MORTY,Jack Klompus gave us six grand.
S08E12,JERRY,You sold my Cadillac to Jack Klompus?
S08E12,MORTY,(trying to press the cheque on Jerry) And we want you to have the money.
S08E12,JERRY,(getting worked up) I don't need the money.
S08E12,MORTY,What're you talking about? You had a cheque bounce at the bodega.
S08E12,JERRY,"(animated) Oh, is that what this is all about?! I bounce a cheque and you sold a Cadillac?!"
S08E12,HELEN,"Well, also, Jerry, we read an article in the Sun Sentinel. (digs in her purse and extracts a newspaper clipping) It says standup comedy is not what it used to be, what with def jam and all."
S08E12,KRAMER,"Yeah, that def jam is a force."
S08E12,HELEN,"Jerry, you know, I hear wonderful things about Bloomingdales' executive training program."
S08E12,JERRY,(sits on the back of the couch) Oh my god.
S08E12,KRAMER,"Y'know you've given this comedy thing your best shot. Yeah, you had some good observations, but it's over. Now, this Bloomingdale thing, that could be the next wave."
S08E12,GEORGE,"Uh, excuse me. Uh, pound of Arabian mocha java, please."
S08E12,ELAINE,"So, you understand how my Peterman stock options are gonna work?"
S08E12,GEORGE,I'm going to the bathroom.
S08E12,ELAINE,"Just, very interesting."
S08E12,JERRY,"Yeah, when it's your money, it's fascinating."
S08E12,COUNTERPERSON,Arabian mocha java?
S08E12,ELAINE,"(looks for George) Mmm. (can't see him) Oh, um, I got it."
S08E12,JERRY,That Arabian is strong coffee.
S08E12,ELAINE,It's PLO blend.
S08E12,ELAINE,"Ohh, I got your coffee."
S08E12,GEORGE,"Oh Oh, here, lemme uh..."
S08E12,ELAINE,"(waving away) Nah, nah, it's on me. (looks at her watch) Aww, man. Okay, listen guys, I'm gonna be late. (taking her cup of coffee) I'll see you, okay? (begins to walk away)"
S08E12,GEORGE,Yeah.
S08E12,ELAINE,Bye.
S08E12,GEORGE,Mmm.
S08E12,GEORGE,You see what just happened here?
S08E12,JERRY,What?
S08E12,GEORGE,She treated me to the Arabian mocha java.
S08E12,JERRY,And you misinterpret this how?
S08E12,GEORGE,She's stickin' it to me that she makes more money than me.
S08E12,JERRY,"I'm sure she was just being nice, buying you the coffee."
S08E12,GEORGE,"No, not nice. She's stickin' it to me."
S08E12,JERRY,You're crazy.
S08E12,GEORGE,"(worked up) Stickin' it to me, Jerry."
S08E12,JERRY,George.
S08E12,GEORGE,(angry) Stickin' it!
S08E12,GEORGE,So you're buying the car back for your parents?
S08E12,JERRY,I'm flying down to Florida tomorrow.
S08E12,GEORGE,Your parents'll never let you do it.
S08E12,JERRY,They lied to me about selling the car. I'll lie to them about buying it back. They think they can dump six grand on me? Think again.
S08E12,GEORGE,What kind of money you think your parents have?
S08E12,JERRY,Excuse me?
S08E12,GEORGE,I bet they have more money than mine.
S08E12,JERRY,"Come on, your parents have money."
S08E12,GEORGE,You think?
S08E12,JERRY,When did they ever spend any money?
S08E12,GEORGE,Never.
S08E12,JERRY,What are their living expenses?
S08E12,GEORGE,Nothing.
S08E12,JERRY,Where do they ever go on vacation?
S08E12,GEORGE,Nowhere.
S08E12,GEORGE,How much money d'you think they have?
S08E12,JERRY,Few hundred grand?
S08E12,GEORGE,"(excited) You're saying I stand to inherit three hundred thousand dollars, is that what you're saying?!"
S08E12,JERRY,Course you may not see it for twenty years.
S08E12,GEORGE,Twenty years? That long?
S08E12,JERRY,Does your father still eat bacon and eggs every day?
S08E12,GEORGE,"Fortunately, yes."
S08E12,JERRY,How's your family history?
S08E12,GEORGE,I have an aunt that died at seven.
S08E12,JERRY,Really?
S08E12,GEORGE,Aunt Baby.
S08E12,KRAMER,"Elaine. Uh, you got a moment?"
S08E12,ELAINE,"Yeah, Kramer, come on in."
S08E12,KRAMER,"I, uh, need to speak to you about some lady problems."
S08E12,ELAINE,(unsure) Oh-kay.
S08E12,KRAMER,"(a little anxious) You know, after I have sex with Emily, uh, I don't want her in the bed any more."
S08E12,ELAINE,Ah.
S08E12,KRAMER,"Yeah, because she's throwing off my whole sleep. She's got the jimmy legs."
S08E12,ELAINE,(confused) Jimmy legs?
S08E12,KRAMER,Jimmy leg.
S08E12,ELAINE,(grasping the concept) Ohh.
S08E12,KRAMER,"So, uh, well, maybe I should just be honest with her, huh?"
S08E12,ELAINE,"Tell her after sex, you just want her outta there?"
S08E12,KRAMER,"Well, I'd say it nicely."
S08E12,ELAINE,I don't think so.
S08E12,KRAMER,"Well, you know, I really like this girl and I, you know, I think if I could just work out this one thing..."
S08E12,ELAINE,(interrupting) Yeah. I gotta be honest with you Kramer. You might be more than just a coupla tweaks away from a healthy relationship.
S08E12,KRAMER,"Well you're not exactly zeroing in yourself, lady."
S08E12,ELAINE,"(pointing to the door, angry) Alright, get out."
S08E12,ELAINE,(impatient) Get out!
S08E12,JERRY,"So listen, I gotta go down to Atlantic City. I'm performing at Bally's."
S08E12,MORTY,You just heard about this today?
S08E12,JERRY,(pulling on a jacket) They had a cancellation and they instantly called me.
S08E12,HELEN,Who cancelled?
S08E12,JERRY,"Carrot Top. I told you, my career's fine."
S08E12,GEORGE,"I been, uh, thinking about the family. Tell me, uh, about Aunt Baby."
S08E12,FRANK,(looks up to heaven) She's deceased.
S08E12,GEORGE,"(glances upwards) Yeah. Uhm, why did she die so young?"
S08E12,FRANK,(looks to Estelle) She had problems. (Estelle nods) Internal.
S08E12,GEORGE,Is that common in our family?
S08E12,ESTELLE,"Well, your uncle Moe, he died a young man."
S08E12,FRANK,Also internal problems.
S08E12,ESTELLE,"It's that temper on your side. They're yelling and yelling, and then one day, they're all gone."
S08E12,FRANK,What about your side? Your cousin Hennie. (animated) She was sickly from the moment I met her!
S08E12,ESTELLE,(shouts) Don't you talk about Hennie!
S08E12,GEORGE,I guess you two are the lucky ones.
S08E12,FRANK,So far.
S08E12,ESTELLE,"Frank, if Aunt Baby were alive today, how old would she be?"
S08E12,FRANK,She'd never make it.
S08E12,EMILY,So let me get this straight. You enjoy the lovemaking...
S08E12,KRAMER,"Shh, shh."
S08E12,EMILY,"(quieter) Well, do you?"
S08E12,KRAMER,"Oh yeah, like strawberry pie."
S08E12,EMILY,"Okay, but you have a problem sharing a bed with me?"
S08E12,KRAMER,"I know it's not what the ladies like. But without some solid sack time, I'm a zombie."
S08E12,EMILY,I don't know.
S08E12,KRAMER,"(pleading) Aww, c'mon, man. Meet me halfway."
S08E12,EMILY,"You're not easy, Kramer."
S08E12,KRAMER,I know.
S08E12,JACK,"So, to what do I owe the pleasure of this, unannounced, visit?"
S08E12,JERRY,I wanna buy back the Cadillac.
S08E12,JACK,"You wanna buy it back? Why, you go drugs hidden in the trunk?"
S08E12,JACK,I'm kidding.
S08E12,JERRY,"(reaching into his pocket) Alright, I'll give you nine thousand for it."
S08E12,JACK,Nine thousand for a Cadillac? It's got no miles on it.
S08E12,JERRY,You bought it for six!
S08E12,JACK,You're not me.
S08E12,JERRY,(standing) How much d'you want for it?
S08E12,JACK,The Kelly blue book value. Twenty-two thousand dollars.
S08E12,JERRY,Fourteen thousand.
S08E12,JACK,"Done. But, I get to drive it tomorrow, because Doris wants to go to Naples."
S08E12,JACK,Need a pen?
S08E12,JACK,Still works.
S08E12,KRAMER,"Hey, where's Jerry?"
S08E12,HELEN,He's performing at Bally's in Atlantic City.
S08E12,KRAMER,"Aw, okay. (picks up the phone and starts dialling) Yeah, I need his shoeshine kit. (still dialling) He always hides it from me. (puts the phone to his ear and waits for a second or two) Yeah, Bally's? Yeah, Jerry Seinfeld's room, please."
S08E12,MORTY,You know that number?
S08E12,KRAMER,"I used to have a problem. (into phone) Well, what d'you mean, he's not registered? Wha..S, E, I, N, V..."
S08E12,HELEN,"F. F, E, L , D."
S08E12,KRAMER,"...F, E, L, D. (half-laughing) Well, I think you're wrong. (listens) Alright, you have a lucky day, too."
S08E12,HELEN,He's not there?
S08E12,KRAMER,"No, they never heard of him."
S08E12,ELAINE,"This is so nice of you to take us all out to dinner, George."
S08E12,GEORGE,"(oozing fake sincerity) Well, as much as I enjoy all the good-natured ribbing, nothing really makes me happier than spending money on the people I care about."
S08E12,HELEN,Where's Jerry?
S08E12,GEORGE,"Oh, he'll be here. By the way, Elaine, (reaches under the table and brings out a large coffee machine) thank you for laying out for the Arabian mocha java."
S08E12,ELAINE,"George, you didn't have to do this. I'm president of a big company. I can afford to buy you coffee."
S08E12,MORTY,(surprised) President?
S08E12,ELAINE,Yeah.
S08E12,GEORGE,"Hey look, he's back."
S08E12,JERRY,"I got your message, (sitting) so I came straight from Atlantic City."
S08E12,HELEN,"Jerry, Kramer called Bally's. You weren't registered."
S08E12,JERRY,"(extemporising) Well, I can't stay under my own name. I was registered under Slappy White."
S08E12,GEORGE,Mom? Dad?
S08E12,ESTELLE,"Well, look who's here. Hello, Seinfelds."
S08E12,GEORGE,Wh..what're you doing here?
S08E12,FRANK,We're having an upscale dinner.
S08E12,GEORGE,What?
S08E12,ESTELLE,"Well, after talking to you, we realised we may not have much time left."
S08E12,FRANK,"So, we're blowing it all."
S08E12,FRANK,"(holding out his tie) Look George, it's a Pierre Cardin."
S08E12,KRAMER,That was alright.
S08E12,EMILY,Yeah.
S08E12,KRAMER,"(abruptly) Well, I'll see you."
S08E12,JERRY,Hello.
S08E12,JACK,"(shouting like there's a bad line) Jerry, I had a little mishap with the car."
S08E12,JACK,I'm down here in alligator alley. You better get down here.
S08E12,JERRY,(quiet) Huh. Alright.
S08E12,HELEN,Who was that?
S08E12,JERRY,"(extemporising) That was the Golden Nugget. Also in Atlantic City. They heard such good things about my show at Bally's, they want me for tonight. So I'll have to repack, and go."
S08E12,MORTY,That didn't sound like the Golden Nugget.
S08E12,HELEN,I'm worried. What happens if we have to support Jerry?
S08E12,MORTY,I'd have to go back to work.
S08E12,HELEN,Where would you work?
S08E12,MORTY,Maybe I should talk to Elaine.
S08E12,ELAINE,"Well, Mr Seinfeld, I..I'm not sure I understand why you want a job here."
S08E12,MORTY,What's not to understand?
S08E12,ELAINE,"Well, for one thing, you live in Florida."
S08E12,MORTY,"I'm very comfortable working outta the house. I have a phone, we have a Kinko's nearby. You know, I think that my resume speaks for itself."
S08E12,ELAINE,(looking around her desk) Where is your resume?
S08E12,MORTY,I don't have it. I'll mail you one.
S08E12,ELAINE,"Alright, Mr Seinfeld, I... What kind of position did you have in mind?"
S08E12,MORTY,"You sell clothes here, don't you?"
S08E12,ELAINE,Yeah.
S08E12,MORTY,"Well, I sold raincoats in the garment centre for thirty-eight years. In nineteen forty-nine..."
S08E12,ELAINE,"(interrupting) Alright. Alright, alright. You come in tomorrow, we'll find something for you to do."
S08E12,MORTY,"You won't regret this, Miss Benes. What time should I be in? I get up at four, I could be here as early as four twenty-five."
S08E12,ELAINE,Uhm...
S08E12,PETERMAN,"(upbeat) Oh, Elaine, this dry air is curing me like a Black Forest ham."
S08E12,ELAINE,(stunned) Mr Peterman. You're back.
S08E12,MORTY,Who's Mr Fancy?
S08E12,KRAMER,"(hesitant) I uh, I was thinking maybe I should spend the night."
S08E12,EMILY,"Aww, that's sweet, but actually I, I think I'd prefer it if you left."
S08E12,KRAMER,(surprise) What?
S08E12,EMILY,You were completely right. I sleep so much better when I'm alone. (pause) And you scream in your sleep.
S08E12,KRAMER,I do?
S08E12,KRAMER,"(fearful) There was a man, he was trying to get into my apartment last night. He was jiggling the doorknob for twenty-five minutes."
S08E12,EMILY,"C'mon, it was probably the wind."
S08E12,KRAMER,"No, no, no. It was a fearless cat burglar. (pleading) Now listen, you gotta let me sleep here, huh? Y'know, I'll stay here on my side, and I'll stuff a sock in my mouth. (panicky) 'Cos I don't wanna sleep alone."
S08E12,EMILY,"(adamant) Well, I do."
S08E12,JACK,What took you so long?
S08E12,JERRY,I live in New York. (slams the cab door) What the hell happened?
S08E12,JACK,"This thing is a, is a behemoth."
S08E12,JERRY,What did you do?
S08E12,JACK,"I was, I was making a, a simple lane change. I, I put on the blinker and it took off on me. And the next thing you know, I was submerged. I'm telling you, Jerry, I'm very lucky that those crocs didn't get me."
S08E12,JERRY,"(exasperation) You are such an idiot. Well, we gotta get the car cleaned up for my parents."
S08E12,JACK,(shrugging) Do whatever you want. It's your car.
S08E12,JERRY,My car? You drove it into the swamp!
S08E12,JACK,"It drove itself into the swamp! Besides, I think I lost my pen, too."
S08E12,JERRY,"(smiling with pleasure) You know, that almost makes this all worthwhile."
S08E12,GEORGE,(pointing outside) Why is there a Cadillac parked in front of the house?
S08E12,FRANK,That's your mother's new car.
S08E12,GEORGE,You bought that?
S08E12,FRANK,It's a Coupe de Elegance.
S08E12,ESTELLE,"Your father wanted a Mercedes, but I won't ride in a German car."
S08E12,KRAMER,Mornin'.
S08E12,KRAMER,"Oh, boy."
S08E12,GEORGE,What the hell is going on here?
S08E12,KRAMER,"I had some trouble at my place, so I need a little company at night to sleep."
S08E12,ESTELLE,"George, your mother and I, and Kramer (holds Kramer's hand) have been talking."
S08E12,GEORGE,(dread) Oh god.
S08E12,KRAMER,"Uh, George, your parents can't blow through their savings in this community. It's low-rent. Now, we feel that Florida is really the place where they should be."
S08E12,FRANK,"(claps his hands) You can drop a grand in Disneyworld, like that."
S08E12,GEORGE,Wait a minute. (astonished) You're thinking of moving to Florida again?!
S08E12,ESTELLE,"Well, it's either that or we stay here, near you, and just sit on the money. What do you think we should do, Georgie?"
S08E12,PETERMAN,"So, anyway, effective immediately, Miss Benes will return to her old position, at her original salary..."
S08E12,PETERMAN,"...and I, of course, will return to mine. Kudos, Elaine, on a job... done."
S08E12,ELAINE,(hardly daring to ask) What about my stock options?
S08E12,PETERMAN,I think not.
S08E12,PETERMAN,"Now, down to business. (thoughtful) I have had this vision of a diaphanous rum-runner scarf."
S08E12,ELAINE,"Well, we could fly some fabric in from our silk factories, for about a thousand dollars a bolt."
S08E12,MORTY,"(shocked) A thousand?! I know a coupla Chinamen over there on Forty-third Street, who'll do it for half that."
S08E12,ELAINE,"(tactful) It's, ah, Asian-Americans."
S08E12,MORTY,What?
S08E12,PETERMAN,(puzzled) Who are you?
S08E12,ELAINE,"Don't worry, I..."
S08E12,MORTY,Morty Seinfeld. I cut velvet for forty years with Harry Altman.
S08E12,ELAINE,"Okay, Mr Seinfeld, this is not the t..."
S08E12,PETERMAN,"Elaine, did you hire this man?"
S08E12,ELAINE,"(worried) No, no. Well, I mean, you know, he's more like an intern, you know, at best."
S08E12,ELAINE,"So, if your parents move to Florida, you're poor."
S08E12,GEORGE,(pointing out the positive) But happy.
S08E12,ELAINE,"Obviously. And if they stay, you're rich, but..."
S08E12,GEORGE,Obviously.
S08E12,ELAINE,"Quite a dilemma. You know, I have a bit of a dilemma of my own."
S08E12,GEORGE,"No, no. No, no, no. (determined) We're staying on me. We haven't solved anything yet."
S08E12,ELAINE,"Alright, this is easy. Let 'em go."
S08E12,GEORGE,"What d'you mean, let 'em go? They're spending all my money."
S08E12,ELAINE,"Alright, well, then they stay. Lemma ask you something..."
S08E12,GEORGE,"(upset) Could you put a little thought into this? Jerry's gone, you could humour me. He humours me."
S08E12,ELAINE,"Speaking of Jerry, his father is driving me so crazy down at Peterman's."
S08E12,GEORGE,"You know what I do at the Yankees, when one of these old guys is breathing down my neck?"
S08E12,ELAINE,What?
S08E12,GEORGE,You schedule a late meeting.
S08E12,ELAINE,(puzzlement) Huh? What does that do?
S08E12,GEORGE,"These old guys, they're up at 4 a.m., by two thirty they're wiped. (animated) How did we get back onto you?!"
S08E12,ELAINE,(grabbing her bag and coat) I gotta split.
S08E12,GEORGE,"(shouted after Elaine) You know, I got nothing outta this!"
S08E12,KRAMER,"Hey Frank, you got two beds in here."
S08E12,FRANK,That's right. That's me on the left.
S08E12,KRAMER,"So, you sleep in separate beds."
S08E12,FRANK,"Thirty years ago, we came to an agreement. It was the only way I could get some rest."
S08E12,KRAMER,(intrigued) Really?
S08E12,FRANK,(confidential) Estelle's got the (jerks his elbow) jimmy arms.
S08E12,KRAMER,You can get that in your arms?
S08E12,FRANK,Like you wouldn't believe.
S08E12,JACK,"Jerry, it's getting late. You've cleaned up the car. You've made all your phone calls. Why are you still here?"
S08E12,JERRY,"Well, I uh, maxed out my credit cards, and I don't have enough cash for a hotel room. So..."
S08E12,JACK,"You are uh, thinking of staying here?"
S08E12,JERRY,Well...
S08E12,JACK,"(laughing) You've got some nerve. I almost break my neck in that death-trap of yours, and now you ask me for a favour!"
S08E12,JERRY,You didn't like that crack about the pen.
S08E12,JACK,I did not.
S08E12,GEORGE,"Well, I've given this a lot of thought, and I've gotta say..."
S08E12,GEORGE,"(attempting sincerity) As much as I'd like to see the two of you living it up in a warm, tropical, setting, I, I would just miss you too much. (smiling) So, I've decided, I want you to stay."
S08E12,FRANK,It's too late. We bought a condo at Del Boca Vista. We're leaving tonight.
S08E12,GEORGE,(crestfallen) But you said it was my call.
S08E12,ESTELLE,We were just being nice.
S08E12,ESTELLE,"(motherly concern) Cosmo, are you sure you're gonna be alright here alone?"
S08E12,KRAMER,"Oh, yeah, yeah. I got Emily coming over tonight."
S08E12,GEORGE,(animated) You're letting him have a woman over?!
S08E12,FRANK,"He's not family. It's different, psychologically."
S08E12,PETERMAN,"And so, I made an explosive out of chick peas, and I stopped that great rhino right in his tracks."
S08E12,MORTY,"Well, it's getting kinda late, why don't we uh..."
S08E12,ELAINE,"Mr Peterman, that can't have been the only time that you faced mortal danger."
S08E12,PETERMAN,"(smiles and laughs) Ha ha ha. Funny you should ask, Elaine."
S08E12,MORTY,"Look, if we're gonna stay here until all hours of the night, can we at least get some food here?"
S08E12,PETERMAN,"(looks at his watch) It's only five fifteen. So, later on that same day, I developed a great hankering for some wild honey..."
S08E12,MORTY,"(standing) Okay, I'm done. I'll be back in the morning, when he's close to finish with his story."
S08E12,PETERMAN,Morty. My stories are what sell these clothes.
S08E12,MORTY,"Cheap fabric, and dim lighting. That's how you move merchandise."
S08E12,PETERMAN,"(winks) Morty, you're out."
S08E12,MORTY,"(unconcerned) Ach, I never knew what the hell I was peddling with those stupid cartoons and that paper book, anyway."
S08E12,KRAMER,I don't know why I let you talk me into that corned beef at Snitzer's.
S08E12,EMILY,(not looking up from her book) No-one held a gun to your head.
S08E12,KRAMER,(dismissive) Yeah.
S08E12,EMILY,"(still reading) Don't forget, we're eating dinner at the Feinerman's tomorrow night."
S08E12,KRAMER,"(moody) Oh, why do I have to go? They're your friends."
S08E12,EMILY,You like 'em.
S08E12,KRAMER,I've had it with 'em.
S08E12,EMILY,Then we won't go.
S08E12,KRAMER,"(yielding) Okay, okay. What time?"
S08E12,EMILY,Eight thirty.
S08E12,KRAMER,(satisfied) Ahh. That was alright.
S08E12,ELAINE,"'One bright note in today's market, was the stock of retailer J Peterman, whose founder's surprise return generated a rise of twelve and a half points.'"
S08E12,JERRY,"Mmm-mmm-mmm. That means, if you still had those stock options..."
S08E12,ELAINE,(downcast) Yeah.
S08E12,GEORGE,(Jerry-style) That's a shame.
S08E12,ELAINE,"(sharp) What, are you sticking it to me?"
S08E12,GEORGE,(innocent) What?
S08E12,ELAINE,I think you're sticking it to me.
S08E12,JERRY,"Elaine, I'm sure George is just being sympathetic."
S08E12,ELAINE,(leaning forward and accusing) Stickin' it!
S08E12,JERRY,You're not alone. I'm practically broke.
S08E12,ELAINE,Really?
S08E12,JERRY,"No. But, I did blow over twenty thousand on that Cadillac."
S08E12,GEORGE,(relishing) Hmm-hmm-hmm-hmm. Delicious.
S08E12,JERRY,"Well, you seem happy."
S08E12,GEORGE,I am. The folks are twelve hundred miles away. (gleeful) I'm basking in the buffer zone. (looks for the waitress) 'Nother piece of pie here!
S08E12,ELAINE,"So, were your parents shocked to see the Cadillac?"
S08E12,JERRY,"Actually, I haven't heard from 'em yet."
S08E12,ELAINE,Hmm.
S08E12,MORTY,When are we gonna tell Jerry?
S08E12,HELEN,I don't wanna worry him. We'll tell him next time we go up.
S08E12,MORTY,He thought he could buy back that Cadillac for us? He's not getting away with that.
S08E12,HELEN,"Besides, that condo was too much house."
S08E12,ESTELLE,How many times can you check the car?
S08E12,FRANK,(coming away from the window) I saw a bum sleeping in a Cadillac the other day.
S08E12,ESTELLE,Why would someone break into a car to take a nap?
S08E12,FRANK,They don't nap. They make it their home. They urinate in there!
S08E12,ESTELLE,(shouts) You're driving me crazy!
S08E12,FRANK,"(standing) That's it, we're going back to Queens. (claps hands) Where's my hat?"
S08E12,ESTELLE,(shouts) Nooh!
S08E13,BILL,"Well, if the big man wants a new scoreboard, I don't wanna be the one to tell him no."
S08E13,REILLY,No-one in the park is gonna be able to see it from there.
S08E13,GEORGE,"(through a mouthful of shrimp) Well, why don't we just put a monitor in his skybox?"
S08E13,REILLY,"Hey George, the ocean called. They're running outta shrimp."
S08E13,GEORGE,"(angry, to himself) The ocean called. Running outta shrimp. Outta shrimp! (a thought occurs) Oh! Yes! That's what I shoulda said! (frustrated shout) Dammit!"
S08E13,JERRY,"'The ocean called, They're running outta shrimp'?"
S08E13,GEORGE,"Yeah, yeah, yeah. But then, I said to him, 'Oh yeah? Well, the jerk store called, and they're running outta you.'"
S08E13,JERRY,(smiling) Really? That's great. You said that to him?
S08E13,GEORGE,"(confessing) Well, actually, I thought it up on the way over here."
S08E13,JERRY,Oh. That's not quite the same.
S08E13,GEORGE,No. No it's not. You don't know this guy. It woulda been so sweet.
S08E13,JERRY,I'm gonna grab a can of balls.
S08E13,GEORGE,Right.
S08E13,MILOS,Hello. My name is Milos. How can I help you.
S08E13,JERRY,I need a can of balls.
S08E13,MILOS,"Can of balls for the nice guy, alri..."
S08E13,MILOS,"...Ahh. You don't plan to hit these balls with that racquet, do you?"
S08E13,KRAMER,"Checking out the staff picks, Miss Benes?"
S08E13,ELAINE,"Oh. (laughs) Ha-ha. Hey. Yeah, yeah. (indicating shelf) This Vincent guy, he is the best. He and I have the exact same taste in movies."
S08E13,KRAMER,"Oh, Vincent is an art-house goon. I stick to the Gene rack."
S08E13,ELAINE,"Gene? Oh, it's so stupid and mainstream."
S08E13,KRAMER,"(indicates 'Gene' shelf) I've seen all these, so I went with a Kramer pick."
S08E13,ELAINE,"(reading) 'The Other Side Of Darkness'. Huh, I never heard of that one."
S08E13,KRAMER,"Yeah, went straight to video."
S08E13,KRAMER,(positive) That makes me the premiere.
S08E13,ELAINE,(gets Kramer's point) Hah.
S08E13,KRAMER,"Jerry, have you ever seen the movie The Other Side Of Darkness?"
S08E13,JERRY,No.
S08E13,KRAMER,"It's about this woman, in a coma. Well, I couldn't finish watching it, so I want you to read this."
S08E13,JERRY,"(reading) 'I, Cosmo Kramer, having just seen the movie The Other Side Of Darkness, and not wanting to be in a coma like that lady in the movie, hereby want Jerry Seinfeld to remove my life support, feeding machine, lung-blower, etcetera, etcetera, etcetera.'"
S08E13,KRAMER,"Can you do that for me, buddy?"
S08E13,JERRY,"Well, I don't if what you have here constitutes a legally binding document."
S08E13,KRAMER,"Well, I'm gonna type it up."
S08E13,JERRY,"Yes, well, of course, but, even so, you may wanna talk to a lawyer."
S08E13,KRAMER,"Yeah, but, Jackie Chiles, he put a restraining order on me. (frustrated) I'm not allowed within two hundred feet of his office. I couldn't even give him his Christmas present."
S08E13,KRAMER,"Oh, hey, new racquet, huh?"
S08E13,JERRY,"Yeah. (hands racquet to Kramer) I wasn't gonna get it, but this guy Milos, who runs the pro shop, he really recommended it."
S08E13,JERRY,"In fact, it's the only racquet he plays with."
S08E13,KRAMER,"(picking up Jerry's old racquet) Well, you're not gonna need this any more."
S08E13,JERRY,"(accusingly) Hey, this is the zee page of my address book."
S08E13,KRAMER,"(explaining) Oh yeah, I put all your zees on the weights and measures page."
S08E13,ELAINE,"(emotional) Oh. Oh, bravo, Vincent. Bravo. (sniffs)"
S08E13,ELAINE,What?
S08E13,VINCENT (O.C.),Did you enjoy the movie?
S08E13,ELAINE,Who is it?
S08E13,VINCENT (O.C.),It's Vincent.
S08E13,ELAINE,Of Vincent's picks?
S08E13,VINCENT (O.C.),The same.
S08E13,JERRY,He called you?
S08E13,ELAINE,"He musta got my number off the computer. We ended up talking for, like, two hours."
S08E13,JERRY,To a guy you've never met? (mild sarcasm) Your screening process is getting ever more rigorous.
S08E13,ELAINE,Trying to meet him. He's never at the video store. They said he sets his own hours.
S08E13,PLAYER (O.C.),"Little help, hey!"
S08E13,ELAINE,(tossing the ball back) Yeah.
S08E13,PLAYER,Thank you.
S08E13,ELAINE,"(laughing to Jerry) Oh god, that guy's terrible."
S08E13,JERRY,(pulling on a jacket) Mmm-hmm.
S08E13,ELAINE,"Hey, how come we played at this crummy place instead of your club?"
S08E13,JERRY,George used up all my guest passes already.
S08E13,ELAINE,Ah.
S08E13,PLAYER,Ahh.
S08E13,JERRY,Come on.
S08E13,PLAYER,Thank you.
S08E13,JERRY,(tossing the ball) Here you go.
S08E13,JERRY,(disbelief) Milos?
S08E13,MILOS,"(shock) Oh, hey. (puts sunglasses back on) How you doing?"
S08E13,MILOS,"Okay, we should uh, wrap it up here."
S08E13,ELAINE,So he was bad. What d'you care?
S08E13,JERRY,"Elaine, I paid two hundred dollars for this racquet, because he said it's the only one he plays with. He could've played just as well with a log."
S08E13,KRAMER,"Hey. Right, I talked to this lawyer guy, Shellbach. Now, he's gonna set me up, but you gotta come with me and be the executor."
S08E13,ELAINE,The executor? Of what?
S08E13,JERRY,Kramer wants to die with dignity.
S08E13,ELAINE,There's a feather in your cap.
S08E13,KRAMER,"I don't wanna be a vegetable, Elaine. I just want out. (snaps fingers)"
S08E13,GEORGE,"Sometimes in life, the gods smile upon you, my friends."
S08E13,JERRY,D'you get someone to take that Canadian quarter?
S08E13,GEORGE,"I got another meeting with Reilly. A whole new audience, and I bet I can get him to try that line again."
S08E13,ELAINE,Who's Reilly?
S08E13,JERRY,"George was scarfing shrimp at this meeting, and this guy says 'Hey, George, the ocean called. They're running outta shrimp.'"
S08E13,GEORGE,Listen to the comeback. (pleased) 'Oh yeah? Well the jerk store called. They're running outta you.'
S08E13,GEORGE,(worked up) Wha...You gotta be kidding me?!
S08E13,ELAINE,"How 'bout this one? How 'bout, 'Your cranium called. It's got some space to rent.'?"
S08E13,GEORGE,(confused) What does that mean?
S08E13,JERRY,"(taps George's chest) Hey, here you go. 'Hey, Reilly. The zoo called. You're due back by six.'"
S08E13,GEORGE,"(frustrated) No. No, no, no. You're not helping me."
S08E13,KRAMER,"Look, just tell him you had sex with his wife. That'll kill him."
S08E13,GEORGE,(shouting) I'm not looking for another line. I got the line.
S08E13,KRAMER,"Look, George, just think about it. You know, you're married, how would you feel if somebody says to you that they just had se..."
S08E13,GEORGE,"(really animated) Alright, alright. You see? This is why I hate writing with a large group. Everybody has their own little opinions, and it all gets homogenised, and you lose the whole edge of it. I'm going with jerk store! Jerk store is the line! Jerk store! Yess!"
S08E13,KRAMER,(picking the racquet up) Did you take this out of the garbage?
S08E13,JERRY,"Yeah, it's still got some spring in the strings."
S08E13,KRAMER,"Oh, Jerry, this is a piece of junk. (drops racquet in the trash) How are you gonna be the executor of my living will?"
S08E13,KRAMER,(indicating) You see? You can't let go.
S08E13,JERRY,"Trust me, Kramer. Given the legal opportunity, I will kill you."
S08E13,KRAMER,"I wish I could believe you. Hey, Elaine, do you have some free time tomorrow afternoon?"
S08E13,ELAINE,Me?
S08E13,KRAMER,"Yeah, because you're perfect. You're a calculating, cold-hearted businesswoman. And when there's dirty work to be done, you don't mind stomping on a few throats."
S08E13,ELAINE,"(smiling, flattered) Oh, ho, c'mon."
S08E13,SHELLBACH,"Situation number four. You're breathing on your own, you're conscious, but with no muscular function."
S08E13,KRAMER,"Well, would I be able to communicate?"
S08E13,SHELLBACH,I don't see how.
S08E13,ELAINE,"Ach, I don't like the sound of this one."
S08E13,KRAMER,"Huhh, yeah, let's pull the cord."
S08E13,ELAINE,Yank it like (pops open soda can) you're starting a mower.
S08E13,SHELLBACH,"Moving on. You have liver, kidneys and gall bladder, but no central nervous system."
S08E13,KRAMER,"Well, I gotta have a central nervous system."
S08E13,SHELLBACH,"Okay. One lung, blind and you're eating through a tube."
S08E13,KRAMER,"Naw, that's not my style."
S08E13,ELAINE,Bore-ing.
S08E13,SHELLBACH,"Alright, you can eat. But machines do everything else."
S08E13,KRAMER,(hesitant) Uhm...
S08E13,ELAINE,I'd stick.
S08E13,KRAMER,"Yeah, yeah. Stick. (to Elaine) 'Cos I could still go to the coffee shop."
S08E13,ELAINE,(points to Kramer and smiles in agreement) That's right.
S08E13,JERRY,Hello Milos.
S08E13,MILOS,"Jerry, thank god you got my message. Thank you so much for coming down here. Uhm, listen..."
S08E13,JERRY,"(animated) You know, I spent two hundred dollars on a racquet because I thought you knew what you were talking about."
S08E13,MILOS,I..I...
S08E13,JERRY,You can't even play.
S08E13,MILOS,"Believe me, it is Milos great shame. But Jerry, I could lose my business if anybody find out. How would you like extra year membership of the club? Free. No charge."
S08E13,JERRY,You could do that?
S08E13,MILOS,"Jerry, for you, anything."
S08E13,JERRY,"(indicating the woman) Game, set and match, huh Milos?"
S08E13,MILOS,"(apologetic) Hah, Jerry, I am so sorry. they tell me there is no way they can do it. (meek) Is there anything else I can do for you? Anything at all. I refund your money."
S08E13,JERRY,"(animated) You know what Milos, I don't even care about the money. I just feel like I was taken by the worst tennis player I..."
S08E13,MILOS,Shhh-shhh. (whispers) I make it up to you.
S08E13,JERRY,"(doubtful) Yeah, you'll make it up to me."
S08E13,JERRY,"Tennis, anyone?"
S08E13,ELAINE,"Oh, this is the one Vincent told me about. The Pain And The Yearning. (reads from the box) 'An old woman experiences pain and yearning.' A hundred and ninety-two minutes?"
S08E13,KRAMER,"That's a lotta yearning, huh?"
S08E13,ELAINE,"You know, these movies are great, but they're just so emotionally exhausting."
S08E13,KRAMER,"Yeah, well, what you need is some summertime adolescent high jinx."
S08E13,ELAINE,Really?
S08E13,KRAMER,"(looking at 'Gene' rack) See what doctor Gene prescribes, huh? (pulls down a cassette) Oh, here, look at that. Weekend At Bernies Two. Now, that's an hilarious premise."
S08E13,ELAINE,(laughs) Huh. (looks from tape to tape) Well...
S08E13,KRAMER,Yeah. (taps the Weekend At Bernie's II box)
S08E13,ELAINE,"Yeah, I could use a chuckle."
S08E13,KRAMER,(approving) Yeah.
S08E13,ELAINE,What're you getting?
S08E13,KRAMER,"Nothing, I'm gonna finish watching The Other Side Of Darkness."
S08E13,ELAINE,Oh. How much you got left?
S08E13,KRAMER,"Yeah, about two hours."
S08E13,KRAMER,"Yeah, she shot in that coma pretty quick."
S08E13,ELAINE,"(at TV screen) Bernie is dead, you moron! (frustration) Just because he's wearing sunglasses he looks alive?! (picks up video box) Ugh, how long is this weekend, anyway? (reads from label) Ugh!"
S08E13,ELAINE,Hello.
S08E13,VINCENT (O.C.),(accusing) How's the movie. Elaine?
S08E13,ELAINE,Vincent?
S08E13,VINCENT (O.C.),(betrayed) The Gene pick. How could you? I thought we had something special.
S08E13,ELAINE,"(defensive) No, it doesn't mean anything. I'm not even gonna rewind it."
S08E13,ELAINE,Vincent?
S08E13,FRED,"Alright, let's get to it."
S08E13,GEORGE,"Wha..wait a minute, wha..what about Reilly?"
S08E13,FRED,Reilly doesn't work here any more.
S08E13,GEORGE,(surprise) What? I..I didn't hear about that.
S08E13,FRED,"Oh, we only wake you up for the important meetings."
S08E13,PATTY,Hello.
S08E13,JERRY,Hello. Didn't I see you at the pro shop yesterday?
S08E13,PATTY,I think so. I'm Patty. Milos gave me your address. I hope you don't mind me waiting for you here.
S08E13,JERRY,"(to himself) Hoh, that Milos. (to Patty) Well uh, what shall we do, uhm, care for a cup of coffee?"
S08E13,PATTY,Why don't we just go up to your apartment?
S08E13,JERRY,(surprised) Alright.
S08E13,JERRY,(to himself) Gotta be an easier way.
S08E13,NURSE (O.C.),"Doctor, how's her coma?"
S08E13,DOCTOR (O.C.),"Oh, exactly the same."
S08E13,DOCTOR (O.C.),"Wait a minute, she's coming out of the coma."
S08E13,DOCTOR (O.C.),"Mrs Allbright, can you hear me? Are you okay?"
S08E13,ALLBRIGHT (O.C.),(bright and cheerful) I feel so rested and refreshed. Get me a toothbrush.
S08E13,JERRY,"So, you play tennis?"
S08E13,PATTY,"(putting the glass down on the counter) Enough talk, Jerry."
S08E13,JERRY,"Not for me, I love chatting."
S08E13,PATTY,(putting her hand to Jerry's face) Shh.
S08E13,PATTY,"(anguished) No! No, I can't do this. (moving away) I can't go through with it. (sitting on the couch) Not even for him!"
S08E13,JERRY,Who?
S08E13,PATTY,(cries) Milos. My husband!
S08E13,JERRY,(shocked) Your husband?!
S08E13,GEORGE,"So concerned was he, that word of his poor tennis skills might leak out, he chose to offer you his wife as some sort of mediaeval sexual payola?"
S08E13,JERRY,(explanation) He's new around here.
S08E13,GEORGE,"(hopeful) So, details?"
S08E13,JERRY,"(walking away) Well, I didn't sleep with her."
S08E13,GEORGE,"Because of society, right?"
S08E13,JERRY,"(weary) Yes, George, because of society. So how did the big meeting turn out?"
S08E13,GEORGE,Reilly is no longer with the club. (getting up) You believe that?
S08E13,JERRY,"Ah, you're better off. Now you can just let it go."
S08E13,GEORGE,"Yeah, I'm gonna let it go."
S08E13,JERRY,"You never really had the right comeback, anyway."
S08E13,GEORGE,"(animated) Are you insane? Jerk store, woulda smoked that guy! Smoked him, I say."
S08E13,KRAMER,"Hey. Oh, Jerry, listen uh, you know, I saw the rest of that movie, The Other Side Of Darkness? The coma lady wakes up at the end."
S08E13,GEORGE,"(frustrated) Ohh, I wanted to see that. (waves his arms in frustration) Thanks. Thanks a lot."
S08E13,KRAMER,I didn't know it was possible to come out of a coma.
S08E13,JERRY,I didn't know it was possible not to know that.
S08E13,GEORGE (O.C.),(from bathroom) How was Eric Roberts as the husband?
S08E13,KRAMER,"(shouting back) Oh, unforgettable."
S08E13,GEORGE (O.C.),(disappointed) Oww.
S08E13,KRAMER,"(nervous) I gotta find Elaine. Y'know, she's gonna pull my plug."
S08E13,ELAINE,"What? Betrayed? Oh, Vincent, I'm so sorry. I..."
S08E13,KRAMER,"Yeah, listen, uh, Elaine, I've changed my mind about the whole coma thing. (positive) Yeah, I decided I'm up for it."
S08E13,ELAINE,"Kramer, do you have any idea what you've done?"
S08E13,MANAGER,Excuse me.
S08E13,ELAINE,What're you doing?
S08E13,ELAINE,Wha..wha...?
S08E13,MANAGER,Vincent stopped making picks.
S08E13,ELAINE,"(upset) Well, how am I gonna know what movies to see?"
S08E13,MANAGER,We have a wide variety of Gene picks.
S08E13,ELAINE,(dismissive) Gene's trash.
S08E13,MANAGER,I'm Gene.
S08E13,ELAINE,(forcing a smile) Hi.
S08E13,JERRY,"Milos, I can assure you, I had no intention of telling anyone about your unbelievably bad tennis playing."
S08E13,MILOS,"(not cheered) Thank you, but, unfortunately, I have much larger problems to fry. My wife, she has no respect for Milos anymore."
S08E13,JERRY,I guess that's a risk you run when you dabble in the flesh trade.
S08E13,MILOS,"Patty, she, she loves tennis, as much like I do. (hopeful) Wou..would you, wi..will you let me beat you in tennis? That is the only way I can show her I am still a man."
S08E13,JERRY,"(reluctant) Well, I'll do it as long as there's no other girls around. I mean, I wanna be a man too."
S08E13,JERRY,So you hurt Vincent's feelings?
S08E13,ELAINE,(handing Jerry an envelope) Look what came in the mail today.
S08E13,JERRY,(taking the envelope) Wh..What's this?
S08E13,ELAINE,"It's the play button, off his VCR."
S08E13,JERRY,"(examining the button) Boy, look how far back it goes. It's like a tooth."
S08E13,GEORGE,"(sitting) So, guess where Mr 'Ocean phoned' turned up? He's working for Firestone, in Akron, Ohio."
S08E13,ELAINE,Ohio?
S08E13,GEORGE,Yep. I'm leaving first thing tomorrow morning.
S08E13,JERRY,"(nonplused) You're flying to Akron, just to zing a guy?"
S08E13,GEORGE,"Don't you understand? It's not about him. To have a line as perfect as 'jerk store' and to never use it. I, I couldn't live with myself."
S08E13,ELAINE,"See, there are no jerk stores. It..it's just a little confusing, is all."
S08E13,GEORGE,"(adamant) It's smart. It's a smart line, and a smart crowd will appreciate it. (shouting) And, I'm not gonna dumb it down for some bonehead mass audience!"
S08E13,GEORGE,(waving apologetically) Not you.
S08E13,OLD WOMAN (O.C.),"Oh, brittle bones. How I long to be rid of the pain."
S08E13,ELAINE,Hello.
S08E13,VINCENT (O.C.),Elaine? It's Vincent.
S08E13,ELAINE,(surprised) Vincent. (pleading) Where are you? I have to meet you.
S08E13,VINCENT (O.C.),No. I can't bear to have anyone see me.
S08E13,ELAINE,"Vincent, listen, I won't judge you the way everyone else does. You're, you're strange and beautiful, and sensitive. (blunter) Now, let's have a look at you."
S08E13,VINCENT (O.C.),"(relenting) Alright, but, can you bring me few things from the store? I haven't been out in a while."
S08E13,KRAMER,"(indicating that cars should pass him) Well, go around, you bunch of crazies. You maniacs are gonna get us all killed."
S08E13,SECRETARY,"Hi, can I help you?"
S08E13,KRAMER,"Oh, yeah, yeah. I'm Cosmo Kramer. Yeah, I had an appointment to annul my living will."
S08E13,SECRETARY,"Oh. (looks at her watch) Mr Kramer, you had a ten-thirty appointment. It's two o'clock. Mr Shellbach had a tennis lesson. He's gone for the day."
S08E13,JERRY,Too good.
S08E13,MILOS,(triumphant shout) Another game for Milos!! Hahaha!
S08E13,JERRY,You're on fire today.
S08E13,MILOS,(shouting over) Hey Patty. look at this guy. He's awful!
S08E13,MILOS,"(milking it) He's not a man, this Jerry. He's not even married like I am. (laughs) Huhuhuhu."
S08E13,JERRY,"(quietly) Hey, uh, Milos, I don't mind rolling over here, but could you lighten up on the 'not a man' stuff?"
S08E13,MILOS,"(shouting) Hey everybody, look! The little chicken girl wants me to ease up. He can't handle this, so he cries like a woman! (laughs evilly) Hahaha!"
S08E13,ELAINE,Hello? Vincent?
S08E13,VINCENT,Elaine?
S08E13,ELAINE,I got what you asked.
S08E13,VINCENT,"Just, leave it and go."
S08E13,ELAINE,"W..well, can't I come in?"
S08E13,VINCENT,No. Go away. Now.
S08E13,ELAINE,"(pleading) No, no. Vincent, I... Don't shut me out. (beseeching) I just, I know you feel what I feel."
S08E13,WOMAN,Excuse me. Can I help you?
S08E13,VINCENT,"Aw, dammit!"
S08E13,ELAINE,"(confused) Uh, uhm, I'm, I'm here to see Vincent."
S08E13,WOMAN,"Well, I'm his mother. (stern) Vincent, what's going on here?"
S08E13,VINCENT,"(shrieks) No, my acne!"
S08E13,ELAINE,Ahh-cnee.
S08E13,WOMAN,(regarding the grocery bag) What d'you have here?
S08E13,WOMAN,"(disapproving) Vodka, cigarettes, fireworks. (accusing) What kind of a sick woman brings this to a fifteen year old?"
S08E13,ELAINE,(sick smile) We have the same taste in movies.
S08E13,WOMAN,Did he send you part of our VCR?
S08E13,ELAINE,Yeah.
S08E13,WOMAN,(entering the apartment) Vincent!
S08E13,MILOS,"(pointing and shouting) Look at the big baby! (laughter) Hehaha. (to Jerry) Hey, big baby, are you wetting yourself? Maybe it is time for you to be changed. (laughter) Hahah."
S08E13,JERRY,(quietly) I told you to cut it out.
S08E13,MILOS,"(quietly, to Jerry) Hey, c'mon, what're you doing? (to his audience)"
S08E13,KRAMER,(waving) Shellbach.
S08E13,KRAMER,Racquet.
S08E13,REILLY,"So, George. You're proposing a snow tyre day at Yankee Stadium?"
S08E13,GEORGE,"(through a mouthful) Long as they don't throw 'em on the field. (laughs) Huhu. (indicating dish) Help yourself to some shrimp, I brought enough for everybody."
S08E13,MCADAM,"(doubtful) I have to say this, this proposal doesn't make a whole lot of sense."
S08E13,GEORGE,"Well, you never know. (picks up more shrimp) Let's see how many I can fit in my mouth."
S08E13,REILLY,"(leaning forward) You know, George..."
S08E13,REILLY,The ocean called. They're running outta shrimp.
S08E13,GEORGE,"(standing) Oh yeah, Reilly? (smugly) Well, the jerk store called. They're running outta you"
S08E13,REILLY,(unperturbed) What's the difference? You're their all-time best seller!
S08E13,GEORGE,"Yeah? Well, I had sex with your wife."
S08E13,MCADAM,His wife is in a coma.
S08E13,ELAINE,(to Jerry) Hi. (indicating Kramer) How's he doing?
S08E13,JERRY,He's been sleeping a lot. He's still groggy.
S08E13,ELAINE,Oh. (puts the VCR down) I thought a movie might cheer him up. I got him a Gene pick.
S08E13,JERRY,What happened to Vincent?
S08E13,ELAINE,"(evasive) I'm kinda off of him. (looking around) Uh, outlet?"
S08E13,ELAINE,Ah.
S08E13,KRAMER,(screaming) Waahhh!!!
S08E13,GEORGE,"'My wife's in a coma.' Yeah? Well, the life support machine called and..."
S08E13,GEORGE,(shouts) Wait! Yes! That's what I should've said! (frustration) D'ohh!
S08E13,GEORGE,"(cocky laughter) Huh haha! (shouts) You're meat, Reilly! You just screwed yourself! (laughter) Ha ha!"
S08E14,[Setting,A Restaurant]
S08E14,ELLEN,"So, they have this clock now, where you punch in your age, and all your risk factors. It actually counts down how much time you have left to live."
S08E14,JERRY,"So what's the great moment? You're on your death bed, they're pounding on your chest - and you're going 10, 9, 8,.. I told you this thing was good!"
S08E14,ELLEN,(Laughs) I can't believe this is our first date.
S08E14,JERRY,I know.. How about dessert?
S08E14,ELLEN,I suppose I have to get a piece of cake..
S08E14,JERRY,Why?
S08E14,ELLEN,Today's my birthday.
S08E14,JERRY,What? Today? Really?
S08E14,ELLEN,Yeah.
S08E14,[Setting,Jerry's apartment]
S08E14,GEORGE,"So, she went out with you on a first date.. and it was her birthday?"
S08E14,JERRY,Yeah. And she picked the day!
S08E14,GEORGE,Is she socially awkward?
S08E14,JERRY,"No, she's great! She's.. attractive, she's fun.."
S08E14,GEORGE,"Well, maybe she decided to celebrate her birthday on the Monday after the weekend."
S08E14,JERRY,She's not Lincoln.
S08E14,KRAMER,Hey! Anybody up for Lorenzo's pizza?
S08E14,JERRY,I'll pass.
S08E14,KRAMER,"Oh, yeah? Huh. (Turns to George) Hey, George! Pizza? Yum, yum!"
S08E14,GEORGE,"Eh, I can't. I gotta go down to the foundation. I'm interviewing high schoolers for the Susan Ross.. scholarship."
S08E14,JERRY,Does it ever bother you that this organization-
S08E14,GEORGE,Nope!
S08E14,JERRY,is beating the bushes-
S08E14,GEORGE,Nope! (Starts heading for the door)
S08E14,JERRY,to basically give this money away-
S08E14,GEORGE,Noo!
S08E14,JERRY,"to virtually anyone, as long as they're not you?"

S08E14,STUDENT 1,And then I received a 740 on the English achievement test. (George looks bored)
S08E14,GEORGE,"Quick, what's your favorite animal?"
S08E14,STUDENT 1,I.. I don't know.. frog?
S08E14,GEORGE,(Disappointed) A frog?
S08E14,STUDENT 1,"Well, I.. I.."
S08E14,GEORGE,(Annoyed) Frog is wrong.
S08E14,GEORGE,"(Reading) I see here that you play the harp.. tell me, why do you have to tilt it? Can't you just build it on an angle? It'd save you a lot of trouble."
S08E14,STUDENT 2,"Well, the modern-day harp has been refined over thousands of years-"
S08E14,GEORGE,"(Annoyed) Yeah, yeah. We'll, uh, let you know."
S08E14,GEORGE,(Reading) I see your G.P.A's a 4.0.
S08E14,STUDENT 3,"(Smiling gloatingly) You like that, don't you?"
S08E14,GEORGE,"so, uh, Steven.. I see you're president of the chess club."
S08E14,STEVEN,State champs.
S08E14,GEORGE,Who's your favorite chess player?
S08E14,STEVEN,"(Hesitating, he mumbles) Nastercoff?"
S08E14,GEORGE,"Right. (Mumbles) Nastercoff.. What country is he from, again?"
S08E14,STEVEN,(Sighs) I don't know.. I made it up. (Gets up to leave) I'm never gonna get this thing.
S08E14,GEORGE,"(Gets up, stopping him) Woah, woah, woah! What are you telling me for? You really had me going, there! C'mon, sit down. (They both sit back down) What do you want to do when you grow up?"
S08E14,STEVEN,I've been telling people that I'd like to be an architect..
S08E14,[Setting,Jerry's apartment]
S08E14,ELAINE,"So, get this Mister Peterman is finally letting me do some real writing. He's got this book deal, for his autobiography. He's gonna let me ghost write it."
S08E14,JERRY,"Wow. That's great! When it comes out, I'll have to get someone to ghost read it."
S08E14,KRAMER,Hey.
S08E14,JERRY,Hey.
S08E14,ELAINE,Hey!
S08E14,KRAMER,"Alright, so there I am at Lorenzo's - loading up my slice of the fixin's bar.. garlic, (imitates the shaking of garlic onto a pizza) and what-not.. mmm, mmm.. and I see this guy over at the pizza boxes giving me the stink-eye. (Imitates the 'stink-eye') So I give hime the crook-eye back, (Imitates the 'crook-eye') you know.. Then, I notice that he's not alone! I'm taking on the entire Van Buren Boys!"
S08E14,JERRY,The Van Buren Boys? There's a street gang named after President Martin Van Buren?
S08E14,KRAMER,"Oh yeah, and they're just as mean as he was! So, I make a move to the door, you know, (makes a noise) they block it! So, I lunged for the bathroom. (demonstrates) I grab the knob - Occupado! Then they back me up agains the cartoon map of Italy, and all of the sudden, they just stop."
S08E14,ELAINE,What? What happened?
S08E14,KRAMER,"Because I'm still holding the garlic shaker.. Yeah.. like this (grabs Jerry's peper shaker, and demonstrates) I'm only showing eight fingers."
S08E14,JERRY,"Well, what does that mean?"
S08E14,KRAMER,"That's their secret sign! See, Van Buren, he was teh eighth President.. (Holds up 8 fingers) They thought I was a former Van B. Boy!"

S08E14,ELLEN,"(Sees a pay phone) Oh, Jerry, can you hold on a sec? I just want to check my messages.. (She meets up with two of her friends on the way to the phone) Oh, Melissa! Kim!"
S08E14,MELISSA,Ellen.
S08E14,ELLEN,"Hey! You guys, I want you to meet Jerry. (Gestures tward Jerry, then goes back to the phone)"
S08E14,MELISSA,"Ohh, we've heard a lot about you! (Confidentially) It is so sweet of you to take her out."
S08E14,KIM,"Yeah, you don't even know how much she needs this."
S08E14,JERRY,(Sympathetically) She coming of a bad break-up?
S08E14,KIM,(Casually) No.
S08E14,MELISSA,See ya!
S08E14,JERRY,Any messages?
S08E14,ELLEN,"Yeah, no one called."
S08E14,[Setting,Coffee shop]
S08E14,JERRY,They act like it was some act of charity. Just going out with her.
S08E14,GEORGE,"So, she's the loser of the group. Every group has someone that they all make fun of.. Like us with Elaine. (Jerry thinks about this, then shakes it off)"
S08E14,JERRY,There is no way Ellen is the loser of that group.
S08E14,GEORGE,Are you looking deep down at the real person underneath?
S08E14,JERRY,"No, I'm being as superficial as I possibly can!"
S08E14,GEORGE,"(Changing subject) Hey, I htink I may have found someone for the scholarship."
S08E14,JERRY,Yeah?
S08E14,GEORGE,"I'm interviewing all these annoying little overachievers.. finally, this kid walks in - Steven Koren - a regular guy.. likes sports.. watches T.V.."
S08E14,JERRY,Is he smart?
S08E14,GEORGE,(Defensively) He knows how to read. And he also knows finishing an entire book doesn't prove anything. And get this he's into architecture.
S08E14,JERRY,Hey! Just like you pretend to be.
S08E14,GEORGE,"Yes. With a little guidance, Steven Koren is going to be everything I claim to be, only for real. That's my dream, Jerry."
S08E14,JERRY,I had a dream last night that a hamburger was eating me!
S08E14,[Setting,J. Peterman's apartment]
S08E14,ELAINE,"Mister Peterman, thanks for having me over. Your place isn't quite what I imagined.. (It's plain, with no sign of Peterman's personality)"
S08E14,PETERMAN,Ohhh.. It's just a place to flop. (Sits in his recliner)
S08E14,ELAINE,"Well, (Clears throat) what part of your life (hits the record button on a mini-recorder, and sets it down on the table) do you want to start with? Foreign intrigue? Exotic romances?"
S08E14,PETERMAN,"Oh, Elaine, we've covered all of that in the catalogue ad nauseum. No, I would like this book to be about my day-to-day life."
S08E14,ELAINE,Oh.
S08E14,PETERMAN,"(Turns on the T.V, and starts flipping through the channels) Oh damn. They changed the cable stations again.. just when I finally memorized them."
S08E14,ELAINE,"Well, Mister Peterman, do you want to, um.."
S08E14,PETERMAN,(Still flipping through the channels) 2.. CBS..
S08E14,ELAINE,"get, um, started.."
S08E14,PETERMAN,3.. I don't know what that is.. where's my damn preview channel?
S08E14,ELAINE,"(After observing Peterman's home life) Well, I - I got ta tell you, Mister Peterman.. I don't think I see a whole book here."
S08E14,PETERMAN,"well, I'm sure we'll come up with something. What do you say you and I order ourselves a pie? Do you like Lorenzo's?"
S08E14,ELAINE,"You know, a friend of mine almost got beat up at that place by the Van Buren Boys?"
S08E14,PETERMAN,(Interested) You don't say.
S08E14,ELAINE,Yeah. The only think that saved him is that he accidentally flashed their secret gang sign.
S08E14,PETERMAN,"Well, that's pretty exciting. (Pause) Let's put that in the book."
S08E14,ELAINE,"But, that didn't happen to you."
S08E14,PETERMAN,"So, we pay off your friend, and it becomes a Peterman."
S08E14,ELAINE,"No, I - I really don't think you can do that."
S08E14,PETERMAN,"(Looking at his dying plant) Ohh, damn. I forgot to buy plant food again.. I'll bet I got a coupon for it. (Starts looking through a small coupon box)"
S08E14,ELAINE,You know what? Maybe I better talk to my friend.
S08E14,[Setting,Coffee shop]
S08E14,JERRY,Is that the same outfit you were wearing yesterday?
S08E14,ELLEN,"No, this is brand new. Do you like it?"
S08E14,JERRY,"Actually, yeah. (Pause) Wait a second! Is that the fork that fell on the floor?! (Dramatically) Are you using the fork that fell on the floor?!"
S08E14,ELLEN,"(Laughs) No, Jerry, the waitress game be another one."
S08E14,JERRY,I guess that's all right.
S08E14,ELLEN,"Is something wrong, Jerry?"
S08E14,JERRY,"No, absolutely nothing. (They get up to leave) You're fantastic! (They meet up with Kramer and George on the way out) Hey guys!"
S08E14,GEORGE,Hey.
S08E14,JERRY,"(Gesturing to Ellen) Kramer, George, this is Ellen."
S08E14,[Setting,Susan Ross Foundation conference room]
S08E14,GEORGE,"Ladies and gentlemen, this (Opens the door, Steven is standing there) is Steven Koren. His G.P.A. is a solid 2.0! Right in that meaty part of the curve - not showing off, not falling behind."
S08E14,WYCK,"George, the quailifications for this scholarship were suppose to be.. largely academic."
S08E14,GEORGE,I'm sure we're all aware of the flaws and biases of standardized tests..
S08E14,WYCK,These aren't standardized tests - these are his grades.
S08E14,GEORGE,"Besides, Steven Koren has the highest of aspirations. He wants to be (pauses for effect) an architect."
S08E14,WYCK,Is that right?
S08E14,STEVEN,"Actually, maybe I could set my sights a little bit higher."
S08E14,GEORGE,"(Laughs) Steven, nothing is higher than an architect."
S08E14,STEVEN,"I think I'd really like to be a city planner. (Sits down, addressing the entire foundation board) Why limit myself to just one building, when I can design a whole city?"
S08E14,WYCK,"Well, that's a good point."
S08E14,GEORGE,"(Mutters) No, it's not."
S08E14,STEVEN,"Well, isn't an architect just an art school drop-out with a tilty desk, and a big ruler? (Laughs - so do the board members)"
S08E14,GEORGE,(Irritated) It's called a T-square.
S08E14,WYCK,"You know, the stupidest guy in my fraternity became an architect - after he flunked out of dental school! (Everyone but George laughs) Contratulations, young man. (Shakes Steven's hand)"
S08E14,STEVEN,Thank you.
S08E14,WYCK,Susan would be proud of what you're doing.
S08E14,STEVEN,Thank you.

S08E14,KRAMER,"You know, if you like that one, I got more.. what are you looking for? Romance? Comedy? Adventue? .. Erotica? (Clicks his tongue)"
S08E14,ELAINE,"No, uh, Kramer. I don't think -"
S08E14,PETERMAN,(Interrupting) How much would you take for the whole lot?
S08E14,KRAMER,My whole lot?
S08E14,PETERMAN,"Name your price, man!"
S08E14,KRAMER,(Thinks) 1500 dollars.
S08E14,PETERMAN,I'll give you half that.
S08E14,KRAMER,(Excited) Done!
S08E14,PETERMAN,"Kramer, my friend, (Gestures to Elaine) consider Elaine at your disposal."
S08E14,KRAMER,"Okay.. (To Elaine) Well, I, Uh.. I like to work in the evenings.. (Elaine slumps back, and covers her head in misfortune)"
S08E14,[Setting,Elaine's office]
S08E14,ELAINE,Would you please just get on with the stupid Bob Saccamano story?!
S08E14,KRAMER,"Well, I'm on the phone with Bob, and I realize right then and there that I need to return this pair of pants. So, I'm off to the store."
S08E14,ELAINE,What happened to Bob Saccamano?
S08E14,KRAMER,"Well, nothing. His part of the story is done. (Elaine covers her face with her hands - showing her difficulty coping with Kramer) So I'm waiting for the subway, It's not coming, so I decided to hoof it through the tunnel."
S08E14,ELAINE,"Alright, well, now that's something.."
S08E14,KRAMER,"Well, I don't know if I lost track of time - or what, but the next think I knew.."
S08E14,ELAINE,(Adding) A train is bearing down on you?!
S08E14,KRAMER,"No, I slipped - and fell in the mud. Ruining the very pants I was about to return."
S08E14,ELAINE,(Reflects on the story) I don't understand.. you were wearing the pants you were returning?
S08E14,KRAMER,"Well, I guess I was.."
S08E14,ELAINE,(Still confused) What were you gonna wear on the way back?
S08E14,KRAMER,"Elaine, are you listening?! I didn't even get there! (Pauses) All right, next story.."
S08E14,ELAINE,"Alright, I think I got enough for one day."

He gets up, goes go Kramer's door, and knocks. They talk) Four days at a beautiful bed-and-breakfast! I can't wait.. buy-bye. (Hangs up. George and Kramer come into Jerry's apartment, confronting him) What? (George takes the phone off the hook) What is this?"

S08E14,PETERMAN,"It just seems so cliched, and obvious. It's not interesting writing."
S08E14,ELAINE,"Yeah.. yeah. I know. Um.. how about if, instead of.. diving from the train, you.. uh, you, I don't know, you slip and, and fall in some mud, and.. ruin your pants?"

S08E15,KRAMER,Look how dark it's gettin' already.
S08E15,JERRY,"Well, it's not Daylight Savings Time yet."
S08E15,KRAMER,When does it start?
S08E15,JERRY,"(pause) I don't know, they just tell you the night before."
S08E15,KRAMER,"Uh. Well, I'm sick o' waiting. (pulls out his pocket-watch (it has a chain, too)) I am springin' ahead riiight now."
S08E15,JERRY,"(under breath) Oh, I'm sure that won't cause any problems.."
S08E15,JERRY,"Oh, god, it's Mike Moffit.."
S08E15,KRAMER,"Oh now, don't tell me you're still mad at him for calling you a phony. Jerry, that was five years ago!"
S08E15,JERRY,I'm not a phony an' I don't want anything to do with this guy.
S08E15,KRAMER,Hey! Mike!
S08E15,MIKE,"(sees and is enthused, coming over) Kramer! Jerry! How's it goin'?!"
S08E15,JERRY,Fine. An' I'm not just sayin' that..
S08E15,MIKE,Guess what? I just started my own business. I'm a bookie!
S08E15,JERRY,No openings in arson?
S08E15,MIKE,"(pauses, struck by J's attitude) Either of you guys wanna place a bet I'm your guy."
S08E15,KRAMER,"(quickly) Ah no no no. No bets for me, I uh, I got a disease."
S08E15,JERRY,I'm feelin' a bit queasy myself. Maybe I'll see you in another five years. (casually leaves)
S08E15,MIKE,"Kramer. Jerry still mad about that ""phony"" thing?"
S08E15,KRAMER,You kidding? It's all water near a bridge.
S08E15,MIKE,"Hey, what time you got?"
S08E15,KRAMER,(pulling out his timepiece) Oh yes. Uh.. it's aaalmost six.
S08E15,MIKE,Whoa--uh--I'm really late. (leaves)
S08E15,ELAINE,"Oh! These designs look great! Peggy, you really saved me."
S08E15,PEGGY,"Oh, it was no problem."
S08E15,ELAINE,(leaving with the drawings) Mr. Peterman is gonna love 'em.
S08E15,PEGGY,"(focusing on her work) Thanks, Susie."
S08E15,ELAINE,"You won't believe this but, as I'm leaving, she calls me ""Susie."""
S08E15,JERRY,I don't see you as a Susie. Sharon maybe.
S08E15,ELAINE,"What am I, a--a bulimic, chain-smoking, stenographer from Staten Island?"
S08E15,JERRY,Who are you describing?
S08E15,ELAINE,Someone I know.
S08E15,JERRY,Named Sharon?
S08E15,ELAINE,I'd rather not say.
S08E15,GEORGE,Hey.
S08E15,ELAINE,(to say hello) Mmm! What's in the bag?
S08E15,GEORGE,"(sitting) Newww tuxedo. For the Pinstripe Ball. Steinbrenner is throwing a huge party at Tavern on the Green, heh!"
S08E15,JERRY,Kind of a Yankee prom?
S08E15,GEORGE,(resentfully dampened) It's not a prom. It's a Ball.
S08E15,JERRY,You taking Allison?
S08E15,GEORGE,"Yes, of course I'm taking Allison. This woman is genetically engineered to go to a ball. Tall, blonde, lithe--"
S08E15,JERRY,Live?
S08E15,ELAINE,Lithe.
S08E15,GEORGE,Live?
S08E15,ELAINE,(rolling her eyes) Lithe!
S08E15,JERRY,"Oh, lithe!"
S08E15,ELAINE,"Well, you two'll have a great time there."
S08E15,JERRY,It can't be worse than this.
S08E15,ELAINE,Mmm!
S08E15,GEORGE,An' wait'll you see the dress that she's got. It's backless! Uh?! I'm finally gonna make a Great Entrance!
S08E15,ELAINE,Backless? Ya gonna back her in?
S08E15,GEORGE,"Elaine, when a woman makes a Ball Entrance.. she twirls."
S08E15,ELAINE,She's not gonna twirl--
S08E15,GEORGE,She'll Twirl.
S08E15,GEORGE,"That is what Mr. Steinbrenner wants. He wants, everyone, ta, twirl around."
S08E15,ALLISON,(weary) All right.
S08E15,GEORGE,"Hey! Uh--listen--did you get your--uh--boss's Knick ticket, for Kramer?"
S08E15,ALLISON,"(digging in purse) Yeah, uh--here. (hands him ticket)"
S08E15,GEORGE,Oh! Great!
S08E15,ALLISON,"Uh. Say, George--"
S08E15,GEORGE,Woo! Courtside! (mock-snide) Is that the best you could do? Ha ha!
S08E15,ALLISON,(sitting) George. We need to talk.
S08E15,GEORGE,What?
S08E15,ALLISON,"I really, think we need to talk."
S08E15,GEORGE,(pause) Uh-oh.
S08E15,JERRY,She wants to talk.
S08E15,GEORGE,"She doesn't Want to talk, she needs to talk."
S08E15,JERRY,Nobody needs to talk.
S08E15,GEORGE,"Who would Want to. She tried to end it with me, Jerry."
S08E15,JERRY,What'd ya do?
S08E15,GEORGE,"I told her I was out o' soda, I went out to get some, an' I never went back."
S08E15,JERRY,(pause) All night?!
S08E15,GEORGE,"Yeah, I slept at my parents' house."
S08E15,JERRY,And she wants to break up with you..
S08E15,GEORGE,Ha! (snort) Can you believe it? (amused) I'm supposed to be havin' lunch with her right now at Pomodoro.
S08E15,JERRY,"Uh-oh. ""Everybody breaks up at Pomodoro's."""
S08E15,GEORGE,So? What'm I gonna do?
S08E15,JERRY,You really like this girl.
S08E15,GEORGE,No. I like the ball! This is my One Chance to make a Great Entrance! My whole life! I have never made a great entrance!
S08E15,JERRY,You've made some Fine Exits.
S08E15,GEORGE,(admitting) All right..
S08E15,JERRY,So what do you do? You can't keep avoiding her.
S08E15,GEORGE,"(resolved) Why not. (determined) If she can't find me, she can't break up with me. And, if we're still goin' out, she has to gooo to the ballll."
S08E15,KRAMER,"(suddenly entering) Hey, oh--listen. Did you get my ticket from Allison--"
S08E15,GEORGE,"Yeah, yeah, right here. (hands it to him)"
S08E15,KRAMER,All right! Yeah.. Courtside.. Whoa! Don't let this girl get away..
S08E15,GEORGE,(clipping on shades) Ha.. She'll have to find me first. (leaving)
S08E15,KRAMER,"(All right.) (to Jerry) Ah? Oh, by the way you owe Mike a hundred dollars."
S08E15,JERRY,What for?
S08E15,KRAMER,"Well I put a bet down for ya on tonight's game. Yeah, if the Knicks beat the Pacers by more than thirty-five? It pays ten to one. Oo-oo! That's some sweet action!"
S08E15,JERRY,"But I don't want any ""sweet action."""
S08E15,KRAMER,"Well, I couldn't do it I got a gamblin' problem."
S08E15,JERRY,So you put down my money?!
S08E15,KRAMER,(impatient sigh) You don't have a problem.
S08E15,JERRY,"Not (with) that, no.."
S08E15,PEGGY,Susie. Susie!
S08E15,ELAINE,"(coming in) Uh.. Hi, Peggy. Um.. Look, I should have said this yesterday, but--"
S08E15,PEGGY,Did you get this memo from Elaine Benes?
S08E15,ELAINE,Yeah. See that--
S08E15,PEGGY,"(preoccupied) You know, it's amazing Peterman hasn't fired that dolt. She practically ran the company into the gro-ound."
S08E15,ELAINE,"Well. Well, I thought she did a pretty good Job.."
S08E15,PEGGY,"I heard she was a disaster, Suze--"
S08E15,ELAINE,"(testy, leans into Peggy's personal space) Look-it. It's not Suze. All right? It's Su-zie. My name, is Su-zie!"
S08E15,GEORGE,"(on tape, singing) ""Believe it or not, George, isn't at home, please leave a mes-saaage at the beep. I must be out or I'd pick up the pho-one. Where could I be? Believe it or not, I'm not hooome."" (beep)"
S08E15,JERRY,"George, pick up. I know you're screening for Allison."
S08E15,GEORGE,"(answers phone, good mood) Hey."
S08E15,JERRY,"So, coffee shop?"
S08E15,GEORGE,"No, I can't. She knows I go there. It's not secure. (the call waiting beeps) Hey, I got another call comin' in. I gotta let the machine get it. Bye. (hangs up)"
S08E15,GEORGE,"(on tape, singing) ""Believe it or not, George, isn't at home, please leave a mes-saaage at the beep. I must be out or I'd pick up the pho-one. Where could I be? Believe it or not, I'm not hooome."" (beep)"
S08E15,ALLISON,"(on phone machine, peeved) George? Are you there? (muttering) I hate that stupid message. (terse) I know you're avoiding me, I'm at the office, please call me, I've gotta talk to you. (hangs up)"
S08E15,GEORGE,"(to phone) Hi, Allison? Oh, I guess you're not at home.. I probably should 'ave tried you at the office. Anyway, good to hear from ya, really looking forward to the ball.. (hangs up and happily chuckles) Ha ha!"
S08E15,ELAINE,Can you believe this woman?
S08E15,JERRY,(ironic outrage) The nerve. Talkin' about ya behind your back--and right to your face!
S08E15,ELAINE,"No. ""Suze!"" I mean, ""Suzie!"" ""Suzanne!"" ""Suzanna."" Fine! But there is no, way, I'm gonna be a Suze."
S08E15,JERRY,No. No Suze.
S08E15,ELAINE,(tense) I mean--what am I--some pom-pom-wavin' Backseat Bimbo?!
S08E15,JERRY,Who are you describin'?
S08E15,ELAINE,Someone I know!
S08E15,JERRY,Named Suze?
S08E15,ELAINE,"No, still Sharon!"
S08E15,KRAMER,"(comes in, subdued) Hey. (grabs a water from refrigerator)"
S08E15,JERRY,"Hey, I thought you went to the game."
S08E15,KRAMER,No. I was kicked out for fightin' with one of the players. (leaving)
S08E15,JERRY,Wait. Way--way--way--way--way--way--wait! Who?!
S08E15,KRAMER,(stops) W--Reggie Miller.
S08E15,ELAINE,Cheryl Miller's brother?
S08E15,KRAMER,Yeah. (leaving)
S08E15,JERRY,"Hey--hey--hey--wait, wait, wait, wait! What happened!"
S08E15,KRAMER,"(stops again) Well, first of all, for some reason, they started the game an hour Late. And uh, I was sittin' next to Spike Lee an' he an' Reggie were jawin' at each other, so I guess I got involved. (leaving)"
S08E15,ELAINE,"(same time as Jerry) --Wait, whoa--whoa--whoa--whoa!--"
S08E15,JERRY,"Well--wait--wait--wait--wait! What do you mean ""involved""?!"
S08E15,KRAMER,"(stops again) Well I.. ran out onto the court an' threw a hotdog at Reggie Miller. ""Involved."" An' they threw meee, an' Reggie, an' Spike out o' the game."
S08E15,ELAINE,So that's it?
S08E15,KRAMER,"Well I, well I, felt, pretty bad about everything an' uh, then the three of us, we went to a strip club. (leaves)"
S08E15,JERRY,Can you believe that?
S08E15,ELAINE,I didn't know Cheryl Miller's brother played basketball.
S08E15,KRAMER,"(suddenly comes back, excited) The Knicks killed 'em a hundred an' ten to seventy three!"
S08E15,JERRY,"What--of course, without Reggie Miller, it's a blowout!"
S08E15,KRAMER,"No, Jerry--that's thirty-seven points! The Knicks covered! You won! See, that's a cooool-G, Daddy-O--now you gotta let it riiiide!"
S08E15,JERRY,On what?!
S08E15,KRAMER,"(real addict) Ah, come-on, Jerry--I don't wanna lose this feeling. Hey--let's go down to the O.T.B. We'll put some money on the ponies. (getting out pocket-watch)"
S08E15,JERRY,"Yeah, all right."
S08E15,KRAMER,(looking at watch) Ssssh--ah! They just closed!
S08E15,JERRY,(not) Oh. Too Bad.
S08E15,ELAINE,Mr. Peterman? You wanted to see me?
S08E15,PETERMAN,"Apparently Peggy--down in Design?--got into a liiiittle bit of a Tiff yesterday with somebody named, ""Susie""?"
S08E15,ELAINE,Su-sie?
S08E15,PETERMAN,"Yes. Between you, me and the lamppost. And the desk. Peggy says this ""Suze"" isn't much of a Worker."
S08E15,ELAINE,(nit) It's Susie.
S08E15,PETERMAN,"Nevertheless, Elaine. The House, of Peterman is in Disorder. First thing tomorrow morning I want to see you, Peggy, and, Susie right here, in my office."
S08E15,ELAINE,"(dismayed) Ah, all o'--all of us?"
S08E15,KRAMER,"Allison. Hi. Uh--listen I'm really sorry about what happened at the game last night. Listen--could I have a ticket tonight--'cause the Rockets are in town an' that, Hakeem Olajuwon? Ohhh--he's got a real attitude."
S08E15,ALLISON,"Kramer? Have you seen George, around? I can't get a hold of him."
S08E15,KRAMER,"Oh, yeah, yeah. Well, he--uh--visits the guy across the hall from me like every ten minutes."
S08E15,ALLISON,Oh yeah?
S08E15,JERRY,"(singing) Believe it or not, Geooorge isn't at home."
S08E15,MIKE,(comes up) Hey. Jerry.
S08E15,JERRY,Hey Mike.. How 'bout those Knicks?
S08E15,MIKE,"(a little anxious) Yeah! How 'bout 'em? Ha ha. Look, Jerry. I can't pay you."
S08E15,JERRY,Why not?
S08E15,MIKE,'Cause I don't have the money..
S08E15,JERRY,"Mike. You say you're a bookie? You take a bet an' then you can't pay? I don't know, Mike, to me it sounds a little, how you say.. ""Phony""?"
S08E15,MIKE,Just give me 'til Friday. Please. Please!
S08E15,JERRY,"You know, you're supposed to be the Bookie. Act like one."
S08E15,MIKE,I'm sorry. Uh--oh here--let me give you a hand with that.
S08E15,JERRY,(trying to shut the trunk hood) Something wrong with this trunk.
S08E15,MIKE,Oh. Let me see.
S08E15,GEORGE,"So--ah, Kramer. Why'd you ask me out to dinner? (amused) An' why Pomodoro?"
S08E15,KRAMER,"(quiet, delicately) Allison spoke to me, and um. She wanted me to speak to you."
S08E15,GEORGE,(quiet) Uh-oh.
S08E15,KRAMER,"We all know that this relationship isn't working. So Allison an' I think that the best thing to do is just.. make a, clean break."
S08E15,GEORGE,Can't we discuss this?
S08E15,KRAMER,(reasoning) We just don't think you're ready for a serious relationship!
S08E15,GEORGE,(dismayed) I didn't even know you wanted to get serious!
S08E15,KRAMER,"(dismayed) So what am I in this for? You know, I'm getting to a point in my life where I need something more than just.. a good time. (is tearing up)"
S08E15,GEORGE,(pause) Are you?
S08E15,KRAMER,Wha--me? No! No. But she is.
S08E15,GEORGE,"I, I can't believe this is happening!"
S08E15,KRAMER,"George, we're sorry."
S08E15,GEORGE,Krama. Please.
S08E15,KRAMER,"(leaves, upset) Waaa-aa--aa! I'm sorry--"
S08E15,ELAINE,"(entering, uneasy) Mr. Peterman, Peggy, I.. guess we, should just get this over with. (sits)"
S08E15,PETERMAN,Just Hold On a minute. Still One Short.
S08E15,ELAINE,"Oh. No, we're not--"
S08E15,PEGGY,Susie has been very rude to me.
S08E15,PETERMAN,"Well, Elaine, has nothing but Good things to say about Susie."
S08E15,ELAINE,"Look. (engaging smile) We don't have to name names, or, point fingers, or.. (breathes in) name names! (indicating empty chair) Me and her, have had our problems. She and I have had our problems! You and I, and she and you--"
S08E15,PETERMAN,"Don't you drag me into this! This is between you and her, and her. (indicating empty chair)"
S08E15,ELAINE,"Yes! And I am convinced that if she were here with us today, she would agree with me, too."
S08E15,PETERMAN,Who.
S08E15,ELAINE,(uh-oh) Her?
S08E15,PETERMAN,Where is she?!
S08E15,ELAINE,Ah--this is part of the problem!
S08E15,PEGGY,"Iiii thought I was, part of this problem."
S08E15,ELAINE,"(smiling, convincing) You're a, huuge part of the problem. But, I think that at it's core, this is a Susie-and-Elaine problem that requires, a Susie-and-Elaine solution! And, who better to do that than.. Elaine and Susie! Susie and Elaine!"
S08E15,PETERMAN,"Well, now that we have that cleared up.. why don't the three of us have lunch."
S08E15,ELAINE,"(feigning hearing something) What?! Oh! Oh, I'm, coming! I--I gotta go. (rushes out!)"
S08E15,PETERMAN,She is The Best. What was your name again.
S08E15,KRAMER,Mike's outside. He wants to talk to you.
S08E15,JERRY,Well why doesn't he just come in?
S08E15,KRAMER,"Because he's scared, Jerry."
S08E15,JERRY,Why is he scared.
S08E15,KRAMER,"(sighs, opens door) Come on in. Did you do this? (Mike has two hand casts on)"
S08E15,JERRY,"Yeah, but--"
S08E15,KRAMER,Uh--ah--ah! You broke his thumbs.
S08E15,JERRY,It was an accident.
S08E15,KRAMER,"Oh, is that what you call it when, Somebody doesn't Pay Up?"
S08E15,MIKE,"(desperate) I'll get you the money, Jerry. I got a hundred dollars in my front pocket if you want to, reach in an' take it!"
S08E15,JERRY,(hands up) I don't want it that way.
S08E15,KRAMER,"Nuh! Okay Jerry, how about if Mike fixes your truuunk, we call it even, an' this way, nobody has to get hurt."
S08E15,JERRY,(whatever) Fine..
S08E15,MIKE,"Oh--uh--thank you, Jerry, thank you! I won't forget this, I'm gonna fix your trunk good--real good!"
S08E15,KRAMER,"See that was nice, Jerry. (under breath) Oh, by the way, I'm the one who broke your trunk."
S08E15,JERRY,"Ah, it's just a car."
S08E15,GEORGE,Hi.
S08E15,KRAMER,"(looking down, nodding) Hi."
S08E15,GEORGE,"It's, funny runnin' into you here."
S08E15,KRAMER,"Yeah, yeah.."
S08E15,GEORGE,(embarrassed/self-conscious about his gut) Do I? Thanks.. You too..
S08E15,KRAMER,"Ooo, yeah.. (indicating his face, embarrassed) (Heh, right.) You know, it's gettin' kind of late, I, I really have to be going, so, uh, it's nice seeing you again, all right--"
S08E15,GEORGE,"(sad) Yeah! Yeah. Hey--hey you, you know.. Maybe I'll call you sometime."
S08E15,KRAMER,"George, it's over. It's just.. It's Over. (leaves)"
S08E15,GEORGE,"(pause) What do you think, Jerry."
S08E15,JERRY,"(wistful) I don't know, I just see you guys together."
S08E15,MIKE,Thumbs!
S08E15,MIKE,"(from inside the trunk) Oh! Help! Somebody, help! Help!"
S08E15,JERRY,So Peterman bought it? I can't believe you got away with that!
S08E15,ELAINE,"Well, I'm very fortunate to be surrounded by such stupidity."
S08E15,JERRY,"Yeah, I know how you feel."
S08E15,ELAINE,Do you hear something?
S08E15,JERRY,What?
S08E15,JERRY,"Oh, the trunk's broken, it's rattling."
S08E15,ELAINE,"Jerry, I don't know how much longer I can keep this up. They're starting to give Susie assignments now!"
S08E15,JERRY,"Well, there's only one thing to do. Eliminate her."
S08E15,ELAINE,What?
S08E15,JERRY,(firmly matter-of-fact) Get Rid of Susie. Make her disappear.
S08E15,ELAINE,I kinda like her.
S08E15,JERRY,She's Gooone.
S08E15,ELAINE,Jerry--
S08E15,JERRY,(impatient) Gone! (starts maniacally laughing) (briefly stops to point and explain) That bumper sticker.
S08E15,MIKE,"(desperately anxious) Oh God, I'm in trouble.."
S08E15,GEORGE,Krama. Open up! I--I know you're in there!
S08E15,KRAMER,"(opens door) Uh--George, uh--uh--it's five o'clock in the morning, what's the matter with you.."
S08E15,GEORGE,(sad) It's only four..
S08E15,KRAMER,Huh?
S08E15,GEORGE,"I--I've been, walkin' around all night.. I've been thinkin' about Allison and me.. an' you--"
S08E15,KRAMER,"Oh. Oh, George."
S08E15,GEORGE,Please. Give me another chance.
S08E15,KRAMER,(regretfully) Uh.. I know I'm gonna regret this. (sigh) All right.
S08E15,GEORGE,"(grateful, relieved) Thank you! I'm gonna make you both so happy!"
S08E15,KRAMER,"All right, all right, I'll see ya later. (shuts door)"
S08E15,GEORGE,(delighted!) Woooo!
S08E15,PETERMAN,Elaine! Where's Susie? I want her to head up our new Fingerless Glove Division.
S08E15,ELAINE,"(quiet) Oh, but I thought I was in line for that assignment."
S08E15,PETERMAN,Mmmmm--nah.
S08E15,ELAINE,"All right, then, I was gonna wait, to tell ya this, but.. last night, Susie.. (difficult subject, quiet) she took her own Life.."
S08E15,KRAMER,"(happy, enthused) We're takin' George back--"
S08E15,ALLISON,What?!
S08E15,KRAMER,He's gonna make us very happy.
S08E15,ELAINE,(quiet) Look at this turnout.
S08E15,JERRY,(quiet) Where did Susie find the time to meet all these people..
S08E15,ELAINE,(irritated) Your funeral's not gonna come close to this.
S08E15,PEGGY,(to herself) Oh my god! (quiet) Susie?
S08E15,ELAINE,"(quiet) Oh, oh--ho--I'm not Susie.. I'm Elaine."
S08E15,PEGGY,But I've been calling you Susie.
S08E15,ELAINE,Oh! Hadn't noticed! Excuse me. (she's going to the podium)
S08E15,PEGGY,I guess I never met Susie.
S08E15,JERRY,(privately amused) Suze? I actually had a little thing with her for a while. (indicating Elaine) Her too.
S08E15,ELAINE,What can you say about a girl like Susie? (she doesn't know..)
S08E15,KRAMER,Hey.
S08E15,GEORGE,"Where's uh, where's Allison.."
S08E15,KRAMER,"Oh, Allison, she didn't want to come."
S08E15,GEORGE,But you took me back.
S08E15,KRAMER,"Well, yeah, I did, but she's a tough nut. How d'ya like the tuxedo. It's a rental but I've had it for fifteen years. All right, eh. (heading in)"
S08E15,GEORGE,Where are you goin'..
S08E15,KRAMER,"The Ball, silly."
S08E15,GEORGE,"(afraid not) No no, no no no. You're not goin' in there."
S08E15,KRAMER,George. I thought you were gonna Change.
S08E15,GEORGE,(impatient) For her. Not for you.
S08E15,KRAMER,"(light admonishing, under breath) Let's just try, an' have a nice time for once, an' we'll talk about this when we get home.."
S08E15,GEORGE,"All right, look--wait--wait--Krama--wait, wait a minute, you are not. You are not goin' in. Ah-ahhh!"
S08E15,WILHELM,"Wow! What an, Entrance! (friendly, to George) And eh, who might this be?"
S08E15,KRAMER,"Oh, I'm with him."
S08E15,WILHELM,Oh. Ah-ha..
S08E15,ELAINE,"And.. also, much like me, Susie hated going to the, Market."
S08E15,PETERMAN,Elaine! May I say a few words.
S08E15,ELAINE,"Oh, god, yes, Mr. Peterman. (steps down)"
S08E15,PETERMAN,"(steps up to the podium, refreshed) Ahhh. I don't think I'll ever be able to forget Susie--ahhh. And most of all, I will never, forget that one night. Working late on the catalogue. Juuust the two of us. And we surrendered to temptation. And it was Pretty Good."
S08E15,JERRY,"(proud to Peggy, under his breath) Yeah, but he didn't sleep with both of 'em. (winks)"
S08E15,PETERMAN,But Iiii never heard her Cries for Help. (sighs) An' nowww.. Susie is gone.
S08E15,MIKE,"(running in, still hoarse, desperate!) Hold on! Hol--on! Susie didn't commit suicide! (rushes up to podium!) She was Murdered, by Jerry, Sein-feld!"
S08E15,JERRY,"(smugly, under-his-breath) Not only that, I broke his thumbs."
S08E15,PETERMAN,"Elaine? Guess what. I've decided to Form a Charitable Foundation, in Susie's honor. And as Susie's best friend, I want you to be involved."
S08E15,ELAINE,"Mr. Peterman.. (leaning forward, whispering) I'm Susie.. She's me.."
S08E15,PETERMAN,"(leans forward, whispers carefully) I feel the same way. (announcing) And that's why this foundation will meet around Your Schedule. Nights! Weekends! Every, Free Moment you have. (leaving, pats her shoulders confidently)"
S08E15,ELAINE,"(looks up, screaming in frustration!) Suuuuuuuuuuze!"
S08E16,[Jenna's Apartment,Bathroom]
S08E16,JENNA,Morning.
S08E16,JERRY,Morning.
S08E16,JENNA,Hope you don't mind baking soda flavour.
S08E16,JERRY,"(applying paste to brush) Ah, baking soda. Annoying little product. 'I can do this. I can do that.' Why doesn't this stuff just shut up?"
S08E16,JENNA,I'm gonna grab you a towel.
S08E16,JERRY,Ooh-ooh
S08E16,GEORGE,So?
S08E16,JERRY,So? She used the toothbrush!
S08E16,GEORGE,"You said you grabbed it outta there real fast, right?"
S08E16,JERRY,Yeah.
S08E16,GEORGE,"So I'm sure whatever germs it landed on were knocked out, and by the time the rest of them realised what was going on, you had already grabbed it out."
S08E16,JERRY,How many years of med school did you have?
S08E16,GEORGE,Was she mad?
S08E16,GEORGE,You didn't tell her.
S08E16,JERRY,Jenna's like me. She's very... (searches for word)
S08E16,GEORGE,Finicky? Prissy? Fastidious?
S08E16,JERRY,I'll take fastidious.
S08E16,JERRY,What is that?
S08E16,GEORGE,"Ahh, Steinbrenner gave 'em to us, in honour of Phil Rizzuto being inducted into the Hall of Fame."
S08E16,HEAD,Holy cow!
S08E16,JERRY,"They don't actually have to squeeze his head to get him to say 'holy cow', do they?"
S08E16,GEORGE,Just the last few innings of a double-header.
S08E16,KRAMER,"Hey. Look at this. I'm in the passing lane of the Arthur Berkhardt expressway, going seventy and (makes impact sound - pckergh!) Dragged this thing for five exits."
S08E16,JERRY,Why didn't you pull over?
S08E16,KRAMER,"Well I was draughting behind a semi. I didn't wanna lose him. The infrastructure, Jerry, it's crumbling."
S08E16,HEAD,Holy cow!
S08E16,KRAMER,"Well, look at that. A talking Nixon."
S08E16,OWNER,China Panda.
S08E16,ELAINE,"Yeah, I'd like to place an order."
S08E16,OWNER,"Ah yes, what you like?"
S08E16,ELAINE,"This Supreme Flounder, it says first time served in America. Is that true?"
S08E16,OWNER,What number?
S08E16,ELAINE,Forty-seven.
S08E16,OWNER,"Yeah, first time. What else?"
S08E16,ELAINE,"Uh, that's it."
S08E16,OWNER,Address?
S08E16,ELAINE,"Seventy-eight, West Eighty-sixth Street. Apartment three E."
S08E16,OWNER,"That's southside. Sorry, we don't deliver below Eighty-sixth."
S08E16,ELAINE,I'm not below.
S08E16,OWNER,Yes you are. Street itself is boundary.
S08E16,ELAINE,Your guy can't cross to my side?
S08E16,OWNER,"If we deliver to you, then what? Eighty-fifth Street, Wall Street, Mexico, Eighty-fourth Street."
S08E16,ELAINE,"Alright, fine. I'll just cross and meet him."
S08E16,OWNER,"Sorry, food only for those who live within boundary. (slams down phone)"
S08E16,OWNER,(picks up phone) China Panda.
S08E16,ELAINE,"(using silly voice) Uh, yeah yeah. I'd like to place an order."
S08E16,OWNER,"Ah, what you like?"
S08E16,KRAMER,"Well, I'm a poppa."
S08E16,JERRY,Bring it on. Nothing's throwing me at this point.
S08E16,KRAMER,"(handing Jerry a cigar) Well, as of today I am a proud parent of a one-mile stretch of the Arthur Berkhardt Expressway."
S08E16,JERRY,"Oh, that adopt-a-highway thing."
S08E16,KRAMER,"Yeah, I'm part of the solution now Jerry. Yeah, I went down there and I checked it out this morning. Here, take a look. Mile one-fourteen."
S08E16,JERRY,"Aw, looks just like you."
S08E16,KRAMER,"Aw, I'm beaming Jerry."
S08E16,JERRY,So what d'you have to do? Pay to keep it clean?
S08E16,KRAMER,"They try to push you into using their cleaning crew, with all their so-called maintenance equipment."
S08E16,JERRY,That old scam.
S08E16,KRAMER,"Yeah, well that's why I'm doing it all myself. This parenting isn't about delegating responsibility, it's about being there."
S08E16,JERRY,"At the side of the road, with a pile of garbage."
S08E16,KRAMER,Quality time.
S08E16,GEORGE,Keys. I can't find my keys.
S08E16,JERRY,You lost Phil Rizzuto's head?!
S08E16,GEORGE,Have you seen 'em?
S08E16,JERRY,No.
S08E16,GEORGE,Dammit!
S08E16,KRAMER,"C'mon, retrace your steps. What d'you do today?"
S08E16,GEORGE,"I got up, I was supposed to go to work, I came here instead."
S08E16,KRAMER,Right.
S08E16,JERRY,"Well, they're not here. You'll have to dig up your spare set."
S08E16,GEORGE,I don't have a spare set. All my keys say 'do not duplicate'.
S08E16,JERRY,So?
S08E16,GEORGE,So you can't duplicate 'em.
S08E16,KRAMER,Sure you can. (to Jerry) Such a sweet kid.
S08E16,ELAINE,"Oh. Oh, hi. China Panda?"
S08E16,DELIVERY BOY,(suspicious) Why you waiting on the street and not in your apartment?
S08E16,ELAINE,I... thought that I would meet you halfway.
S08E16,DELIVERY BOY,You really live here?
S08E16,ELAINE,"Oh yeah. (handing over money) There you go, keep the change. Bye now. I'll see you."
S08E16,ELAINE,(at the boy's back) This isn't fair. This is address discrimination!
S08E16,JERRY,"Well, I cleaned out their whole dental hygiene shelf."
S08E16,GEORGE,So the plan is to secretly sterilise her mouth?
S08E16,JERRY,"By the time I'm through with her mouth, she'll be able to eat off it. Is it safe to drink bleach if you dilute it?"
S08E16,GEORGE,"No, stings the throat. Anyway, so I was coming along here, and I felt like a piece of cake, you know? But then I thought, it's morning, I should really have a muffin. I like those chocolate chip ones. Then I figured, well, they're really both cake. So I, uh, I sat on that bench for a little while, twenty minutes or an hour, and then I figured, check and see what you were up to. (a thought occurs to him) Wait a minute, wait a minute. The broad jump! The broad jump over the pothole on Eighty-sixth Street!"
S08E16,GEORGE,"Now I remember, as I jumped over the hole I heard a, like a jingling sound."
S08E16,JERRY,You didn't look down?
S08E16,GEORGE,I was trying to stick the landing. (indistinct) ...was right around here.
S08E16,GEORGE,No! No!!
S08E16,HEAD (O.C.),"Holy, Holy Cow!"
S08E16,JERRY,Poor son of a bitch.
S08E16,JERRY,It's a hundred thousand revolutions a second. It's the most powerful one they make.
S08E16,JENNA,It's like I'm holding a blender.
S08E16,JERRY,The engine's made by McDonnell-Douglas.
S08E16,JERRY,"Oh no, you keep going. It shuts off automatically."
S08E16,JENNA,"(restarting and reapplying the brush) Really, it does?"
S08E16,JERRY,(unheard by Jenna) When the battery runs out.
S08E16,JENNA,(shouting to Jerry) I was really happy with my old toothbrush.
S08E16,JERRY,"No, trust me, that one was doing more harm than good. Don't forget to use the Plax too."
S08E16,JENNA (O.C.),That stuff tastes like bleach!
S08E16,JERRY,I don't know anything about that.
S08E16,JENNA,Mmm. My mouth feels so clean.
S08E16,JERRY,That's the idea.
S08E16,JERRY,"You know, maybe we better not. I, I think I'm getting a little cold. I don't wanna give you any of my germs."
S08E16,JENNA,"Aww. Okay. Thanks, I guess."
S08E16,ELAINE,You still couldn't kiss her?
S08E16,JERRY,"She has a taint. I can't see it, but I know it's there."
S08E16,ELAINE,"Oh, so now you're finding fault on a sub-atomic level."
S08E16,JERRY,"Maybe if I could shrink myself down, like in Fantastic Voyage, and get inside a microscopic submarine, I could be sure. Although if there was something there, it might be pretty scary. Course, I would have that laser."
S08E16,ELAINE,"Jer, do you see where this is going?"
S08E16,JERRY,Being really clean and happy?
S08E16,ELAINE,"Jerry, you have tendencies. They're always annoying, but they were just tendencies. But now, if you can't kiss this girl, I'm afraid we're talking disorder."
S08E16,JERRY,Disorder?
S08E16,ELAINE,"And from disorder, you're a quirk or two away from full-on dementia."
S08E16,JERRY,"(thoughtful) Hmm, that could hurt me. (pointing out of window) Hey, there it is."
S08E16,ELAINE,Shall we stop and say hi?
S08E16,JERRY,"Nah, we've seen it."
S08E16,ELAINE,Yeah.
S08E16,KRAMER,"(shouting after car) Hey Jerry! Yeah, I'll see you back at the house!"
S08E16,KRAMER,"Mile one-fourteen, clean as a whistle."
S08E16,MAN,Yeah?
S08E16,ELAINE,"Hi. I'm your neighbour, uh, fr... from across the street. And uh, (coughs nervously) I was wondering, if it wouldn't be too much trouble, if I could use your apartment to order some food?"
S08E16,MAN,Wha? What d'you want?
S08E16,ELAINE,"You see, there's this certain flounder and they won't deliver it to my side of the street."
S08E16,MAN,"Wh, when is that?"
S08E16,ELAINE,"No, I just need them to deliver it here and I have to be kinda inside is all."
S08E16,MAN,Who are you with?
S08E16,ELAINE,"No, actually I'm... I'm just kind of hungry."
S08E16,MAN,Who let you in?
S08E16,ELAINE,"Well, the lock was broken. You just have to jiggle it, actually. But, I just need like a half an hour to an hour."
S08E16,JERRY,What's with the signs?
S08E16,KRAMER,"Hey, you should see the Berkhardt, Jerry. My mile is spotless. I mean the big stuff was easy. Cinderblocks, air-conditioners, shopping carts (makes sound - fzup!), I just rolled 'em into the woods."
S08E16,JERRY,"Yeah, that stuff's all natural anyway."
S08E16,KRAMER,"(holding up a sign) Speed limit, one hundred and sixty-five miles per hour. See? They slipped a one in there. (laughing) Those kids with the spray paint, God love 'em."
S08E16,JERRY,"Hey. So, keys?"
S08E16,GEORGE,No keys. And I been calling the city all day. Course there's not really a number to call if you wanna make a pothole.
S08E16,JERRY,I guess they leave that up to the general population.
S08E16,GEORGE,"I tell you this. If the real Phil Rizzuto was down there, this wouldn't be happening!"
S08E16,JERRY,Hard to say.
S08E16,KRAMER,"Hey, you need some roadwork done? 'Cos I met some maintenance guys today on the highway, they could probably help you out."
S08E16,GEORGE,Really?
S08E16,KRAMER,"Oh yeah, yeah. I borrowed some cones from them when I was sweeping my car-pool lane."
S08E16,JERRY,Yeah?
S08E16,JENNA (O.C.),It's Jenna.
S08E16,JERRY,"If you guys wouldn't mind, I would like to ward off dementia."
S08E16,GEORGE,You think you could hook me up with these guys?
S08E16,KRAMER,"Oh yeah, yeah. Give me a ring tomorrow. I'm gonna be at emergency callbox seven-eight-four."
S08E16,GEORGE,Seven-eight-four.
S08E16,JENNA,Hey.
S08E16,JERRY,Hi.
S08E16,JENNA,How you feeling?
S08E16,JERRY,"Good. My cold's gone, and I've been looking forwards to kissing you, which I'm ready to do now, if you are ready."
S08E16,JENNA,What?!
S08E16,JERRY,"Nothing. I just, I uh, I bruised my lip. I was drinking a Celray, and I brought it up too fast and I banged it into my lip, (lower voice and hurriedly) and then I knocked your toothbrush into the toilet and I wasn't able to tell you before you could use it."
S08E16,JENNA,What?
S08E16,JERRY,I'm sorry.
S08E16,JENNA,When were you gonna tell me this?!
S08E16,JERRY,Obviously never.
S08E16,KRAMER,I need the yield sign.
S08E16,JERRY,"Kramer, I'm kind of in the middle of something. Would you get these signs out of here, please?"
S08E16,KRAMER,You could've introduced me.
S08E16,JERRY,I wouldn't know where to start.
S08E16,JERRY,"(knocking) Hey, Jenna. Hey!"
S08E16,JENNA,There. Now something of yours has been in the toilet.
S08E16,JERRY,What?! Wha... what'd you put in there?
S08E16,JENNA,Gotta run.
S08E16,JERRY,"Oh, man!"
S08E16,JERRY,"(into phone) Hello, Jenna, did you dunk the spatula? Was it the spatula? Hello? Dammit!"
S08E16,ELAINE,She won't even give you a hint?
S08E16,JERRY,No. Could be anything. The whole apartment's a biohazard.
S08E16,ELAINE,You know what I bet it is? (points) Your remote.
S08E16,JERRY,"Yes, that is a definite possibility."
S08E16,ELAINE,"(walking to the couch) Or, could be your walkman there."
S08E16,JERRY,Are you just screwing with me?
S08E16,ELAINE,"Yeah, I am."
S08E16,KRAMER,Hey ah.
S08E16,JERRY,"Hey, how's life on the road?"
S08E16,KRAMER,"Oh, I'm making a difference Jerry."
S08E16,JERRY,I don't doubt it.
S08E16,KRAMER,"You should see the smiles on the drivers' faces. I mean, you gotta look quick, but they're there."
S08E16,JERRY,What's this?
S08E16,KRAMER,"Well, you know, those annoying little bumps on the lane-lines? (makes noise - bum, bum, bum, bum, bump)"
S08E16,JERRY,Isn't that some kind of safety thing?
S08E16,KRAMER,"Well, I had to pull 'em up if I'm gonna widen the lanes."
S08E16,JERRY,What the hell are you talking about?
S08E16,KRAMER,"Ah, you know how in planes they got first class? More leg room, better ride? Well, I'm bringing that concept to mile one-fourteen."
S08E16,ELAINE,How are you gonna widen the lanes?
S08E16,KRAMER,"Well you black out lane-lines one and three, and a four-lane highway becomes a two-lane comfort cruise. (to Jerry) So, you got any black paint?"
S08E16,JERRY,"(sarcasm) Yeah, in my toolshed, next to the riding mower."
S08E16,ELAINE,"(into phone) Yuh, I'd like an order of supreme flounder, number forty-seven. Yeah, apartment one-Q."
S08E16,JERRY,One-Q? Whose apartment is that?
S08E16,ELAINE,"That's the janitor closet, across the street."
S08E16,JERRY,"You're pretending to live in a janitor's closet, just to get this flounder?"
S08E16,ELAINE,"It's better than eating it alone in the restaurant, like some loser."
S08E16,KRAMER,That stuff is unbelievable. I'd eat it out of a dumpster.
S08E16,ELAINE,(heading to door) How do you know about it? You're not in the delivery zone.
S08E16,KRAMER,"Well, Newman uses his mail truck to run fish for China Panda on the weekends."
S08E16,ELAINE,"Well, mine's coming in ten, so... see you boys."
S08E16,KRAMER,"Now, where's that tool shed of yours?"
S08E16,ELAINE,"Hi. Sorry, I didn't hear you. I was in the shower."
S08E16,ELAINE,I'll see you.
S08E16,RALPH,You Costanza?
S08E16,GEORGE,"Yeah. Thanks for, thanks for coming by fellas. Eh, got a set of keys, buried in the pothole."
S08E16,RALPH,What're the keys doing in there?
S08E16,GEORGE,"Just need to uh, to dig 'em up."
S08E16,RALPH,You put 'em in there?
S08E16,GEORGE,"Nah, nah, it's uh, it's a long story. Just uh, try to get it up."
S08E16,RALPH,Bad place to put your keys.
S08E16,GEORGE,"Yeah, I know that. (clears throat) Could you start, working?"
S08E16,RALPH,"Difficult job. You want those keys, we're gonna have to dig this up."
S08E16,GEORGE,"(penny drops) Oh, uh, wait a minute, wait a minute. (snorts) Is this about money?"
S08E16,RALPH,Yeah. (snorts) It's about money.
S08E16,MRS ALLISTER,"'Scuse me, what are you doing in there?"
S08E16,ELAINE,"Uhm, nothing. I was just uhm... I wasn't in there."
S08E16,MRS ALLISTER,"You were hanging around in there, lazing on the job. When you shoulda been downstairs in the basement, cleaning out those old carpets and scrap wood."
S08E16,ELAINE,"Right, because... I'm the janitor. (picks teeth with fingernail)"
S08E16,MRS ALLISTER,Don't get smart with me.
S08E16,ELAINE,(meek) Yes ma'am.
S08E16,RADIO,"Hey, and if you're heading north on the Arthur Berkhardt, whoah Nelly, for some reason four lanes are converging into two, instantaneously right at mile-marker one-fourteen. I don't know what that is, but the A-B's a parking lot out there. Somebody screwed up on that one."
S08E16,ELAINE,Oh it's you.
S08E16,JERRY,Is the flounder here yet?
S08E16,ELAINE,"No, it's not here yet. You want the tour?"
S08E16,ELAINE,(gesturing) There's this.
S08E16,JERRY,"Nice. French doors'd really open this place up. Oh, but you have a slop-bucket."
S08E16,ELAINE,(gleeful) The fish!
S08E16,ELAINE,"Ah, what're you doing here?"
S08E16,GEORGE,Hey.
S08E16,JERRY,Hey.
S08E16,GEORGE,"Oh, I was uh, I was waiting downstairs for the jackhammer, thought I'd drop by."
S08E16,JERRY,Kramer's guys?
S08E16,GEORGE,Yeah. I got 'em down to fifty bucks. I just have to do all the jackhammering myself.
S08E16,JERRY,"Oh that's nice, kind of a hard-labour fantasy camp."
S08E16,GEORGE,Ow!
S08E16,ELAINE,"Uh, man!"
S08E16,KRAMER,"Huh, yeah. (looks round) Oh, sweet setup. Elaine, d'you have any paint thinner? I need like uh, forty gallons."
S08E16,ELAINE,I'm plumb out.
S08E16,KRAMER,"Oh man, if I don't get that black paint off the City's gonna go ape. I don't wanna lose my baby!"
S08E16,MRS ALLISTER (O.C.),Janitor?
S08E16,ELAINE,"(to the guys) Uh, Mrs Allister. (louder) Yeah, uh, just coming Mrs Allister. (to guys) Okay, I've gotta get out."
S08E16,ELAINE,"Here, can you move, you gotta move from the door."
S08E16,ELAINE,"Hi, I uhm... What can I do for you?"
S08E16,MRS ALLISTER,I told you yesterday to haul that trash outta the basement.
S08E16,ELAINE,"Yeah, I am so sorry."
S08E16,MRS ALLISTER,Some of the children have been playing near it and putting it in their mouths.
S08E16,ELAINE,"Well, a lot of it is vegetable..."
S08E16,MRS ALLISTER,"Get that stuff outta there today, or you'll be outta here. Understand?"
S08E16,ELAINE,(meekly) Yes ma'am.
S08E16,GEORGE,...stop pushing. (to Elaine) Kramer spilled ammonia.
S08E16,JERRY,I don't feel like eating.
S08E16,KRAMER,"(holding up a set of heavy chains) I'm gonna borrow this, huh?"
S08E16,ELAINE,(to Mrs Allister) Janitor's meeting.
S08E16,JENNA,"So Jerry, why'd you call me?"
S08E16,JERRY,"Well, I thought it's about time we put aside all this silliness. I know now you didn't put anything in my toilet bowl. (pause) Did you?"
S08E16,JENNA,"Yes, I did."
S08E16,JERRY,"Well, whatever. So, how've you been?"
S08E16,JENNA,Good.
S08E16,JERRY,Good. (pause) Steak knife?
S08E16,JENNA,Just eating away at you isn't it?
S08E16,JERRY,Nah.
S08E16,ELAINE,Hi.
S08E16,JENNA,Hi.
S08E16,JERRY,Hi.
S08E16,ELAINE,"Hi. Jerry, can I borrow your car?"
S08E16,JERRY,For what?
S08E16,ELAINE,I have to haul some dirty garbage to the dump.
S08E16,JERRY,"Dirt? That's alright, (for Jenna's benefit) because there's nothing wrong with dirt."
S08E16,ELAINE,"Well, actually it's pretty grimy."
S08E16,JERRY,"Grime, grease, filth, funk, ooze. Whatever it is, you take that stuff and put it right on my leather upholstery."
S08E16,ELAINE,"Well, I don't know who you are, but thanks for the car."
S08E16,JERRY,Sure. Bye.
S08E16,ELAINE,Bye.
S08E16,JENNA,Bye.
S08E16,ELAINE,Bye.
S08E16,JERRY,"There, you see? I just leant her my car, and she's gonna fill it with all sorts of... (he cracks) Alright! You win! That car was my last germ-free sanctuary. I slept there last night! Now, for the love of God, please, what is it? What is it?!"
S08E16,JENNA,Toilet brush.
S08E16,JERRY,"Toilet brush, oh (he pulls a 'Damn, shoulda guessed!' face). Alright, I can replace that."
S08E16,JENNA,You wanna order dinner?
S08E16,JERRY,"Yeah. Let's uh, go to your place. Because I, threw out all my dishes."
S08E16,JERRY,That's true.
S08E16,JENNA,Mm.
S08E16,JERRY,"But, I'll tell you this much. I am never going to let some silly hygienic mishap get in the way of, what could be, a meaningful, long-lasting relationship."
S08E16,JENNA,Do you hear something?
S08E16,JERRY,I don't know what that could be.
S08E16,HEAD,Holy cow!
S08E16,JERRY,"Anyway, I'm a new man, and I'm looking towards the future. Clean, dirty, whatever."
S08E16,JERRY,Holy cow! Have a nice life.
S08E16,ELAINE,"Hey, look at this. Wide lanes. This is so luxurious. Woo, yeah."
S08E16,KRAMER,Bugger!
S08E16,NEWMAN,(sings) You're once. Twice. Three times a lady.
S08E16,NEWMAN,What the hell was that?
S08E16,KRAMER,Double bugger!
S08E16,NEWMAN,"(sings) Yes, you're once. Twice. Three times..."
S08E16,NEWMAN,"Aaah! Aaagh! Aah-aah. Oh, oh the humanity! Aaagh!"
S08E16,KRAMER,Hey buddy. What're you doing out here?
S08E16,KRAMER,"Man, did you see that fireball? Woo-hoo-hoo, hoo-hoo."
S08E16,KRAMER,"Hey, I gotta skedaddle. You wanna lift?"
S08E16,KRAMER,Newman! Newman!!
S08E16,KRAMER,"Well, I'll meet you at the coffee shop."
S08E17,JERRY,"You know at the movies, they show that little ad for the concession stand?"
S08E17,ELAINE,Where the cartoon candy's dancing and the Milk Dud's playing the banjo?
S08E17,JERRY,He's wailing on that banjo.
S08E17,ELAINE,Yeah.
S08E17,JERRY,I just don't understand the raisinettes.
S08E17,ELAINE,The sax player?
S08E17,JERRY,Yeah.
S08E17,ELAINE,Yeah.
S08E17,JERRY,"The box of raisinettes runs up to the concession stand, buys another box of raisinettes."
S08E17,ELAINE,So?
S08E17,JERRY,Box of raisinettes eating another box of raisinettes? It's perverse.
S08E17,ELAINE,HE's not gonna eat them. He's buying 'em for his Pepsi girlfriend.
S08E17,JERRY,Why's he dating a Pepsi? They're not having children.
S08E17,ELAINE,He's a musician.
S08E17,JERRY,Musicians. Get a real job.
S08E17,WAITRESS,What d'you want?
S08E17,GEORGE,"Ah, I've had everything on the menu. Uh, surprise me."
S08E17,DANIELLE,(to George) Neil.
S08E17,DANIELLE,Neil.
S08E17,DANIELLE,"(apologetic) Oh, I am sorry. (smiling broadly) I'm supposed to meet my boyfriend here. He looks just like you."
S08E17,GEORGE,(bemused) Really?
S08E17,DANIELLE,(smiling) Yeah.
S08E17,GEORGE,(pointing to himself) Like me?
S08E17,DANIELLE,Uh-huh. Sorry.
S08E17,GEORGE,"(confused, to himself) Like me? But how?"
S08E17,WAITRESS,Here's your halibut omelette. Surprised?
S08E17,GEORGE,"Yes, yes, I am."
S08E17,KRAMER,"Look what I got for you, for your Florida trip. Crazy Shirts was closing 'em out. I got a dozen for a buck."
S08E17,KRAMER,Saved a fortune. Look at that. Heyy.
S08E17,JERRY,"(reading, unimpressed) Ohh, 'Number 1 Dad'."
S08E17,KRAMER,Yeah.
S08E17,JERRY,"(examining the label) Ooh, and it's in medium. Perfect."
S08E17,KRAMER,Hey.
S08E17,GEORGE,Hey.
S08E17,JERRY,Hey.
S08E17,GEORGE,Hey. You ready?
S08E17,JERRY,Almost.
S08E17,KRAMER,"Okay, look, uh, when you're in Florida, can my cigar guy drop off some Cubans for me at your parents' house?"
S08E17,JERRY,"(reluctant) Kramer, I'm helping my parents move into their new condo. I'm gonna be busy."
S08E17,KRAMER,"Aw, c'mon man. Help a brother out."
S08E17,JERRY,(grudging) Alright.
S08E17,KRAMER,Yeahh. I owe you one.
S08E17,JERRY,(holding up the '# DAD' shirt) We're even.
S08E17,GEORGE,"Jerry, figure this out. I'm in the coffee shop, and this beautiful girl I could never even talk to, mistakes me for her boyfriend."
S08E17,JERRY,(continuing to pack) That's a nice four seconds.
S08E17,GEORGE,(incredulous) I look just like him. I. Me. (flings his arms out) This! This is what her boyfriend looks like. How is that possible?
S08E17,JERRY,Maybe he has money.
S08E17,GEORGE,"(wondering) Maybe he doesn't. Maybe he and I are exactly the same, except for one minor, yet crucial, detail. You never know."
S08E17,JERRY,(zipping up his bag) Sometimes you do.
S08E17,GEORGE,"Maybe it's some small thing I could change. Like a moustache. Or wearing a top hat, or a monocle, or a..or a cane."
S08E17,JERRY,(picking up his bag and coat) Who's she dating? Mr Peanut?
S08E17,GEORGE,"(pointedly) She could do a lot worse than Mr Peanut, my friend."
S08E17,BLAINE,"So, what d'you wanna see?"
S08E17,ELAINE,(indicating a movie poster) What about Sack Lunch?
S08E17,BLAINE,(indicating another poster) How about The English Patient? It's up for all those Oscars.
S08E17,ELAINE,"Oh, c'mon Blaine. I mean, look at the poster for Sack Lunch."
S08E17,BLAINE,It's a family in a brown paper bag.
S08E17,ELAINE,(laughing) Don't you wanna know how they got in there?
S08E17,BLAINE,No.
S08E17,ELAINE,(disappointment) Aww. Sold out.
S08E17,BLAINE,"(to the booth guy) Oh, two for The English Patient."
S08E17,ELAINE,"So d'you think they got shrunk down, or is it just a giant sack?"
S08E17,GEORGE,"(smiling) Uh, hi. Uhm, remember me? I..I'm the guy who looks like Neil?"
S08E17,DANIELLE,(smiling back) Hi.
S08E17,GEORGE,"Huh-Hi. (looks around a little) Uhm, is Neil here?"
S08E17,DANIELLE,"Oh, no. He got held up at work."
S08E17,GEORGE,"Oh, that's too bad. I kinda wanted to meet him, seeing as how we look so similar."
S08E17,DANIELLE,"Well, you know, you don't look that much like him."
S08E17,GEORGE,(disappointment) Oh. Course not.
S08E17,DANIELLE,"No, you're a little taller."
S08E17,DANIELLE,You look like you're in better shape than Neil. Do you work out?
S08E17,GEORGE,"(smiling) Listen, I..I..I don't mean to seem forward..."
S08E17,GEORGE,...but is there any way that I could possibly have Neil's phone number?
S08E17,ELAINE,"(very dissatisfied) Why is everyone talking about ""The English Patient, it's so romantic"". (vehement) God, that movie stunk!"
S08E17,BLAINE,I kinda liked it.
S08E17,ELAINE,(firm) No you didn't.
S08E17,CAROL,"Elaine. Elaine, did you just see The English Patient?"
S08E17,GAIL,(tearful) Didn't you love it?
S08E17,LISA,How could you not love that movie?
S08E17,ELAINE,"How about, it sucked?"
S08E17,CAROL,"That Ralph Fiennes, I would give up my firstborn for him."
S08E17,ELAINE,"(aside) Huhh, getting the short end of that stick."
S08E17,MORTY,"Jerry, this is Del Boca Vista's new physical fitness room. They got medicine balls, you can bike ride, anything you want."
S08E17,JERRY,Stairmaster?
S08E17,MORTY,What?
S08E17,JERRY,Nothin'.
S08E17,MORTY,(opening his tracksuit top) See what I'm wearing?
S08E17,JERRY,"Oh, did you get that outta my bag?"
S08E17,MORTY,"No, your mother found it. Son, this is the most wonderful and thoughtful thing you've ever done for me."
S08E17,JERRY,"You know, I bought you a Cadillac. Twice."
S08E17,MORTY,"Hoh, here he is. This is the man I wanted you to see. Izzy Mandelbaum. He's eighty years old, but strong as an ox. (pointing) Watch this."
S08E17,MORTY,See that? You couldn't do that.
S08E17,JERRY,"I could, but I choose not to."
S08E17,SID,Hey Morty. (nodding toward Jerry) Who's this?
S08E17,MORTY,"This is my son Jerry, from New York. (leaning toward Sid) He thinks he can lift more than Izzy."
S08E17,JERRY,(protesting) I..I didn't say that.
S08E17,SID,"(calling over) Hey, Izzy, this kid says he can lift more than you can."
S08E17,IZZY,"Your kid's pretty funny, Morty. Should be a comedian."
S08E17,JERRY,"(smiles) Actually, I am a comedian."
S08E17,SID,That's not so funny.
S08E17,IZZY,"(challenging) Think you're better than me, huh?"
S08E17,MORTY,Izzy used to work out with Charles Atlas in the fifties.
S08E17,JERRY,(jocular) Eighteen-fifties?
S08E17,IZZY,"Yeah, that's it. It's go time. (points to the weights he put down) Let's see you lift that."
S08E17,JERRY,"(reluctant) Mr Mandelbaum, I..."
S08E17,IZZY,"C'mon, c'mon. Pump it!"
S08E17,JERRY,(consenting) Alright.
S08E17,IZZY,"Yeah, wrong attitude. you're not bringing that trash into my house."
S08E17,JERRY,There. Alright?
S08E17,IZZY,"Step aside, stringbean."
S08E17,IZZY,I'll show you. We're gonna take it up a notch.
S08E17,IZZY,(agonised) Ah! My back. Ugh.
S08E17,IZZY,(drawn out) Aaaahh.
S08E17,SID,"Somebody, call an ambulance."
S08E17,MORTY,(unpanicked) There's already an ambulance here for Mrs Glickman. There's room for one more.
S08E17,ELAINE,"(handing over her money) Okay, one for Sack Lunch. (taking the ticket) It's good, right? (smiling) Yeah, good."
S08E17,ELAINE,"(surprise) Hey, what're you guys doing here?"
S08E17,LISA,We just saw The English Patient again.
S08E17,GAIL,It's even better the second time.
S08E17,ELAINE,They make it longer?
S08E17,BLAINE,(to the girls) Got my umbrella.
S08E17,ELAINE,(shocked) Blaine!?
S08E17,BLAINE,Elaine.
S08E17,ELAINE,I thought you were busy tonight.
S08E17,BLAINE,"(cold) Well, to tell you the truth Elaine. I don't know if I can be with someone who doesn't like The English Patient."
S08E17,ELAINE,It's just a stupid movie.
S08E17,BLAINE,(to Carol) That's what I'm talking about.
S08E17,CAROL,"(taking Blaine's arm) Come on, Blaine. Let's go."
S08E17,BLAINE,(bitter) Enjoy Sack Lunch!
S08E17,ELAINE,(fierce) I will!
S08E17,HELEN,(accusing) How could you do that to Mr Mandelbaum? You should be ashamed of yourself.
S08E17,JERRY,(defensive) He egged me on.
S08E17,HELEN,You should be more mature.
S08E17,JERRY,He's eighty!
S08E17,MORTY,"(standing) Okay. Tomorrow, Jerry and I will visit Izzy and apologise. Now, goodnight."
S08E17,HELEN,(walking after Morty) You're not sleeping in that shirt. It's too tight.
S08E17,MORTY,This shirt will never leave my body.
S08E17,HELEN,(to Jerry) Goodnight.
S08E17,JERRY,"(smiling) Alright. Seven-thirty, got the place to myself."
S08E17,GUILLERMO,Jerry Seinfeld please.
S08E17,JERRY,"Ah, you must be Kramer's guys. (indicating) Come on in. You got the cigars?"
S08E17,GUILLERMO,What cigars?
S08E17,JERRY,Kramer said I was supposed to bring him back some Cubans.
S08E17,GUILLERMO,(indicating the threesome) We are the Cubans.
S08E17,KRAMER,"Yeah, hello, Jerry's place."
S08E17,JERRY,"(animated) They're real Cubans?! They're human beings, from Cuba?!"
S08E17,KRAMER,I said Cubans. What'd you think I meant?
S08E17,JERRY,Cigars!
S08E17,KRAMER,"Jerry, Cuban cigars are illegal in this country. That's why I got these guys."
S08E17,JERRY,(incredulous) You're making your own cigars now?
S08E17,KRAMER,"Yeah, yeah. I got investors all lined up."
S08E17,JERRY,(to Kramer) Hold on a second. (to Morty) Hiya dad.
S08E17,MORTY,(without looking up) Who are they?
S08E17,JERRY,They're Cuban cigar rollers.
S08E17,MORTY,(walking back out of the room) Don't tell your mother.
S08E17,JERRY,What is that bubbling sound? Are you making your tomato sauce?
S08E17,KRAMER,Hot and spicy.
S08E17,JERRY,"(accusing) You're not wearing a shirt, are you?"
S08E17,KRAMER,Yes I am.
S08E17,JERRY,What colour is it?
S08E17,KRAMER,Damn!
S08E17,GEORGE,"You know, you could've just given me Neil's number. You..you didn't have to take me out to dinner."
S08E17,DANIELLE,I wanted to give it to you in person.
S08E17,DANIELLE,"(flirtatious) You know, I don't have to be up in the morning, and I know a great breakfast place, right around the corner."
S08E17,GEORGE,Does Neil like to eat a big breakfast?
S08E17,DANIELLE,(inviting) Why don't you come in? We'll take about it.
S08E17,GEORGE,"(looking at his watch) I really should get going. Y'know, I..I wanna be home in case Neil calls."
S08E17,DANIELLE,"Well, goodnight."
S08E17,GEORGE,(hurried) I'll see you.
S08E17,WAITRESS,Rough night?
S08E17,ELAINE,"Ugh. You wouldn't believe it. My boyfriend dumped me. My friends, who I don't even like, they won't talk to me. (face-pulling) All because I don't like that stupid English Patient movie."
S08E17,WAITRESS,Really? I thought it was pretty good.
S08E17,ELAINE,"Oh, come on. Good? What was good about it? (scoffs) Those sex scenes! I mean, please! Gimme something I can use!"
S08E17,WAITRESS,"(sour) Well, I liked it."
S08E17,ELAINE,"(calling after) Hey. You forgot about my piece of pie. Hello? (irritated) You know, sex in a tub. That doesn't work!"
S08E17,JERRY,This is quite a condo.
S08E17,MORTY,The Mandelbaums own the Magic Pan restaurants.
S08E17,JERRY,The crepe place?
S08E17,MORTY,Yeah. This is all big crepe money.
S08E17,JERRY,(doubtful) There's crepe money?
S08E17,IZZY,What are you doing here?
S08E17,JERRY,"(apologetic) Aw, Mr Mandelbaum, I just wanted to come by and tell you how sorry I was that you hurt yourself."
S08E17,IZZY,What the hell is that?
S08E17,JERRY,What?
S08E17,IZZY,That shirt. You think that you are the number one dad?
S08E17,MORTY,This was a gift from my son.
S08E17,IZZY,"Oh, I see how it works now. (indicates Jerry) He knocks me outta commission, so (indicates Morty) you can strut around in your fancy number one shirt. (moves the bedcovers) Well, I'll show you who's number one."
S08E17,JERRY,"Mr Mandelbaum, please."
S08E17,IZZY,It's go time.
S08E17,IZZY,(pained) Ahh. My back. I can't move.
S08E17,MORTY,Call an ambulance.
S08E17,JERRY,I think I saw one a coupla doors down.
S08E17,JERRY,"(disbelief) So she wanted you to come up, but you left because you thought some guy might be calling you?!"
S08E17,GEORGE,(animated) Some guy. Some guy? Neil! I have got to find out how he could get a girl like Danielle.
S08E17,JERRY,"(pointing out the obvious) George, you've got Danielle. Forget about Neil. You've out-Neiled him."
S08E17,GEORGE,"(surprised) So, I'm Neil? How did I do that?"
S08E17,JERRY,"I don't know, but you better keep it up."
S08E17,GEORGE,I'm gonna go meet Danielle. (grabs his coat) There's a new Neil in town! (triumphant laughter) Hahaha!
S08E17,JERRY,"(to himself) I try to take a vacation, I come back, the whole operation's a shambles. (answers phone) Hello."
S08E17,MORTY,Hey Jerry. Number One here. Did you go see Izzy at the back specialist?
S08E17,JERRY,"I will, I just walked in the door."
S08E17,HELEN,You have to go see him.
S08E17,JERRY,Ma.
S08E17,MORTY,"Helen, will you stop bothering him."
S08E17,HELEN,"Jerry, that shirt is gone right to his head."
S08E17,MORTY,"Number One, signing off."
S08E17,KRAMER,"Jerry, I just picked up the Cubans at the bus station. (shrill) What's going on!?"
S08E17,JERRY,What?
S08E17,KRAMER,(animated) They're not real Cubans. They're Dominicans.
S08E17,JERRY,So?
S08E17,KRAMER,"So, Jerry, if my investors don't get Cubans, the whole deal's off."
S08E17,JERRY,What's the difference?
S08E17,KRAMER,"Jerry, once you've had real Cubans, there's just nothing else like it."
S08E17,JERRY,"(confused) We're talking about people, right?"
S08E17,KRAMER,"Yes, yes. The quality, the texture, the intoxicating aroma. These guys don't have it."
S08E17,JERRY,I thought they smelled pretty nice.
S08E17,KRAMER,"Jerry, your palate's unrefined."
S08E17,JERRY,Is not.
S08E17,KRAMER,Is too.
S08E17,JERRY,Is not.
S08E17,KRAMER,Is too.
S08E17,JERRY,I'm not having this conversation.
S08E17,KRAMER,Are too.
S08E17,JERRY,Am not.
S08E17,KRAMER,Are too.
S08E17,JERRY,Am not.
S08E17,KRAMER,Are too.
S08E17,PETERMAN,"Another productive meeting. By the way, I saw that English Patient film last night. It was extraordinary."
S08E17,DUGAN,(enthusiastic) Oh yes. It was so romantic. It ravished me.
S08E17,PETERMAN,"Elaine, what'd you think?"
S08E17,ELAINE,"(hesitant) Well, uh, act..actually, I haven't seen it. So, I couldn't tell you whether I liked it, or whether it really sucked."
S08E17,PETERMAN,(aghast) You haven't seen it?
S08E17,ELAINE,(shakes head) No.
S08E17,PETERMAN,That's it! Drop everything. We're going right now.
S08E17,JERRY,"Again, Mr Mandelbaum, this back specialist is supposed to be the best. So if there's anything else I can do, please don't hesitate to, uh, try and find my number."
S08E17,IZZY,"Uh, oh, wait."
S08E17,IZZY,"How 'bout that, huh? The World's Greatest Dad. My son made it for me."
S08E17,JERRY,(humouring him) That's very nice.
S08E17,IZZY,The best in the world. (pointing to himself) Which means I'm better than just number one.
S08E17,JERRY,"Well, I don't know how official any of these rankings really are."
S08E17,IZZY,"Hi, son."
S08E17,IZZY JR.,Hi daddy.
S08E17,JERRY,(surprise) This is your son?
S08E17,IZZY,I got married in high school.
S08E17,IZZY JR.,"(to Jerry) Hey, who are you?"
S08E17,IZZY,This is Seinfeld's kid.
S08E17,IZZY JR.,"Oh, you think you're tough, picking on an old man? (squaring up to Jerry) Maybe you'd like to try taking on somebody your own age."
S08E17,JERRY,(jocular) You got any kids?
S08E17,IZZY JR.,"Oh, you think you're better than me? (challenging) Go ahead, pick out anything in the room here. I'll lift it up over my head."
S08E17,JERRY,"(trying to defuse the situation) Look, no-one is lifting anything."
S08E17,IZZY,(pointing) The television.
S08E17,JERRY,(under his breath) Oh no.
S08E17,IZZY JR.,"This one's for you, Pop. It's go time."
S08E17,IZZY JR.,(pained) Ohh! My back!
S08E17,IZZY,(urgent) Call an ambulance.
S08E17,JERRY,(laconic) We're already in a hospital.
S08E17,HAFFLER,"Awright, partner. Let's get down to business."
S08E17,KRAMER,"(nervous) Okay, well, uh, I'll uh, I'll get the Cubans."
S08E17,KRAMER,They're right out here.
S08E17,KRAMER,"Hey, here they are. The Cubans. Real Cubans."
S08E17,HAFFLER,"You wouldn't be trying to sell old Earl Haffler Dominicans in a Cuban wrapper now, would you?"
S08E17,KRAMER,"(fidgety) Oh, now, come on. Look at these boys. If they were any more Cuban, Castro would've smoked them himself. Huh."
S08E17,HAFFLER,"(confusion) We're talking about people, right?"
S08E17,KRAMER,(puzzled) I think so.
S08E17,HAFFLER,I thought he quit smoking cigars.
S08E17,KRAMER,"Well, yeah, yeah. But they also rolled for his brother... (thinks for a second) ...Dennis."
S08E17,HAFFLER,(dubious) Dennis Castro?
S08E17,KRAMER,"Uh, Dwayne."
S08E17,HAFFLER,Get the hell outta my office.
S08E17,KRAMER,(shrill) What!?
S08E17,DANIELLE,"You know, Neil called me today."
S08E17,GEORGE,(interested) Really?
S08E17,DANIELLE,Yeah. He's pretty upset that I broke up with him to go out with you.
S08E17,GEORGE,"(smug) Ah, I guess I showed Neil who's Neil."
S08E17,DANIELLE,He wants to get together tomorrow night and have coffee.
S08E17,GEORGE,(little worried) Coffee? (thinks) I can beat that. Move in with me.
S08E17,DANIELLE,(surprised) What?
S08E17,GEORGE,(smiles) Beats the hell out of coffee.
S08E17,PETERMAN,(emotional) And I thought I knew what love was.
S08E17,ELAINE,(indifferent) Yuh.
S08E17,JERRY,(incredulous) You asked her to move in with you?
S08E17,GEORGE,I gotta stay one step ahead of Neil.
S08E17,JERRY,(musing) What if it's Neil Armstrong?
S08E17,GEORGE,(animated) Then I'm going to Mars!
S08E17,JERRY,What if it's Neil Diamond?
S08E17,GEORGE,"(tormented) Aw, shut up Jerry! Just shut up!"
S08E17,JERRY,"Alright, I gotta go back to the hospital."
S08E17,GEORGE,"What, to see the old guy?"
S08E17,JERRY,"No, I got into a thing with the son, and now he's laid up too."
S08E17,GEORGE,How old's the son?
S08E17,JERRY,I think he's the same age as the father.
S08E17,GEORGE,What is with this family?
S08E17,JERRY,"I dunno. It's like, if one of 'em dies, the other one wants to bench press the casket."
S08E17,KRAMER,"(quietly) Hey, Jerry."
S08E17,KRAMER,(noise - like shivery) Datiditadit.
S08E17,JERRY,You're cold?
S08E17,KRAMER,No. (indicates with his head) (noise again) Ditadidatidat.
S08E17,JERRY,Something wrong with your chest?
S08E17,KRAMER,(indicating with his thumb) Dijadidatjd. There.
S08E17,JERRY,(leaning round Kramer) Where?
S08E17,KRAMER,"(urgent) No, no. Don't look. Don't look."
S08E17,KRAMER,Over there. The Dominicans.
S08E17,JERRY,Aren't they supposed to be rolling cigars?
S08E17,KRAMER,"Well, it didn't quite work out, and now I've got nothing for them to do."
S08E17,GEORGE,So?
S08E17,KRAMER,"So, I taught 'em all about Cuba, and they really took to it. You know, Marxism, the Worker's Revolution, the clothing."
S08E17,JERRY,"Boy, they seem pretty angry about something."
S08E17,KRAMER,"(nervous) Yeah. I'm a little worried. When there's no work, and the people get restless, who do you think they come after? (pointing to himself, shrill) El Presidente!"
S08E17,JERRY,"I swear to you, I didn't know they TV was bolted to the table."
S08E17,IZZY JR.,"I bet you pulled that trick on my daddy, in Florida."
S08E17,JERRY,He couldn't handle the weight.
S08E17,IZZY,"(hostile) Oh, so now you think you're better than me?"
S08E17,IZZY JR.,(indicating Izzy) You think you're better than him?!
S08E17,JERRY,"(placatory) Look, let me just state for the record, I think you're both better than me."
S08E17,IZZY,Okay.
S08E17,IZZY SR.,My boys.
S08E17,IZZY,My dad.
S08E17,IZZY JR.,My grandpa.
S08E17,JERRY,"(incredulous) Oh, come on!"
S08E17,IZZY SR.,(indicating Izzy Jr) What happened to him?
S08E17,JERRY,He was trying to lift the TV.
S08E17,IZZY SR.,(pointing) That TV?
S08E17,JERRY,(consternation) Oh no. (to the bedridden two) It's go time.
S08E17,IZZY IZZY SR.. (O.C.),(pained) Oohh!
S08E17,IZZY SR.,Why didn't anybody tell me? It was bolted down!
S08E17,IZZY,I still thought you could do it.
S08E17,IZZY JR.,Me too.
S08E17,IZZY/IZZY JR/IZZY IZZY SR.,"(chanting and punching the air) Mandelbaum, Mandelbaum, Mandelbaum..."
S08E17,JERRY,"Fellas, fellas, look, I gotta go."
S08E17,IZZY,"Oh yeah, that's right. Go. Put us all in the hospital. And you've ruined our business with all your macho head games."
S08E17,JERRY,(defensive) I didn't ruin your business.
S08E17,IZZY,"Yes, you did. There's nobody there now at the Magic Pan to roll the crepes. We gotta close it up."
S08E17,JERRY,(uncertain) Don't you hire people to do that?
S08E17,IZZY,Each crepe has to be hand-rolled by a Mandelbaum. That's what puts the magic in Magic Pan!
S08E17,JERRY,"(thinking) So, you just need some guys that could roll 'em?"
S08E17,IZZY,Yeah.
S08E17,JERRY,(having an idea) I think I can help you out. I'll see you later.
S08E17,IZZY SR.,"(calls) Hey, I can't see the TV."
S08E17,JERRY,Here.
S08E17,IZZY,"You think you're better than us, don't you?! Huh!?"
S08E17,PETERMAN,"Elaine, I hope you're watching the clothes, because I can't take my eyes off the passion."
S08E17,ELAINE,"(quiet vehemence) Oh. No. I can't do this any more. I can't. It's too long. (to the screen) Quit telling your stupid story, about the stupid desert, and just die already! (louder) Die!!"
S08E17,PETERMAN,(surprised) Elaine. You don't like the movie?
S08E17,ELAINE,(shouts) I hate it!!
S08E17,CROWD,Shh!
S08E17,ELAINE,"(shouts) Oh, go to hell!!"
S08E17,PETERMAN,"(quietly) Well, why didn't you say so in the first place? You're fired."
S08E17,ELAINE,(grabbing her bag and coat) Great. I'll wait for you outside.
S08E17,JERRY,He was gonna fire you?
S08E17,ELAINE,The only way I could talk him out of it was that I agreed to go and visit the Tunisian desert.
S08E17,JERRY,Tunisia?
S08E17,ELAINE,That's where they filmed the movie. It's supposed to inspire me.
S08E17,JERRY,"Well, that doesn't sound so bad."
S08E17,ELAINE,I have to live in a cave.
S08E17,JERRY,(sardonic) Oh. (smiles)
S08E17,KRAMER,These Dominicans really know their way round a crepe. Look at that. It's like they're rolling a double corona.
S08E17,KRAMER,"(to one of the guys) Just a cigar made outta bisquik, huh, Guillermo?"
S08E17,DANIELLE,"I'm very happy with George. I'm sorry Neil, it's over."
S08E17,DANIELLE,"Come on, let's just eat our crepes."
S08E17,CUSTOMER,(pained scream) Aaghh!! My face!
S08E17,DANIELLE,(concerned cry) Neil!
S08E17,JERRY,Why are the crepes spraying?
S08E17,KRAMER,"(looks over at the three guys) The Dominicans are rolling them too tight. (regretful) Uhm, well, that's why you gotta get real Cubans."
S08E17,GEORGE,Danielle. Where's Neil? (indicating the bed) Is this him?
S08E17,DANIELLE,"Yeah, that blueberry crepe burned him pretty badly."
S08E17,GEORGE,(to Danielle) Whose cane is this?
S08E17,DANIELLE,It's Neil's.
S08E17,GEORGE,"(to himself) A cane. I knew it. (to Neil) So, we meet at last. I admire your skills, Mr Peanut."
S08E17,GEORGE,"Well, Danielle, (digs in his pocket) we should get going. I got a key made for you."
S08E17,DANIELLE,"George, I can't move in with you."
S08E17,GEORGE,(shocked) What?
S08E17,DANIELLE,"I'm sorry, but I'm taking Neil to a clinic in England."
S08E17,GEORGE,"(animated) N..no, no. You can't leave me. (frantic) Marry me! I'll burn myself. I'll burn my parents!"
S08E17,DANIELLE,Sorry George.
S08E17,NEIL,(beckoning) George.
S08E17,NEIL,(quiet triumph) I win.
S08E17,TAN,"Ladies and gentlemen. In just one moment, we'll be showing our feature presentation..."
S08E17,ELAINE,"(dread) No, no, no, no, no."
S08E17,TAN,"...the comedy hit, Sack Lunch, starring Dabney Coleman."
S08E17,ELAINE,"(cheering up) Ah, right! Aw, this is shaping up."
S08E17,GUY,"Excuse me, please."
S08E17,ELAINE,"Oh, sure."
S08E17,ELAINE,(uncomfortable) Ooh.
S08E17,GUILLERMO,Ladies and gentlemen. Because we have been exploited by your Magic Pan crepe restaurants...
S08E17,GUILLERMO,...we are hijacking this plane to Cuba!
S08E17,GUILLERMO,Everyone stay in your seats. And shut that movie off!
S08E17,ELAINE,"(annoyed) Aww, nuts!"
S08E18,GEORGE,"Oh, boy I was up to four in the morning watching the Omen trilogy."
S08E18,JERRY,That's good stuff.
S08E18,GEORGE,I can't to myself. I'm exhausted.
S08E18,JERRY,Can you grab a nap at work.
S08E18,GEORGE,Not with that big glass window looking out into the hall. I'd love a good nap. That's the only thing getting me out of bed in the morning. I'll see ya'.
S08E18,ELAINE,Bye.
S08E18,JERRY,So what are you doing now?
S08E18,ELAINE,I'm going to take a little stroll through the park.
S08E18,JERRY,With a gentleman caller?
S08E18,ELAINE,"Yes, his name is Hal."
S08E18,JERRY,The walking date is a good date. You don't have to look right at the other -person.
S08E18,ELAINE,It's the next best thing to being alone.
S08E18,JERRY,Shower?
S08E18,KRAMER,"No, pool. I just swam 200 laps."
S08E18,ELAINE,You are kidding.
S08E18,KRAMER,Look at hose babies [hands]. They're prunes. I saw Conrad going up to oyur place.
S08E18,ELAINE,"Oh, yeah, that's right. Those new kitchen cabinets. How is that coming?"
S08E18,JERRY,A little slow. I've got to hold this guy's hand on every little decision.
S08E18,ELAINE,"Hey, Kramer, listen, you've seen the Omen right?"
S08E18,ELAINE,What exactly was that kid?
S08E18,KRAMER,"Who, Damien? Nothing, just a mischievous, rambunctious kid."
S08E18,WILHELM,"Oh, George, have you seen the American league directory? It is a big green book. Oh, thanks kiddo."
S08E18,HAL,
S08E18,ELAINE,Well I don't care. It was delicious.
S08E18,ELAINE,Wanna sit down?
S08E18,HAL,"Oh, I don't sit on park benches. They're very bad for the back."
S08E18,ELAINE,Really?
S08E18,HAL,I threw my back out about 15 years ago. Ever since I have been very careful. I only buy furniture in the ergonomics store.
S08E18,ELAINE,"Oh those places have the stupidest names. Like, uh, ""Back in "", or ""Good Vertibrations""."
S08E18,HAL,"Not this one. It's called the ""Lumbar Yard""."
S08E18,CONRAD,"Oh, Jerry are you okay with this hinge?"
S08E18,JERRY,Yeah.
S08E18,CONRAD,"I can get you any kind you want, you know. Four holes, three holes, two holes, bronze, no hinge at all."
S08E18,JERRY,"You know, why don't we just go with the one in your hand?"
S08E18,CONRAD,"Oh, these are different."
S08E18,JERRY,Drop one. . . . left!
S08E18,GEORGE,"Jerry, look at my eyes."
S08E18,JERRY,A little less beady today.
S08E18,GEORGE,Because I'm REFRESHED. I finally found a way to sleep in my office. Under the desk. I lie on my back. I tuck in the chair. I'm invisible.
S08E18,JERRY,Sounds like a really cool fort.
S08E18,CONRAD,"Jerry, do you want a flat edge on this molding or do you want me to bevel it?"
S08E18,JERRY,I'll tell you what I would like you to do with it.
S08E18,GEORGE,"Conrad, is it?"
S08E18,CONRAD,"Conrad, Connie, or Con, whatever you prefer."
S08E18,GEORGE,"Uh, let me ask you a question. Could you, uh, expand the space underneath a desk to give it a little more headroom?"
S08E18,JERRY,He's kind of tied up here.
S08E18,GEORGE,"It'll have to be a night job anyway. You don't normally work after dinner, do you?"
S08E18,CONRAD,"There is no normal, whatever jerry wants. He wants me here late, I'm here late, he wants me here early, I'm here early, he . . ."
S08E18,JERRY,Why don't you just work on George's project for a while?
S08E18,CONRAD,Whatever you want.
S08E18,JERRY,So how was Wednesday's walk in the park with Hal.
S08E18,ELAINE,"Uh, it was okay,. He's coming over later to watch a movie. Hey listen, what's better for your back? Couch cushions or a folding chair?"
S08E18,JERRY,I don't know.
S08E18,ELAINE,"Uh, maybe we'll just stand and watch the tv. [knock knock]. I gotta go someone's at my door. Yeah!"
S08E18,DELIVERY GUY,Delivery. Elaine Benes?
S08E18,ELAINE,Yeah.
S08E18,DELIVERY GUY,"We're from the Lumbar Yard, we got your mattress."
S08E18,ELAINE,"Mattress, I didn't order a mattress. Who sent this? Hal Kitzmiller?"
S08E18,GEORGE,"Do you think it might be possible to add a little shelf like, uh, for an alarm clock?"
S08E18,CONRAD,You mean like that big?
S08E18,GEORGE,Like this.
S08E18,CONRAD,"Yeah, I can do that."
S08E18,GEORGE,"Thanks. You know this could sound crazy but, what do you think about adding a drawer for - like a blanket?"
S08E18,CONRAD,Blanket or quilt?
S08E18,GEORGE,Blanket.
S08E18,CONRAD,That thick?
S08E18,GEORGE,Maybe like this.
S08E18,CONRAD,Like that?
S08E18,GEORGE,"Yeah, like that."
S08E18,CONRAD,If that is what you want.
S08E18,GEORGE,That is what I want.
S08E18,CONRAD,"Hey George, you want this cup holder mounted on the left, or the right, or the middle, . . ."
S08E18,GEORGE,Whatever!!. . . . Oh oh oh this is unbelievable. This is better than my bed at home.
S08E18,GEORGE,Its been a long night. You go home and get some sleep.
S08E18,CONRAD,If that's what you want.
S08E18,GEORGE,That's what I want.
S08E18,WILHELM,Morning George.
S08E18,GEORGE,Good morning Mr. Wilhelm.
S08E18,KRAMER,got problems Jerry.
S08E18,JERRY,What happened?
S08E18,KRAMER,Well I had been swimming for three hours and I was in a real grove so I decided to keep going. But at ten they start the aquasonics Thirty-five geriatrics throwing elbows. It was like I was swimming through a flabby armed spanking machine.
S08E18,JERRY,How long did that last?
S08E18,KRAMER,"A half hour then diving class started. Well that got a little messy. I gotta find a new place to swim 'cause that pooll can't hold me, Jerry."
S08E18,JERRY,How was the movie?
S08E18,ELAINE,I cancelled. Hal sent a mattress to my apartment. The nerve of that guy.
S08E18,JERRY,Why?
S08E18,ELAINE,He's got a back problem.
S08E18,JERRY,So you think he was expecting a roll in the supportive hay.
S08E18,ELAINE,After one date!
S08E18,KRAMER,What's that guy's last name again?
S08E18,ELAINE,Kitzmiller.
S08E18,KRAMER,"Oh, that's right."
S08E18,JERRY,So what are you going to do with the mattress?
S08E18,ELAINE,I don't know. Chuck it?
S08E18,KRAMER,"Oh, no no no no I'll take it. Why don't you come over. Let's see if it will fit in my bedroom."
S08E18,ELAINE,"Oh, all right."
S08E18,KRAMER,My old one sprung a leak.
S08E18,ELAINE,You have a water bed?
S08E18,KRAMER,Sand! It's like sleeping on the beach.
S08E18,CONRAD,"Hi, Jerry I'm sorry I'm late. George and I have been up working all night long. I can make up the time in any number of ways."
S08E18,JERRY,How about this? . . . Finish this thing up today!
S08E18,CONRAD,Couple of questions for you.
S08E18,JERRY,No. No more questions. Just figure it out for yourself and get it done.
S08E18,CONRAD,All right Jerry. But I can figure it out myself any way you want.
S08E18,JERRY,Just . . . do it.
S08E18,STEINBRENNER,Costanza? Where's Costanza? . . . Excus mois? Have you seen Costanza?
S08E18,SECRETARY,I've seen him around.
S08E18,STEINBRENNER,"Um, I'm stuck on this song yesterday. I can't seem to get it out of my head. I don't know the name of that. ""She's a heart breaker, love taker . . ..Oh. Oh"" . . .very catchy. You know what? I can't stay awake for that guy. What is this? People? Um, the most beautiful people people. Ally Selica, Nothing wrong with that uh?"
S08E18,HAL,"Elaine, your taking this totally the wrong way. That's not what Ii intended."
S08E18,ELAINE,"Well, what did you intend, Hal?"
S08E18,HAL,I just wanted you to have the comfort and report you deserve. That's why I had the mattress custom designed for you.
S08E18,ELAINE,Custom designed?
S08E18,HAL,"They adjust the foam density and spring tension to your body type. I estimated your height and weight. Five eight, about 110 pounds?"
S08E18,ELAINE,"Uh, that is the nicest thing anyone has ever done for me."
S08E18,HAL,So you do like the mattress?
S08E18,ELAINE,"Oh, I love it. I'm glad . . . I kept it."
S08E18,FATHER,"Over there, that's Brooklyn . That's where Spike Lee lives."
S08E18,SON,"Hey, there's a man swimming in the water."
S08E18,FATHER,"Naw, that's probably just a dead body son. You see when the mob kills someone they through the body in the river."
S08E18,KRAMER,Jer.
S08E18,JERRY,Hi.
S08E18,KRAMER,Well my swimming pool problems are solved. I just found myself miles and miles of open lanes.
S08E18,JERRY,What is that smell?
S08E18,KRAMER,That's East River.
S08E18,JERRY,You're swimming in the East River? The most heavily trafficked overly contaminated waterway on the eastern seaboard?
S08E18,KRAMER,Technically Norfok has more gross tonnage.
S08E18,JERRY,How could you swim in that water?
S08E18,KRAMER,I saw a couple of other guys out there.
S08E18,JERRY,Swimming?
S08E18,KRAMER,"Floating, they weren't moving much. But they were out there."
S08E18,ELAINE,"(on phone) Hey, Kramer, it's Elaine, thanks for bringing my mattress back. And I guess I'll just get my spare key from you - whenever. All right, bye."
S08E18,ELAINE,"Oh, this is a good mattress. Sniff, sniff, Ugh!"
S08E18,STEINBRENNER,"What is with this guy? I've been waiting three and a half hours. Should I go? No way Jack! ??? at the registrar again, I'll tell you that."
S08E18,SeConrad,Mr. Steinbrenner?
S08E18,STEINBRENNER,That's what they call me.
S08E18,SeConrad,Your grandchildren are here to see you.
S08E18,STEINBRENNER,"Oh, well, send them in. Send the little tykes in.  little people .. pony express  wow,"
S08E18,JERRY,(on phone) hello.
S08E18,GEORGE,"Jerry, I'm trapped under my desk. Steinbrenner is in the room. You got to help[ me."
S08E18,JERRY,Who is this?
S08E18,GEORGE,"Jerry, . . ."
S08E18,BRADY,"Hi,"
S08E18,GEORGE,"Sh, sh, goodbye, sh, get away."
S08E18,BRADY,"Hi, I'm Brady."
S08E18,GEORGE,?? get away??
S08E18,JERRY,Why don't you just have him paged?
S08E18,GEORGE,Can't you think of something. Call in a bomb threat.
S08E18,JERRY,A bomb threat? Why would I call in a bomb threat?
S08E18,GEORGE,Just CALL!
S08E18,JERRY,I should have some reason.
S08E18,STEINBRENNER,"Hey you kids know tunes; see if this song rinSTEINBRENNER a bell, ""Heartbreaker , . . . """
S08E18,SeConrad,Mr. Steinbrenner we just received a call. There's a bomb in the building.
S08E18,STEINBRENNER,"A bomb in the building, oh, m'god. Quick, everyone under the desk."
S08E18,STEINBRENNER,Boy can you think of what went through my mind when I saw there wasn't going to be enough room under that desk for me and my babies.
S08E18,GEORGE,I'm sorry sir.
S08E18,STEINBRENNER,You know what I think? I think you knew about that bomb ahead of time.
S08E18,GEORGE,What?
S08E18,STEINBRENNER,"???? about that bomb. You climbed under that desk because you have ESP. George, what's on my mind? . . . Meatballs! Huh? Unbelievable. Anyway this terrorist had a specific demand. Not more cheap adjustable hats on hat day. He wants fitted hats just like the players wear."
S08E18,ELAINE,"Jerry, Jerry."
S08E18,JERRY,Yeah.
S08E18,ELAINE,What the hell is this? Where are you?
S08E18,JERRY,Over here. You can see right through here.
S08E18,ELAINE,What is this. It's like you're selling movie tickets back here.
S08E18,JERRY,It's kind of cozy.
S08E18,ELAINE,"Hey, you're not going to believe what Kramer did to my mattress. . . . I can't talk to you like this. So Kramer completely funked up my mattress."
S08E18,JERRY,Does it smell like the East River?
S08E18,ELAINE,How did you know?
S08E18,JERRY,Because Kramer has been swimming laps between the Queensborough bridge and the Brooklyn bridge.
S08E18,ELAINE,"Oh, GREAT!"
S08E18,KRAMER,"Oh man, I'm on the wrong floor again."
S08E18,ELAINE,"Hey, thanks for ruining my mattress. It reeks."
S08E18,KRAMER,"Hey, you know what I think it is? I think it's that East River. I think it might be polluted."
S08E18,GEORGE,"Well, you really did it to me this time, Seinfeld. . . . What the hell happened here?"
S08E18,ELAINE,Hi.
S08E18,GEORGE,Hi. Look at how obtrusive this is.
S08E18,ELAINE,"It is obtrusive, isn't it?"
S08E18,KRAMER,It is very obtrusive.
S08E18,JERRY,I don't think it's that bad.
S08E18,KRAMER,You can't get a stool in here.
S08E18,JERRY,No the stools go over there.
S08E18,KRAMER,"No, that's no good. I'm leaving."
S08E18,ELAINE,I'm with you. I'm going back to my place.
S08E18,GEORGE,Fitted Hat Day! That's what you asked Steinbrenner for?
S08E18,JERRY,You mean they're actually doing the fitted hats? Cool.
S08E18,GEORGE,Guess who he put in charge of Fitted Hat Day? Me.
S08E18,JERRY,Hey look at you.
S08E18,GEORGE,"Yeah, look at me. Now I GOTTA FIGURE OUT THE HAT SIZES OF 59,000 DIFFERENT PEOPLE!! WHAT IF A PINHEAD SHOWS UP. I GOTTA BE ON TOP OF THAT."
S08E18,JERRY,No knock offs. I want the ones like the real players wear.
S08E18,GEORGE,??? KNOCK OFFS. I NOT GOING TO DO IT! AND YOU'RE GOING TO CALL STEINBRENNER BACK AND CANCEL THE WHOLE THING.
S08E18,JERRY,Could you at least get a hat for me?
S08E18,GEORGE,FINE? WHAT SIZE?
S08E18,JERRY,Seven and five eighths
S08E18,GEORGE,SEVEN AND FIVE EIGHTHS!!
S08E18,JERRY,Why are you shouting?
S08E18,GEORGE,I DON'T KNOW. It's this place. I'm very uncomfortable here.
S08E18,HAL,So are you liking the mattress?
S08E18,ELAINE,"I am totally loving it. Uh, you know  we should um  get going."
S08E18,HAL,What is that smell?
S08E18,ELAINE,What smell?
S08E18,HAL,I think it's the mattress. Did something happen to it.
S08E18,ELAINE,"No no, oh, you know what that is? I um, went claming the other day and I forgot to hose off my boots."
S08E18,HAL,Claming?
S08E18,ELAINE,"Yeah, clam and scallop. I clam and scallop."
S08E18,STEINBRENNER,"Yes, yes, come in."
S08E18,GEORGE,"Sir, I just got a call from the terrorist. I told him to call back here."
S08E18,STEINBRENNER,"Just let me ask you something. Is it ""February"" or "" February""? Because I prefer ""Febuary"" and what is this ""ru""?"
S08E18,GEORGE,Let me put that on speaker phone.
S08E18,STEINBRENNER,Hello are you the bomber?
S08E18,JERRY,Yes this is the terrorist bomber.
S08E18,STEINBRENNER,Costanza here is busting his ass on those hats.
S08E18,JERRY,think I've changed my mind.
S08E18,STEINBRENNER,"You don't want them, then goodbye."
S08E18,GEORGE,??? sir.
S08E18,STEINBRENNER,Well what do you want instead?
S08E18,JERRY,What?
S08E18,STEINBRENNER,"Well, you're the terrorist. You're going to want something."
S08E18,JERRY,I guess it would be nice if you called all the ticket holders if the game was going to be rained out.
S08E18,STEINBRENNER,"All right George, you can handle that."
S08E18,STEINBRENNER,Costanza what the hell are you doing?
S08E18,GEORGE,You have to stand tough sir. That's why I had to hang up the phone.
S08E18,STEINBRENNER,"You know what I'm going to do? I'm going to run around the stadium and close all the windows. That's where I'm going, pal. And I'll tell you something else. I'm very nervous."
S08E18,ELAINE,Gotta get some of that stuffed crust pizza. cheese crust pizza.
S08E18,HAL,It's just more cheese.
S08E18,ELAINE,I'll tell you something. It'll be years before they find places to hide more cheese on a pizza. Kramer!
S08E18,KRAMER,"Oh, hey,"
S08E18,ELAINE,"Oh, hi. This is Hal. Hal, this is Kramer. Kramer, Hal."
S08E18,KRAMER,"Hal, .. uh Langerhans."

S08E18,HAL,Kramer? Can I talk to you a minute?
S08E18,KRAMER,"Yeah, sure, um, oh boy, . . ."
S08E18,HAL,Kitzmiller.
S08E18,KRAMER,That's it.
S08E18,HAL,You and Elaine are pretty close.
S08E18,KRAMER,"Oh, we go back a ways."
S08E18,HAL,"And you've, . . . how do I put this? You've been in her bed?"
S08E18,KRAMER,That's right.
S08E18,HAL,But this isn't still going on.
S08E18,KRAMER,"No, no. She put a stop to that."
S08E18,HAL,That's all I needed to know. So you actually swim in this thing?
S08E18,KRAMER,Oh yeah. Exercises every muscle in the body. It's great for the back.
S08E18,HAL,Great for the back. Right.

S08E18,JERRY,"Yeah, that's right."
S08E18,CONRAD,"You know I don't get you Seinfeld. You want something one day. The next day you don't like it. Come on man, make a decision."
S08E18,JERRY,One second. Hello.
S08E18,ELAINE,Jerry you gotta help me. I threw my back out.
S08E18,JERRY,Just lie down.
S08E18,ELAINE,I am lying down. I am trapped under a funky mattress. I gotta go get a doctor or at least come over and roll this thing off of me.
S08E18,JERRY,"All right. I'll be right there., Conrad I gotta go."
S08E18,CONRAD,"Stay, go whatever."
S08E18,HAL,"Hey, Kramer."
S08E18,KRAMER,What's going on?
S08E18,HAL,I told my Chiropractor how swimming in the river made my back heal. He recommended it to all his patients.
S08E18,OLD MAN,Step aside.
S08E18,KRAMER,He just sunk like a stone.
S08E18,GEORGE,"Sir, I'm sure it's not a police matter."
S08E18,STEINBRENNER,Don't be so sure George. Mess with them and they're messing with you. All right boys send it in
S08E18,STEINBRENNER,"What's that figure ahead? Is that anything? Okay, let's check the desk. That's where I heard the ticking. Search each one of those drawers starting with the top one. So, empty calories and male curiosity, eh, Georgie?"
S08E18,BOMB COP,Looks like there's more compartments underneath.
S08E18,STEINBRENNER,"Compartments underneath, that's probably where it is. Okay boys, let 'er rip. I'll tell you what George. Starting tomorrow no more desks. Just Lucite tables and four leSTEINBRENNER."
S08E18,KRAMER,"Hey, watch where you're kicking!"
S08E18,ELAINE,Kramer.
S08E18,KRAMER,Elaine
S08E18,ELAINE,"I can't believe it. Hey, I'll meet you at the coffee shop."
S08E18,KRAMER,Yeah.
S08E18,ELAINE,Yeah.
S08E18,GEORGE,"Hi Connie, Jerry around?"
S08E18,CONRAD,"No, and I prefer ""Conrad"". So I heard what happened to the desk."
S08E18,GEORGE,There was something so reassuring about that cozy little space.
S08E18,CONRAD,"Yeah, well, whatever. See ya'"
S08E18,JERRY,"Ah, back to normal. Not bad for four thousand bucks. . . . I can't believe I got the Low Fat!"
S08E19,GEORGE,"So, Marcy, you should've seen me in the hot tub yoday."
S08E19,MARCY,Why?
S08E19,GEORGE,I was naked.
S08E19,MARCY,"Oh, George."
S08E19,JERRY,I saw it.
S08E19,MARCY,How'd he look?
S08E19,JERRY,Okay. I wouldn't see it again.
S08E19,MARCY,"You know, a friend of mine thought she got Legonare's disease in the hot tub."
S08E19,GEORGE,Really? What happened?
S08E19,MARCY,"Oh, yada yada yada, just some bad egg salad. I'll be right back. (She gets up)"
S08E19,JERRY,"I noticed she's big on the phrase ""yada yada."""
S08E19,GEORGE,"Is ""yada yada"" bad?"
S08E19,JERRY,"No, ""yada yada"" is good. She's very succinct."
S08E19,GEORGE,She is succinct.
S08E19,JERRY,"Yeah, it's like you're dating USA Today. (Tim the dentist enters Monk's)"
S08E19,GEORGE,Hey.
S08E19,JERRY,"Hey, George, you know Tim Whatley."
S08E19,GEORGE,"Yeah, dentist of the stars."
S08E19,JERRY,What's up?
S08E19,TIM,I'll tell you what's up. I'm a Jew.
S08E19,JERRY,Excuse me?
S08E19,TIM,I'm a Jew. I finished converting two days ago.
S08E19,JERRY,Well... (Thinking of something to say) Welcome aboard.
S08E19,TIM,Thanks.
S08E19,GEORGE,"Hey, where you just at the health club?"
S08E19,TIM,"Oh, well, I didn't do much. I just sat in the sauna. You know, it was more like a Jewish workout. I'll see ya. (Jerry and George give confused looks)"
S08E19,JERRY,"Elaine, the guy's Jewish two days, he's already making Jewish jokes."
S08E19,ELAINE,"So what? When someone turns twenty-one, they usually get drunk the first night."
S08E19,JERRY,Booze is not a religion.
S08E19,ELAINE,"Tell that to my father. Anyway, guess what? Beth Lookner called me."
S08E19,JERRY,"Ooh. Beth Lookner, still waitin' out hat marriage."
S08E19,ELAINE,What are you talking about? That marriage ended six months ago. She's already remarried.
S08E19,JERRY,I gotta get on that internet. I'm late on everything.
S08E19,ELAINE,"Anyway, Beth and her new husband Arnie have listed me a reference for an adoption agency. They're trying to get a baby. (Kramer and Mickey enter wearing the same shirt)"
S08E19,KRAMER,"Elaine, all right, who looks better in this shirt? Me or Mickey?"
S08E19,MICKEY,"We're double dating tonight, and if we wear the same shirt we'll look like idiots."
S08E19,ELAINE,"Hmm, turn around. (They turn around) Both so striking."
S08E19,KRAMER,Tell me about it. We just picked up two women at the Gap.
S08E19,ELAINE,How did you decide which one of you would date which girl? (They pause then look at each other)
S08E19,MARCY,"So I'm on 3rd Avenue, mindin' my own business, and, yada yada yada, I get a free massage and a facial."
S08E19,GEORGE,What a succinct story.
S08E19,MARCY,I'm surprised you drive a Cadillac.
S08E19,GEORGE,"Oh, it's not mine. It's my mother's."
S08E19,MARCY,Are you close with your parents?
S08E19,GEORGE,"Well, they gave birth to me, and, yada yada..."
S08E19,MARCY,Yada what?
S08E19,GEORGE,Yada yada yada...
S08E19,KAREN,"(To Mickey, wearing the shirt Elaine looked at for them) I like your shirt."
S08E19,MICKEY,"Oh, thank you. It's 100 cotton, and some wool."
S08E19,KRAMER,"Well, you too seem to have the same taste."
S08E19,JULIE,"Well I like it, too."
S08E19,KRAMER,Well I have the same shirt.
S08E19,MICKEY,"Yeah, well I'm wearin' it."
S08E19,JULIE,I like your shirt too.
S08E19,KAREN,"Oh, so do I."
S08E19,KRAMER,Oh. (Waiter approaches table)
S08E19,WAITER,"Anything to drink? Some wine, perhaps."
S08E19,MICKEY,I like Merlot.
S08E19,KAREN,I love Merlot.
S08E19,JULIE,I'm crazy about Merlot.
S08E19,KRAMER,I live for Merlot.
S08E19,WAITER,We're out of Merlot.
S08E19,AGENT,"So you, uh, know Betha and Arnie pretty well?"
S08E19,ELAINE,"Oh, yeah, yeah."
S08E19,AGENT,Do you socialize with them often?
S08E19,ELAINE,"Yeah, we got out to dinner a lot. Usually Chinese, well sometimes Thai. And we go to the movies, Arnie's a real film buff."
S08E19,AGENT,Oh.
S08E19,ELAINE,"Actually, I remember this one time, um, this is funny. Um, we went to see the movie Striptease. I don't know if you've seen... doesn't matter. Anyway, I was whispering something to Beth, and Arnie leens over to me, and he goes, ""Would you SHUT UP?!"" I mean, he barely even knew me. Where did he get ah-- But they're nice people. (Elaine tries to smile realizing her mistake)"
S08E19,GEORGE,"Oh, you're in here."
S08E19,JERRY,What're you doing here?
S08E19,GEORGE,I knew you had an appointment.
S08E19,JERRY,Well this is very awkward.
S08E19,GEORGE,"I'll leave when the guy comes in. I gotta tell you, I am loving this yada yada thing. You know, I can cross over my whole life story. (Picks up dental tool)"
S08E19,JERRY,"Hey, you don't play with that. That's going in my mouth."
S08E19,GEORGE,"Hey, what this thing? Whew!"
S08E19,JERRY,"All right, that's enough. Now get going. Get outta here. (Tim and his staff enter)"
S08E19,GEORGE,"Hey, Tim. Quick question. Is it normal for your teeth to make noises, like a hissing or a chirping?"
S08E19,JERRY,George...
S08E19,TIM,Um...
S08E19,GEORGE,"Fine, I'll make an appointment. (He leaves)"
S08E19,TIM,"All right, it is cavity time. Ah, here we go. Which reminds me, did you here the one about the rabbi and the farmer's daughter? Huh?"
S08E19,JERRY,Hey.
S08E19,TIM,Those aren't mahtzah balls.
S08E19,JERRY,"Tim, do you think you should be making jokes like that?"
S08E19,TIM,"Why not? I'm Jewish, remember?"
S08E19,JERRY,"I know, but..."
S08E19,TIM,"Jerry, it's our sense of humor that sustained us as a people for 3000 years."
S08E19,JERRY,5000.
S08E19,TIM,"5000, even better. Okay, Chrissie. Give me a schtickle of flouride."
S08E19,JERRY,And then he asked the assistant for a schtickle of flouride.
S08E19,ELAINE,Why are you so concerned about this?
S08E19,JERRY,I'll tell you why. Because I believe Whatley converted to Judaism just for the jokes. (Phone rings)
S08E19,PHONE,Would you be interested in a subscription to the New York Times?
S08E19,JERRY,Yes. (Slams down phone. Kramer and Mickey enter)
S08E19,KRAMER,I don't believe that.
S08E19,MICKEY,If you had gotten into the backseat of the car we could've figured this whole thing out.
S08E19,KRAMER,Why were you holding the door open for?
S08E19,MICKEY,Not for you! Who holds a door open for a man?
S08E19,KRAMER,"Well, I thought it was a nice gesture. But I guess I was wrong!"
S08E19,MICKEY,Let's just put they're names in a hat.
S08E19,KRAMER,"I don't even know their names! Look, why don't you just take the one that was on the left?"
S08E19,MICKEY,I'm not sure she was my type.
S08E19,KRAMER,"Oh, everybody's your type."
S08E19,MICKEY,What the hell does that mean?
S08E19,KRAMER,You've been married three times.
S08E19,MICKEY,"That's it, it's go time! (Charges toward Kramer, only to be held back by Jerry and Elaine)"
S08E19,JERRY,"All right, take it easy."
S08E19,ELAINE,"Hey, hey, hey!"
S08E19,KRAMER,"Come on, let him go. You want throw? Let's throw!"
S08E19,ELAINE,"Hey! Hold on a second. All right, look, I got an idea. Why don't you just show up early for your next date, sit across from each other, and see who the girls sit next to."
S08E19,MICKEY,That's not bad.
S08E19,KRAMER,"All right, so we let the girls decide."
S08E19,MICKEY,"Yeah, why should we knock ourselves out?"
S08E19,KRAMER,"Yeah, I wanna wear that shirt next time."
S08E19,MICKEY,"No, no one wears the shirt next time."
S08E19,KRAMER,"That's right, 'cause they already saw it."
S08E19,MICKEY,We'll look like idiots. (They exit)
S08E19,GEORGE,"Well, we were engaged to be married, uh, we bought the wedding invitations, and, uh, yada yada yada, I'm still single."
S08E19,MARCY,So what's she doing now?
S08E19,GEORGE,Yada.
S08E19,MARCY,"Speaking of ex's, my old boyfriend came over late last night, and, yada yada yada, anyway. I'm really tired today."
S08E19,ELAINE,"Beth, Arnie, hi. What's up?"
S08E19,ARNIE,Well our adoption application was denied.
S08E19,ELAINE,Really.
S08E19,BETH,The adoption agent seems to feel that Arnie has a violent temper.
S08E19,ELAINE,Oh.
S08E19,BETH,So we're just asking our friends what they may have said to the adoption agent.
S08E19,ELAINE,"Uh, you know, I just told them what kind people you are and, uh, yada yada yada, that is it."
S08E19,JERRY,How you doing?
S08E19,FATHER,I have a discomfort in my molar. (Enter Tim)
S08E19,TIM,"Well, the Curtis, why don't you come in? (To Jerry) Father Curtis, good guy. Oh, which reminds me, did you hear the one about the Pope and Raquel Welch on the lifeboat, huh? I'll tell you later. (Exits)"
S08E19,JERRY,"Whatley. (Like ""Newman"")"
S08E19,KRAMER,What are they doing here?
S08E19,MICKEY,I told you we should've gotten here a half hour early.
S08E19,KRAMER,"All right, all right. Now what're we gonna do?"
S08E19,MICKEY,"All right, don't panic. Let's just decide now. Which one do you want?"
S08E19,KRAMER,"All right, I'll take Julie."
S08E19,MICKEY,I knew you wanted her. That's who I wanted.
S08E19,KRAMER,"All right, I'll take Karen."
S08E19,MICKEY,"No, no, you think I'm fallin' for that? I'll take Karen."
S08E19,KRAMER,"All right, which one is Julie? (They walk over to the table and fight over who sits where) Hey, you ladies look lovely tonight. (Continue to struggle)"
S08E19,JERRY,"So Whatley sayd to me, ""Hey, I can make Catholic jokes, I used to be Catholic."""
S08E19,ELAINE,"You see, I don't think it is a Catholic joke. I think it's more of a Raquel Welch joke. What was it? No, I said hand me the buoys. (Laughing) Bouys!"
S08E19,JERRY,"Don't you see what Whatley is after? Total joke telling immunity. He's already got the two big religions covered, if he ever gets Polish citizenship there'll be no stopping him."
S08E19,ELAINE,So what're you gonna do?
S08E19,JERRY,I think this Father Curtis might be very interested to hear what Whatley has the Pope doing with Raquel Welch.
S08E19,ELAINE,"(Calling on phone) Hey, Beth, Arnie, it's Elaine. Um, thought you guys might wanna have lunch. Gimme a call. Bye."
S08E19,JERRY,They're not getting a baby so you're taking them out to lunch?
S08E19,ELAINE,Thought it would be nice.
S08E19,JERRY,Poor Beth.
S08E19,ELAINE,"Hey, Arnie's just as upset."
S08E19,JERRY,Oh screw him! (George enters)
S08E19,GEORGE,"Listen to this. Marcy comes up and she tells me her ex-boyfriend was over late last night, and ""yada yada yada, I'm really tired today."" You don't think she yada yada'd sex."
S08E19,ELAINE,(Raising hand) I've yada yada'd sex.
S08E19,GEORGE,Really?
S08E19,ELAINE,"Yeah. I met this lawyer, we went out to dinner, I had the lobster bisk, we went back to my place, yada yada yada, I never heard from him again."
S08E19,JERRY,But you yada yada'd over the best part.
S08E19,ELAINE,"No, I mentioned the bisk."
S08E19,GEORGE,"Well, I gotta do somethin'. (Walks over to bathroom. Kramer enters)"
S08E19,KRAMER,"Well, I gotta do somethin'."
S08E19,JERRY,George is already in there.
S08E19,KRAMER,"(Confused) No, Mickey and I, we can't work it out. You know, I'm thinking of asking that Karen out by myself."
S08E19,JERRY,I thought you were leaning towards Julie.
S08E19,KRAMER,"I was, but the one I thought was Julie turned out to be Karen."
S08E19,GEORGE,Well it was a helluva yada yada.
S08E19,MARCY,"He's moving to Seattle. We wanted to say goodbye, I was just getting out of the shower, and yada yada yada--"
S08E19,GEORGE,"All right, enough! Enough! From now on, no more yada yada's. Just give me the full story."
S08E19,MARCY,Okay.
S08E19,GEORGE,Tell me about the free facial.
S08E19,MARCY,"Okay, well, like I said I was on 3rd Avenue, and I stopped by a large department store."
S08E19,GEORGE,Which one?
S08E19,MARCY,Bloomingdale's.
S08E19,GEORGE,Very good. Go on.
S08E19,MARCY,"Oh, and I stole a Piaget watch."
S08E19,GEORGE,What's that?
S08E19,MARCY,"And then, I was on such a... high, that I went upstairs to the salon on the fifth floor, and got a massage and facial, and skipped out on the bill."
S08E19,GEORGE,Shoplifting.
S08E19,MARCY,"Well, what about you? You told me that you were engaged. What was the rest of that? (Pause)"
S08E19,JERRY,"Excuse me, Mother?"
S08E19,NUN,Sister.
S08E19,JERRY,"Sister, right. Do you know when Father Curtis has office hours?"
S08E19,NUN,Well not until tomorrow.
S08E19,JERRY,"Hmm, I really need to speak with him."
S08E19,FATHER,That's a kneeler.
S08E19,JERRY,Oh. (Adjusts accordingly)
S08E19,FATHER,"Tell me your sins, my son."
S08E19,JERRY,Well I should tell you that I'm Jewish.
S08E19,FATHER,That's no sin.
S08E19,JERRY,"Oh good. Anyway, I wanted to talk to you about Dr. Whatley. I have a suspicion that he's converted to Judaism just for the jokes."
S08E19,FATHER,And this offends you as a Jewish person.
S08E19,JERRY,"No, it offends me as a comedian. And it'll interest you that he's also telling Catholic jokes."
S08E19,FATHER,Well.
S08E19,JERRY,"And they're old jokes. I mean, the Pope and Raquel Welch in a lifeboat."
S08E19,FATHER,I haven't heard that one.
S08E19,JERRY,"Oh, I'm sure you have. They're out on the ocean and, yada yada yada, and she says, ""Those aren't buoys."" (Father starts laughing) Father..."
S08E19,FATHER,"One second... Well, if it would make you feel better I could speak to Dr. Whatley. I have to go back and have a wisdom teeth removed."
S08E19,JERRY,You know the difference between a dentist and a sadist don't you?
S08E19,FATHER,Um...
S08E19,JERRY,Newer magazines.
S08E19,FATHER,Now if you'll excuse me. (Closes door. George enters confessional.)
S08E19,GEORGE,"Jerry, I gotta talk to you."
S08E19,KRAMER,Hi.
S08E19,KAREN,"Hi, Kramer."
S08E19,KRAMER,Got a minute?
S08E19,KAREN,"Uh, actually my parents are over, but, would you like to meet them?"
S08E19,KRAMER,Sure.
S08E19,KAREN,"(Parents enter and are little people like Mickey) Mom, Dad."
S08E19,KRAMER,Hi.
S08E19,ARNIE,"Elaine, I have to ask you something. What exactly happened down there?"
S08E19,ELAINE,"Well, I don't know. I mean, I talked to him and, blah blah blah, he asked about you guys and, da da da da da, more questions, bleh bleh bleh...."
S08E19,ARNIE,"All right, shut up!"
S08E19,ELAINE,Again you are telling me to shut up?
S08E19,ARNIE,What?
S08E19,ELAINE,You yelled that time at the movies. That's why you're not getting the baby.
S08E19,ARNIE,Oh my God. How am I gonna tell Beth?
S08E19,ELAINE,"Look, I'll go down and talk to this adoption guy and I'll make sure that it all gets worked out."
S08E19,ARNIE,"All right, just don't screw it up this time! (He exits)"
S08E19,ELAINE,"See, again with the yelling. Not a fan of the yelling."
S08E19,JERRY,"(In pain) Oh, are you about done?"
S08E19,TIM,I'm just getting warmed up. Because I'm just a sadist with newer magazines.
S08E19,JERRY,Huh?
S08E19,TIM,Father Curtis told me about your little joke.
S08E19,JERRY,What about all your Jewish jokes?
S08E19,TIM,"I'm Jewish, you're not a dentist. You have no idea what my people have been through."
S08E19,JERRY,The Jews?
S08E19,TIM,"No, the dentists. You know, we have the highest suicide rate of any profession?"
S08E19,JERRY,Is that why it's so hard to get an appointment?
S08E19,KRAMER,"So, I'll uh... all right. (Hangs up)"
S08E19,JERRY,Date with Karen?
S08E19,KRAMER,"No, Julie. She's the one."
S08E19,JERRY,What happened to Karen?
S08E19,KRAMER,"Well, Mickey and her have a lot more in common. you know her parents are little people?"
S08E19,JERRY,"Oh, small world. So little people can have not little people children?"
S08E19,KRAMER,"Oh yeah, and vice versa. Mother Nature's a mad scientist, Jerry."
S08E19,JERRY,So you won't believe what happened with Whatley today. It got back to hime that I made this little dentist joke and he got all offended. Those people can be so touchy.
S08E19,KRAMER,"Those people, listen to yourself."
S08E19,JERRY,What?
S08E19,KRAMER,"You think that dentists are so different from me and you? They came to this country just like everybody else, in search of a dream."
S08E19,JERRY,"Kramer, he's just a dentist."
S08E19,KRAMER,"Yeah, and you're an anti-dentite."
S08E19,JERRY,I am not an anti-dentite!
S08E19,KRAMER,"You're a rabid anti-dentite! Oh, it starts with a few jokes and some slurs. ""Hey, denty!"" Next thing you know you're saying they should have their own schools."
S08E19,JERRY,They do have their own schools!
S08E19,KRAMER,Yeah!
S08E19,ELAINE,"One little baby, whatever you have in stock."
S08E19,AENT,Miss Benes...
S08E19,ELAINE,"Look it, look it, Ryan. These people are gettin' a baby. Period. Now we can do this the easy way, or we can do this the fun way."
S08E19,BETH,"Jerry, I'm sorry to bother you, but you always said you'd be there for me."
S08E19,JERRY,"Well, what's wrong?"
S08E19,BETH,I'm thinking of leaving Arnie.
S08E19,JERRY,Talk to me.
S08E19,BETH,"He met with Elaine, and I asked him what happened, and he yada yada'd me. I mean, could he be having an affair?"
S08E19,JERRY,"Well, I wouldn't put anything past anybody."
S08E19,BETH,But we just got married.
S08E19,JERRY,Well obviously that was a mistake. You need to forget about Arnie. The important thing is you're moving on.
S08E19,BETH,Why would Elaine do that to me?
S08E19,JERRY,"Forget about Elaine. Let's just focus on us. Come on, big hug. (Mickey and Karen enter)"
S08E19,MICKEY,Hey Jerry. Where's Kramer? I've got exciting news.
S08E19,JERRY,I'm kinda in the middle of something.
S08E19,MICKEY,Karen and I are getting married.
S08E19,JERRY,"Oh, congratulations. Her marriage just fell apart."
S08E19,MICKEY,(To Beth) How many is that for you?
S08E19,BETH,Two.
S08E19,MICKEY,"You're a lightweight. Come on, honey."
S08E19,ELAINE,Hey Jerry. What are you doing here with Beth?
S08E19,JERRY,Beth and Arnie broke up.
S08E19,ELAINE,So they don't want a baby?
S08E19,JERRY,(Shaking his head no) Pff.
S08E19,ELAINE,(Realizes her mistake) I think I'm gonna be sick. (George enters alone)
S08E19,JERRY,"Hey, where's Marcy?"
S08E19,GEORGE,"She, uh, went shopping for some shoes for the wedding and, yada yada yada, I'll see her in six to eight months. (Kramer and Julie enter)"
S08E19,JERRY,"Hey, Kramer, over here."
S08E19,KRAMER,I just assume not sit next to you.
S08E19,JERRY,"Kramer... Oh look, there's Mickey and his parents."
S08E19,ELAINE,Nice looking family.
S08E19,JERRY,Very handsome.
S08E19,KRAMER,(To Mr. Abbott) How ya doing?
S08E19,MR. ABBOTT,Hey Kramer.
S08E19,JULIE,"Oh Mickey. Excuse me, I can't take this. (She exits quickly)"
S08E19,JERRY,"Hi, Mr. Abbott."
S08E19,MR. ABBOTT,"That's Dr. Abbott, D.D.S. Tim Whatley was one of my students. And if this wasn't my son's wedding day, I'd knock you teeth out you anti-dentite bastard."
S08E19,BETH,What was that all about?
S08E19,JERRY,"Oh, I said something about dentists and it got blown all out of proportion."
S08E19,BETH,"Hey, what do you call a doctor who fails out of med school?"
S08E19,JERRY,What?
S08E19,BETH,A dentist. (They laugh)
S08E19,JERRY,That's a good one. Dentists.
S08E19,BETH,"Yeah, who needs 'em? Not to mention the Blacks and the Jews. (Jerry fakes a smile)"
S08E19,ELAINE,Where's Beth?
S08E19,JERRY,She went out to get her head shaved.
S08E19,FATHER,We are gathered her today to unite this couple in holy... matrimony.
S08E19,JERRY,Those wisdom teeth are tough to get out.
S08E19,FATHER,"Marriage is not an intervention to be entered lightly... Yada yada yada, I pronounce you man and wife. (They kiss, walk toward exit)"
S08E19,KAREN,(To Kramer) I really wanted you.
S08E20,ELAINE,"Uh, excuse me."
S08E20,GLADYS,"Be with you in a minute. (turns her back to Elaine and continues into phone) No, you shoulda come last night, it was fun."
S08E20,ELAINE,"Uhm, I just have a question."
S08E20,GLADYS,"(into phone) I know, the margaritas in that place are so strong."
S08E20,ELAINE,(walks up to counter) Helloo? I'd like to buy these hirachis.
S08E20,GLADYS,(into phone) So? What else is goin' on?
S08E20,ELAINE,(shouts) HEY!!
S08E20,GLADYS,"Listen, I'll call you back. (to Elaine) Yes? What can I do for you?"
S08E20,ELAINE,"(tosses the hirachis onto the counter) Nothing. You, just lost a customer."
S08E20,VALERIE,Ready to go? I don't wanna miss the previews.
S08E20,JERRY,"Me neither. I love the previews. In fact I enjoy being in the theatre cut up(?). Last week after a preview, I yelled out 'Must miss'."
S08E20,VALERIE,"I think that I was in that theatre. That, that was really funny."
S08E20,JERRY,"Yeah, it got a good laugh. Let me just check my messages before we go."
S08E20,GEORGE,So you're on the speed dial?
S08E20,JERRY,After two dates!
S08E20,GEORGE,What number?
S08E20,JERRY,Seven.
S08E20,GEORGE,"Wha! You know, it's a pain to change that. You gotta lift up that plastic thing with a pen."
S08E20,KRAMER,"Uh, hey buddy."
S08E20,JERRY,Hey.
S08E20,KRAMER,It all right if I keep these here for a while? I'm having a New Year's Eve party.
S08E20,JERRY,You're gonna keep these here for eight months?!
S08E20,KRAMER,"No, Jerry. New Year's Eve nineteen ninety-nine. The millennium. I told you about that."
S08E20,JERRY,"Kramer, you're gonna leave these chairs here for two and a half years?!"
S08E20,KRAMER,You're not gonna see 'em. I got a case of party poppers I'm gonna keep in front of 'em.
S08E20,GEORGE,"Hey, so get this. I get a call this morning from one of the Mets front office guys. They wanna take me out to lunch."
S08E20,JERRY,What for?
S08E20,GEORGE,"(smiling) I'm on a winning ball club, Jerry. They probably wanna pick my brains."
S08E20,JERRY,"Really, why d'you think they're taking you out to lunch?"
S08E20,GEORGE,(thoughtful) I have no idea.
S08E20,ELAINE,"Alright, I have had it with those Mayans."
S08E20,JERRY,I don't mind the Mayans.
S08E20,ELAINE,"(unfolding chair) You know that store, Putumayo? (sits) I was trying to buy these hirachis, right, and the saleswoman just completely ignored me."
S08E20,KRAMER,"What, we talking hirachis? I know a great store for hirachis."
S08E20,ELAINE,"No, no, not Putumayo."
S08E20,KRAMER,"No, no. Cinqo de Mayo. (leaving) Yeah, Marcellino, he turned me on to it, and he's one sixty-fourth Mayan."
S08E20,GEORGE,"(slightly worried) You know, I'm starting to get a little nervous about this lunch."
S08E20,ELAINE,What'd you have?
S08E20,KRAMER,"Yeah, I'm gonna keep these here too, huh? They'll be alright. (begins to leave)"
S08E20,JERRY,"Kramer, these balloons aren't gonna stay filled till New Year's!"
S08E20,KRAMER,"(at the door) Well, those aren't for New Year's. Those are my everyday balloons."
S08E20,MINKLER,"George, we'll be blunt. The Mets need somebody to head up scouting, and we think that someone might be you."
S08E20,GEORGE,(surprise) Head of scouting?
S08E20,MOONEY,Interested?
S08E20,GEORGE,(playing it cool) I'm still here.
S08E20,MINKLER,"Now, unfortunately, league rules prevent us from making you an offer while you're still under contract."
S08E20,MOONEY,You understand what we're talking about?
S08E20,GEORGE,So you're talking...
S08E20,MINKLER,"No, no."
S08E20,MOONEY,"We're *not* talking. We're just, talking."
S08E20,GEORGE,"So, you need me to get fired."
S08E20,MINKLER,We didn't say that.
S08E20,MOONEY,"We couldn't say that, because even if we did..."
S08E20,MINKLER,...we couldn't say that we said it.
S08E20,MOONEY,You see what we're saying?
S08E20,GEORGE,(jokingly) You are still paying for this lunch?
S08E20,MINKLER,(serious) We didn't say that.
S08E20,JERRY,Hi. Sorry I'm late. There's a lotta chairs and balloons in my apartment. How 'bout I make it up to you with dinner?
S08E20,VALERIE,(pointedly) Someplace nice this time?
S08E20,JERRY,"Yeah, I'm sorry about that Mongolian barbecue last night. I'd heard good things."
S08E20,VALERIE,"(rising) I don't know, got a two in Zagat's."
S08E20,JERRY,Lemme just check my messages. (to himself) Maybe a nicer girl called.
S08E20,VOICE (O.C.),Hello?
S08E20,JERRY,Hello? Who's this?
S08E20,VOICE (O.C.),Jane. What number did you dial?
S08E20,JERRY,Seven?
S08E20,ELAINE,"Hey! See these? (raises her foot so her new hirachis can be seen) Cinqo de Mayo! Sales commission, bye-bye-o! (waves)"
S08E20,GEORGE (O.C.),(singing) Meet the Mets...
S08E20,GEORGE,...meet the Mets. Come on in and greet the Mets.
S08E20,JERRY,Good meeting?
S08E20,GEORGE,"There was no meeting. (gets one of the folding chairs) But it was quite a meeting. You are looking at the next director of Mets scouting. The only thing is, I have to get fired from the Yankees first."
S08E20,JERRY,You can do that.
S08E20,GEORGE,"Of course. But I really wanna leave my mark this time, you know, uh. I wanna walk away from the Yankees with people saying 'Wow! Now that guy got canned!'"
S08E20,JERRY,So you want to go out in a final blaze of incompetence?
S08E20,GEORGE,Ehh. (nostalgic) Remember that summer at Dairy Queen where I cooled my feet in the soft-serve machine?
S08E20,KRAMER,You think people will still be using napkins in the year two-thousand? Or is this mouth-vacuum thing for real?
S08E20,JERRY,"So, George..."
S08E20,GEORGE,Yeah.
S08E20,JERRY,"(rising) I had like a so-so date with Valerie, now I'm number nine on the speed-dial."
S08E20,GEORGE,So?
S08E20,JERRY,So? I used to be seven. I dropped two spots.
S08E20,GEORGE,"What, she's ranking you?"
S08E20,JERRY,"Yeah, this speed-dial's like a relationship barometer."
S08E20,GEORGE,What is a barometer exactly?
S08E20,KRAMER,It's pronounced thermometer.
S08E20,KRAMER,"You know, in the year two-thousand, we'll all be on speed-dial. You'll just have to think of a person, they'll be talking to you. It'll be like, wup (judders and puts his hands to his temples, as if receiving a call on a 'mental phone') getting a call here."
S08E20,KRAMER,"(to Jerry and George) Hey, it's Newman. (to 'mental phone') Hey, how you doing, Newman?"
S08E20,KRAMER,"(to 'mental phone') Oh, you wanna talk to Jerry?"
S08E20,VALERIE,"(pleased) Oh, flowers. You didn't have to do that. I mean, the dinner, and the play, and the hansom cab ride."
S08E20,JERRY,"Well, I just wanted to... (breaks off) You forgot the gift certificate to Barnes and Noble."
S08E20,VALERIE,Oh.
S08E20,JERRY,"(resumes) ...you know, make a good impression."
S08E20,VALERIE,I'm gonna go put these in some water.
S08E20,JERRY,I like the way you think.
S08E20,JERRY,"Oh my God! Number one!! Seinfeld, you magnificent bastard!"
S08E20,GEORGE,"Sorry I'm late, but look what I found in the Yankee Hall of Pride display case."
S08E20,WILHELM,Isn't that Babe Ruth's uniform?
S08E20,GEORGE,Is it? (reaches into bag)
S08E20,GEORGE,"Huh, strawberries, anyone? (eats a strawberry) Ah, that's good. Ooh, juicy this time of year."
S08E20,GEORGE,Gotta get the good ones.
S08E20,GEORGE,"Oh, that's bad. That's bad."
S08E20,KRAMER,"So Jerry, my millennium party's really coming together. Will people be able to breathe underwater in the year two-thousand?"
S08E20,JERRY,Some of us.
S08E20,KRAMER,(crumpling a piece of paper) I don't wanna exclude anybody.
S08E20,JERRY,Hola.
S08E20,ELAINE,Shove it!
S08E20,JERRY,What is all this?
S08E20,ELAINE,"I got all this junk at Cinqo de Mayo, because I was trying to show Putumayo how much business they'd lost. I mean, I been dancing (demonstrates dance) and strutting in front of their store for two days."
S08E20,JERRY,"Ah, no wonder we're getting so much rain."
S08E20,KRAMER,"Elaine, I'm having a millennium party, so save the date."
S08E20,ELAINE,"Hey, you know what? Newman sent me an invitation already, to his party."
S08E20,KRAMER,Newman?
S08E20,ELAINE,Yeah.
S08E20,KRAMER,"(reads) Come celebrate the millennium, with Newmanniun. Newman!"
S08E20,JERRY,Hi Valerie.
S08E20,JERRY,You're not Valerie.
S08E20,MRS HAMILTON,I'm her step-mother. Drive.
S08E20,MRS HAMILTON,"It's taken me thirteen years to climb up to the top of that speed-dial, and I don't intend to lose my spot to you."
S08E20,JERRY,"But, I never..."
S08E20,MRS HAMILTON,(threatening) You just stay away from that phone.
S08E20,GEORGE,"You wanted to see me, sir?"
S08E20,STEINBRENNER,I heard about what happened at the meeting this morning...
S08E20,GEORGE,"Oh, yes. I already packed up my desk, sir. I can be outta here in an hour."
S08E20,STEINBRENNER,"...and I have to tell you, it's exactly what this organisation needed."
S08E20,STEINBRENNER,"We wanna look to the future, we gotta tear down the past. Babe Ruth was nothing more than a fat old man, with little-girl legs. And here's something I just found out recently. He wasn't really a sultan. Ah, what d'you make of that? Hey, check this out. (he stands to reveal he's wearing baseball pants) Lou Gehrig's pants. Not a bad fit. (a thought occurs) Hey, you don't think that nerve disease of his was contagious, do you? Uh, I better take 'em off. I'm too important to this team. (removes the pants to reveal his boxers) Big Stein can't be flopping and twitching."
S08E20,STEINBRENNER,"Hey, how 'bout some lunch. What're you going for?"
S08E20,JERRY,"You know uh, Valerie, I uh, couldn't help but notice that I'm on your speed-dial."
S08E20,VALERIE,You deserve it.
S08E20,JERRY,"But I can't help thinking that maybe there's someone in your life who deserves it more. Someone you've known, you know, more than a week."
S08E20,VALERIE,"My stepmother got to you, didn't she?"
S08E20,JERRY,What? No.
S08E20,VALERIE,"Uuh, I can't believe she did this again. That's it! She's off the speed-dial completely!"
S08E20,JERRY,Yikes!
S08E20,KRAMER,"Well, I just got your invitation to the Newmanniun party."
S08E20,NEWMAN,"You just got it? Damn, the mail is slow."
S08E20,KRAMER,"(getting worked up) You knew I was having a millennium party, but you just had to throw yours on the same day!"
S08E20,NEWMAN,I have done nothing unethical.
S08E20,KRAMER,"Yeah, well you're gonna have to cancel it, because I've told everybody about my party."
S08E20,NEWMAN,"Cancel! (jumps to feet) Think again, longshanks! I started planning this in nineteen seventy-eight. I put a deposit down on that revolving restaurant that overlooks Times Square, and I booked Christopher Cross."
S08E20,KRAMER,"(worked up) Well, what am I gonna do? I got over two hundred folding chairs, and quite a bit of ice."
S08E20,NEWMAN,(thoughtful) What kind?
S08E20,KRAMER,Cubed.
S08E20,NEWMAN,"That's good stuff, and you can never have too much ice. Alright, I'll tell you what I'll do. You can co-host the party with me, under one condition. No Jerry. Jerry is not invited."
S08E20,KRAMER,I gotta invite Jerry. He's my buddy.
S08E20,NEWMAN,"That he may be. But he's outta my life, starting in the year two-thousand. For me, the next millennium must be, Jerry-free!"
S08E20,JERRY,How could they not fire you?
S08E20,GEORGE,Never thought I'd fail at failing.
S08E20,JERRY,"Aw, come on there now."
S08E20,GEORGE,(depressed) Feel like I can't do anything wrong.
S08E20,JERRY,Nonsense. You do everything wrong.
S08E20,GEORGE,(hopeful) Everything?
S08E20,JERRY,Everything.
S08E20,GEORGE,You really think so?
S08E20,JERRY,Absolutely. I have no confidence in you.
S08E20,GEORGE,"Alright. I guess I just have to pick myself up, dust myself off, and throw myself right back down again!"
S08E20,JERRY,That's the spirit. You suck!
S08E20,GEORGE,(pleased) I know.
S08E20,ELAINE,"No, no, no no, listen to me. I work in fashion. Together, we can drive Putumayo outta business and make Cinqo de Mayo numero uno... de Mayo."
S08E20,GLADYS,Do you need some help with something?
S08E20,ELAINE,(puzzled) You? What're you doing here?
S08E20,GLADYS,I own this store.
S08E20,ELAINE,No you don't. You own Putumayo. Unless you own both stores. (laughs nervously)
S08E20,GLADYS,I'm Gladys Mayo.
S08E20,ELAINE,"Ah, this really sticks in my craw."
S08E20,JERRY,"Well, Mrs Hamilton, it's certainly nice that you and Valerie patched things up, so we could all get together like this. Where is Valerie?"
S08E20,MRS HAMILTON,"I'm sure she'll be along. (handing over a glass) Have some wine, Jerome."
S08E20,JERRY,Okay.
S08E20,MRS HAMILTON,"You know Jerome, I can understand what Valerie sees in you. So attractive, so strong, so comedic."
S08E20,JERRY,"Uh, good."
S08E20,MRS HAMILTON,"Jerome, I have a deliciously naughty idea."
S08E20,JERRY,(nervous) What?
S08E20,MRS HAMILTON,Why don't I put you on my speed-dial?
S08E20,JERRY,"I don't know, Mrs Hamilton. That doesn't sound..."
S08E20,MRS HAMILTON,"Don't be such a child, Jerome. How's number three sound?"
S08E20,JERRY,"Valerie's not coming over, is she?"
S08E20,MRS HAMILTON,"Seven, four..."
S08E20,JERRY,No...
S08E20,MRS HAMILTON,Two...
S08E20,JERRY,"Stop, stop. This isn't right. What about Valerie?"
S08E20,MRS HAMILTON,I won't tell if you don't.
S08E20,JERRY,(leaving hurriedly) Wuhh...
S08E20,KRAMER,Jerry... Newman... Two-thousand...
S08E20,KRAMER,(yells) Newmanniun!!
S08E20,KRAMER,(whimper) Jerry?
S08E20,KOREN (O.C.),"Alright, Yankees, two. Orioles, nothing. Wait a minute! A short stocky bald man is streaking across the field."
S08E20,JERRY,"Oh my God, George!"
S08E20,KOREN (O.C.),"Check that. He's not streaking. He's wearing a flesh-tone body-stocking. Apparently, he's a bit bashful, and oddly, no-one seems upset."
S08E20,JERRY,"Kramer, look, it's George."
S08E20,KOREN (O.C.),Everyone loves him.
S08E20,KRAMER,"Yeah, yeah, I know. (he clicks off the TV) Listen, Jerry, I can't let you come to my New Year's party."
S08E20,JERRY,(neutral) Fine.
S08E20,KRAMER,"(agitated) I mean, it's killing me! Newman's got the jump on the invites, and will crush me if I try to go it alone!"
S08E20,JERRY,(neutral) No problem.
S08E20,KRAMER,"(swung by Jerry's argument) You're right. I won't do it without you. I feel so ashamed I even thought of it, huh."
S08E20,KRAMER,"(pleading) Elaine, you can't go to Newman's Newmanniun."
S08E20,ELAINE,(neutral) Okay.
S08E20,KRAMER,"No, no, no. You gotta spend New Year's nineteen ninety-nine with me and Jerry."
S08E20,ELAINE,(neutral) Fine.
S08E20,KRAMER,(frustrated shout) Oh come on!!
S08E20,ELAINE,(neutral) Alright.
S08E20,KRAMER,"(triumph) Yesss! Alright, so it's you, it's me, and it's Jerry, huh. (claps hands) Yeah, now things are starting to snowball, huh. I'll tell Newman I don't need him. So, I'll uh, see you two in the twenty-first century."
S08E20,ELAINE,"(following Kramer to the door) Okay. Kramer, Kramer, wait a minute. Do you still have that pricing-gun?"
S08E20,KRAMER,Yeah.
S08E20,ELAINE,"Okay, I need you to help me put Putumayo outta business."
S08E20,KRAMER,Can do.
S08E20,JERRY,What're you doing with a pricing-gun?
S08E20,ELAINE,That place is about to have the sale of the century. Nothing over ninety-nine cents.
S08E20,JERRY,(to himself) Still a rip-off.
S08E20,JERRY,Hello?
S08E20,VALERIE,"Jerry, I was just at my stepmom's house, and I saw that you were on her speed-dial."
S08E20,JERRY,"Uh, well, she uh, probably just wanted to be able to keep tabs on you."
S08E20,JERRY,Hold on a second.
S08E20,JERRY,Hello?
S08E20,MRS HAMILTON,(seductive) Hi Jerome.
S08E20,JERRY,"Oh, Mrs Hamilton, this is a very bad time. I've got Valerie on the other line. Just a second."
S08E20,JERRY,Hello?
S08E20,VALERIE,"That's her on the other line, isn't it?"
S08E20,JERRY,Well...
S08E20,VALERIE,Tell her I don't want you on her speed-dial.
S08E20,JERRY,Hang on.
S08E20,JERRY,"She knows about the speed-dial. Mrs Hamilton, you gotta get me off this thing."
S08E20,MRS HAMILTON,"I won't, until she puts me back on hers."
S08E20,JERRY,Hang on.
S08E20,JERRY,She wants to be back on yours.
S08E20,VALERIE,Fine. But only if you're off hers.
S08E20,JERRY,Hang on.
S08E20,JERRY,"Fine, if I'm off yours."
S08E20,VALERIE,"No, still me."
S08E20,JERRY,Sorry. Hang on.
S08E20,JERRY,"Fine, if I'm off yours."
S08E20,MRS HAMILTON,"I won't do it. It's my speed-dial, and I don't trust her."
S08E20,JERRY,"Please, Mrs Hamilton, this is very awkward for me."
S08E20,MRS HAMILTON,(conspiratorial) Alright. I'll hide you in one of the emergency buttons.
S08E20,JERRY,"(hurried) Great, bye."
S08E20,JERRY,She said she'll do it.
S08E20,VALERIE,Great.
S08E20,JERRY,Hang on.
S08E20,JERRY,Hello?
S08E20,GEORGE,Jerry. I can't get fired.
S08E20,FAN,"Hey, body-suit man. 's up?"
S08E20,FAN,"(pointing) Hey, body-suit man."
S08E20,KRAMER,"Hi, I'm H.E. Pennypacker. I'm a wealthy American industrialist uh, looking to open a silver mine in the mountains of Peru and uh, before I invest millions in a lucrative mine, I, I'd like to go a little native. Uh, Get the feel of their condiments, of their unmentionables, you know, the real uh, gritty-gritty."
S08E20,GLADYS,"Well, lemme show you what we have."
S08E20,KRAMER,"Well uh, I think I can just browse around on my own."
S08E20,KRAMER,"(re the chips) Hmm, Macchu Picchu. Are these free?"
S08E20,GLADYS,Yeah.
S08E20,KRAMER,Hmm-mmm.
S08E20,GLADYS,Some of those are women's clothes.
S08E20,KRAMER,"Oh, not a problem."
S08E20,GEORGE,"Attention Steinbrenner and front-office morons! Your triumphs mean nothing. You all stink. You can sit on it, and rotate! This is George Costanza. I fear no reprisal. Extension five-one-seven-oh."
S08E20,KRAMER,L'Occupado.
S08E20,ELAINE,"Come on, what is taking you so long?"
S08E20,KRAMER,"Elaine, I broke the price-gun, so I had to move to plan B."
S08E20,ELAINE,Plan B? There is no plan B.
S08E20,KRAMER,(holds up some small white sachets) I took these out of every single garment in the store.
S08E20,ELAINE,What?!
S08E20,KRAMER,"They're dessicates. See, they absorb moisture. (gleeful) These clothes won't last five years without 'em."
S08E20,ELAINE,That's not gonna do anything.
S08E20,KRAMER,Patience.
S08E20,ELAINE,Alright. Forget it!
S08E20,KRAMER,What?
S08E20,ELAINE,"You have screwed me again, Pennypacker!"
S08E20,GLADYS,"Ladies, care for some chips?"
S08E20,KRAMER,"(emerging from the changing room) Well, I don't mind if I do."
S08E20,KRAMER,"Well, I've uh, I've changed my mind. I think I'm going to build a rollercoaster instead."
S08E20,STEINBRENNER,"I heard what you did in the parking lot, big boy, and it is in-excuse-a-bull. You personally insulted me, my staff... I cannot believe that you, body-suit man, could perpetrate such a disloyalty. Breaks my heart to say it... Oh, who am I kidding? I love it. You're fi..."
S08E20,WILHELM,"Wait, wait, Mr Steinbrenner. George doesn't deserve any of the blame for what happened in the parking lot today, sir. If there's anyone to blame here, it's me."
S08E20,STEINBRENNER,"What're you talking about, Wilhelm. You popping pills? You got the crazies again?"
S08E20,WILHELM,"No, no. No, no, sir. I ordered George to drive around insulting people today. Because I'm tired of all your macho head games."
S08E20,GEORGE,"(agitated) He's lying, sir! I'm tired of all your macho head games!"
S08E20,STEINBRENNER,Macho head games?
S08E20,WILHELM,"(puts arm round George's shoulder) He's just being loyal to me, sir."
S08E20,STEINBRENNER,"Wilhelm, you're fired. I owe you an apology, body-suit man. Streak on. (rising) Now, if you gentlemen'll excuse me, I'm not going to the game today, I'm gonna go outside and scalp some tickets. (heads toward the door) Owner's box, that's gotta bring in forty bucks, no problem."
S08E20,GEORGE,"Mr Wilhelm, what was that?!"
S08E20,WILHELM,"I wanted to get fired. George, you are looking at the new head scout of the New York Mets."
S08E20,WILHELM,"(singing) Meet the Mets, meet the Mets. Come right out and greet the Mets."
S08E20,KRAMER,"I don't know what Elaine is so upset about. I mean, without dessicates, those clothes'll be noticeably musty in five years."
S08E20,JERRY,She never sees the big picture.
S08E20,JERRY,"Hello, Newman!"
S08E20,NEWMAN,Hello Jerry. (to Kramer) What did you say to Elaine? I just got her cancellation in the mail.
S08E20,KRAMER,"Oh, well I guess she found some place better to go."
S08E20,NEWMAN,"Well, it's her mistake. Because she is going to miss the party of a lifetime."
S08E20,KRAMER,"Well, maybe so, but come midnight, when she's looking for someone warm and cuddly to kiss, I guess you'll be caught between the moon and New York City."
S08E20,NEWMAN,"Alright. Come back to my party, please."
S08E20,KRAMER,"Jerry too, of course."
S08E20,NEWMAN,"(reluctant) You don't wanna do your... act, or anything, do you?"
S08E20,JERRY,No.
S08E20,NEWMAN,"Alright then, I guess I can accept a little Jerry, if it gets me a (suggestive) lot of Elaine."
S08E20,KRAMER,Deal?
S08E20,NEWMAN,To the Newmanniun! (holds out his hand)
S08E20,KRAMER,(grasps Newman's hand) To the Kramennium.
S08E20,JERRY,"By the way Newman, I'm just curious. When you booked the hotel, did you book it for the millennium New Year?"
S08E20,NEWMAN,"(smug) As a matter of fact, I did."
S08E20,JERRY,"Oh, that's interesting, because as everyone knows, since there was no year zero, the millennium doesn't begin until the year two-thousand and one. Which would make your party, one year late, and thus, quite lame."
S08E20,JERRY,Aww!
S08E20,MRS HAMILTON,I don't feel well at all. I feel all dried-out inside.
S08E20,VALERIE,I'll call for help.
S08E20,JERRY,Hello?
S08E20,VALERIE,Who's this?
S08E20,JERRY,It's Jerry. Who's this?
S08E20,VALERIE,"Uh, it's Valerie."
S08E20,JERRY,"Oh, hi Valerie. What's up?"
S08E20,VALERIE,"I'll tell you what's up. My stepmother is violently ill, so I hit the button for poison control and I get you!"
S08E20,JERRY,"Wow, poison control? That's even higher than number one!"
S08E20,JERRY,Hello?
S08E21,JERRY,Hang on just let me pick up a paper.
S08E21,MAN,Excuse me. Would you mind watching my bag for a minute?
S08E21,GEORGE,Yeah. No problem.
S08E21,JERRY,Let's go.
S08E21,GEORGE,"Woah, I gotta watch this guy's bag."
S08E21,JERRY,For how long?
S08E21,GEORGE,I'm sure he'll be back in a second.
S08E21,JERRY,Come on.
S08E21,GEORGE,Excuse me sir. Would you mind watching my bag for a minute?
S08E21,MAN 2,Why? So I can stand here like an idiot not knowing if you'll ever come back?
S08E21,GEORGE,Where are you going?
S08E21,JERRY,I'm going to be this guy's friend.
S08E21,JERRY,New clothes?
S08E21,GEORGE,Yeah. I did some shopping. Some new clothes shopping. (turns to a man) Can I borrow your menu?
S08E21,JERRY,"Strange. For new pants, there's noticable wear on the buttocks of those chinos. Wait those are the clothes from the bag!"
S08E21,GEORGE,The guy never came back.
S08E21,JERRY,He asked you to watch them not wear them.
S08E21,GEORGE,I'm still watching them.
S08E21,JERRY,You look like a tourist.
S08E21,GEORGE,"All right, let me ask you something When do you start to worry about ear hair?"
S08E21,JERRY,When you hear like a soft russeling.
S08E21,GEORGE,"It's like puberty that never stops. Ear puberty, nose puberty, knuckle puberty, you gotta be vigilent. Let me ask you this Do you know where Walker Street is downtown? I've got a league meeting there."
S08E21,JERRY,"Oh right, the new job, how is it?"
S08E21,GEORGE,"I love it. New office, new salary. I'm the new Wilhelm."
S08E21,JERRY,So who's the new you?
S08E21,GEORGE,They got a new intern from Francis Louis High. His name is Keith. He comes in Mondays after school.
S08E21,JERRY,Oh hi Alex.
S08E21,ALEX,I'm sorry I'm late. Have you ordered yet?
S08E21,JERRY,No.
S08E21,ALEX,I'll be right back.
S08E21,GEORGE,Where are you meeting these women? When they get off the bus at the port authority?
S08E21,JERRY,"Right here, George. In here. (pointing to his chest) Try opening this up. You'll find the biggest dating scene in the world."
S08E21,GEORGE,Thanks. Thanks a lot.
S08E21,KRAMER,Hey.
S08E21,ELAINE,Hey.
S08E21,KRAMER,Hi.
S08E21,ELAINE,Where's Jerry?
S08E21,KRAMER,Well he's in the shower. You want me to get him?
S08E21,ELAINE,No. No no. Actually I kind of need to speak to you.
S08E21,KRAMER,Well let's sit down.
S08E21,ELAINE,"Kramer, ahem, remember that whole deal with you selling Peterman your stories for his book and then he gave them back to you?"
S08E21,KRAMER,Vaguely.
S08E21,ELAINE,"Well I was kind of, hehehe, short on material and I, um, I put them in the book anyway."
S08E21,KRAMER,You put my life's stories in his autobiography?
S08E21,ELAINE,"Kramer listen, it is such a stupid book. It doesn't matter."
S08E21,KRAMER,"Oh no. Sure. It matters. Wow. I've broken through, huh. I'm part of popular culture now. Listen I've got to thank Mr. Peterman."
S08E21,ELAINE,He's doing a book signing at Waldenbooks this afternoon.
S08E21,KRAMER,Waldenbooks? That's a major chain huh.
S08E21,KRAMER,"He Jerry, I'm going to waldenbooks."
S08E21,JERRY,(yelling) Get out! Get out! I don't want to live like this.
S08E21,KRAMER,"All right, let's go."
S08E21,ELAINE,"Mr. Lippman, how are you?"
S08E21,MR. LIPPMAN,Well I'm not bad. Not bad.
S08E21,ELAINE,What are you doing here?
S08E21,MR. LIPPMAN,I work for Pundant Publishishing. This is our book.
S08E21,ELAINE,Oh.
S08E21,MR. LIPPMAN,If you can call it that. Why is it every half-wit and sitcom star has his own book out now?
S08E21,KRAMER,Hey buddy. Remember me?
S08E21,MR. PETERMAN,You're that gangly fellow we bought the stories from.
S08E21,KRAMER,"Yeah, I'm just here to do my part. What's your name darling?"
S08E21,WOMAN,Who are you?
S08E21,KRAMER,I'm the real Peterman.
S08E21,MR. PETERMAN,All right playtime's over.
S08E21,KRAMER,Relax man. There's enough juice here to keep us all fat and giggley.
S08E21,WOMAN,I can't believe somebody pulled the top off of this muffin.
S08E21,ELAINE,That was me. I'm sorry. I don't like the stumps.
S08E21,MR. LIPPMAN,So you just eat the tops.
S08E21,ELAINE,"Oh yeah. It's the best part. It's crunchy, it's explosive, it's where the muffin breaks free of the pan and sort of (makes hand motions) does it's own thing. I'll tell you. That's a million dollor idea right there. Just sell the tops."
S08E21,KRAMER,I have a right to be here. These are my fans. Hey you're hurting my elbow.
S08E21,MAN 1,Try looking up hayseed.
S08E21,MAN 2,You wanna sightsee? Get on a bus.
S08E21,MARY ANNE,Please don't think all New Yorkers are so rude.
S08E21,GEORGE,Well actually I'm...
S08E21,MARY ANNE,I'm Mary Anne. I work for the New York Visitor's Center. Where are you visiting from?
S08E21,GEORGE,"Little Rock, Arkensas."
S08E21,MARY ANNE,Ooh.
S08E21,JERRY,Hmm. That looks new.
S08E21,KRAMER,So get this. Peterman has his henchmen forcefully eject me from the book signing like I'm some kind of a maniac.
S08E21,JERRY,(uncomfortably) Yeah that's too bad.
S08E21,KRAMER,What's the matter with you?
S08E21,JERRY,(uncomfortably) Nothing.
S08E21,KRAMER,"No, no, no. Don't give me that. I know you. Something's wrong. What is it."
S08E21,JERRY,I did something stupid.
S08E21,KRAMER,What did you do?
S08E21,JERRY,"Well I was shaving. And I noticed an asymmetry in my chest hair and I was trying to even it out. Next thing I knew, (high pitched voice) Gone."
S08E21,KRAMER,Don't you know you're not supposed to poke around down there.
S08E21,JERRY,Well women do it.
S08E21,KRAMER,"(high pitched voice) ""Well women do it."" I'll tell you what. I'll pick you up a sundress and a parasol and you can just (high pitched voice) sashey your pretty little self around the town square."
S08E21,JERRY,Well what am I going to tell Alex?
S08E21,KRAMER,Listen to me. You don't tell anybody about this. No one. You hear me?
S08E21,JERRY,Um hum.
S08E21,KRAMER,"Hey, Jerry shaved his chest."
S08E21,JERRY,Hey!
S08E21,KRAMER,I forgot. Wait. Never mind.
S08E21,ALEX,How about the beach this weekend?
S08E21,JERRY,You couldn't pay me enough to go to the beach on a weekend. I mean it's hard enough...
S08E21,ALEX,"All right. All right. Wow is that a Mexican Hairless? Oh, I love those. Ooh, Hairless. This is where it's at. It's so much smoother and cleaner."
S08E21,JERRY,Really?
S08E21,ELAINE,"""Top of the Muffin to you!""?"
S08E21,MR. LIPPMAN,Top of the muffin to you. Elaine!
S08E21,ELAINE,Mr Lippman?
S08E21,JERRY,So you're pretending to be a tourist?
S08E21,GEORGE,"It's beautiful. She makes all the plans. I'm not from around here so it's okay if I'm stupid, and she knows I'm only in town visiting so there's no messy breakup"
S08E21,JERRY,How do you explain your apartment?
S08E21,GEORGE,I got a hotel room.
S08E21,JERRY,you moved into a hotel?
S08E21,GEORGE,Well I don't know anyone here Jerry. Where else am I going to stay?
S08E21,JERRY,So get this we're in the park today Alex goes wild for this hairless dog.
S08E21,GEORGE,So?
S08E21,JERRY,So. I figure since she likes one hairless animal why not another.
S08E21,GEORGE,Oh really. You tell her you shaved it?
S08E21,JERRY,Are you nuts? I don't want her to think I'm one of those low-rise briefs guys who shaves his chest.
S08E21,KRAMER,(yelling up at Jerry) Hey Jerry.
S08E21,KRAMER,(yelling) I'm starting a Peterman Reality Bus Tour. Check it out. Hahaha.
S08E21,GEORGE,Reality tour?
S08E21,JERRY,The last thing this guy's qualified to give a tour of is reality.
S08E21,ELAINE,This was my idea you stole my idea.
S08E21,MR. LIPPMAN,Elaine these ideas are all in the air. They're in the air.
S08E21,ELAINE,Well if that air is comming out of this face then it is my air and my idea.
S08E21,MR. LIPPMAN,You want a muffin or not?
S08E21,ELAINE,Peach.
S08E21,MARY ANNE,So I notice you don't have much of an accent.
S08E21,GEORGE,Yeah my parents have it. Sometimes it skips a generation.
S08E21,MARY ANNE,"Look george, I'm really enjoying spending time with you but I'm not sure this is going to work out. At some point you're going back to your job at Tyler Chicken and your three-legged dog Willie."
S08E21,GEORGE,Willie. Yeah.
S08E21,MARY ANNE,And I'm still going to be here.
S08E21,GEORGE,Well what if I told you I'm thinking of moving here?
S08E21,MARY ANNE,"(laughs) George, no offense. But this city would eat you alive."
S08E21,JERRY,You're moving to New York? That's fantastic. I can see you all the time now.
S08E21,GEORGE,"Eat me alive, huh? We'll see who can make it in *this* town."
S08E21,JERRY,What is it she think you can't do?
S08E21,GEORGE,Find a job. Get an apartment.
S08E21,JERRY,How did you do those things?
S08E21,GEORGE,"Never mind. The're done. All I have to do now is redo them. You know if you take everything I've ever done in my entire life and condense it down into one day, it looks decent."
S08E21,JERRY,"Hey, what were you doing with that bus yesterday?"
S08E21,KRAMER,"Here you go, here you go, check it out."
S08E21,JERRY,"""The Real Peterman Reality Bus Tour"". I'm confused."
S08E21,KRAMER,Peterman's book is big business. People want to know the stories behind the stories.
S08E21,JERRY,Nobody wants to go on a three hour bus tour of a totally unknown person's life.
S08E21,KRAMER,"I'm only charging $37.50, plus you get a pizza bagel and desert."
S08E21,GEORGE,What's desert?
S08E21,KRAMER,Bite-size Three Musketeers. Just like the real Peterman eats.
S08E21,GEORGE,He eats those?
S08E21,KRAMER,No. I eat those. I'm the real Peterman.
S08E21,GEORGE,"I think I understand this. Jay Peterman is real. His biography is not. Now, you Kramer are real."
S08E21,KRAMER,Talk to me.
S08E21,GEORGE,"But your life is Peterman's. Now the bus tour, which is real, takes to places that, while they are real, they are not real in sense that they did not *really* happen to the *real* Peterman which is you."
S08E21,KRAMER,Understand?
S08E21,JERRY,Yeah. $37.50 for a Three Musketeers.
S08E21,MR. LIPPMAN,Elaine. I'm in over my head. Nobody likes my muffin tops.
S08E21,ELAINE,So? What do you want me to do about it?
S08E21,MR. LIPPMAN,"You're the muffin top expert, tell me what I'm doing wrong."
S08E21,ELAINE,"Mr. Lippman, when I worked for you at Pendent Publishing, I believed in you, you know as a man of integrity. But, I saw you in that paper hat and that aprin..."
S08E21,MR. LIPPMAN,What if I cut you in for 30% of the profits?
S08E21,ELAINE,"Deal. Here's your problem. You're making just the muffin tops. You've gotta make the *whole* muffin. Then you... Pop the top, toss the stump. Taste."
S08E21,MR. LIPPMAN,Ah. (takes a bite of the top.) Mmmmm. Ah hah?
S08E21,ELAINE,Yeah.
S08E21,MR. LIPPMAN,So what do we with the bottoms?
S08E21,ELAINE,"I don't know, give em to a soup kitchen."
S08E21,MR. LIPPMAN,That's a good idea.
S08E21,ELAINE,"And one more thing, you really think we need the exclamation point? Because, it's not ""Top of the Muffin *TO YOU!!!*"""
S08E21,MR. LIPPMAN,No. No. It is.
S08E21,KRAMER,Hey Jerry. What is this? Lady Gillette? What's going on?
S08E21,JERRY,What? Can't I get a moment's peace?
S08E21,KRAMER,What are you doing to yourself?
S08E21,JERRY,I can't stop. Alex thinks I'm naturally hairless.
S08E21,KRAMER,"You can't keep this up. Don't you know what's going to happen? Everytime you shave it, it's going to come in thicker and fuller and darker."
S08E21,JERRY,Oh that's an old wives tale.
S08E21,KRAMER,Is it? Look at this.
S08E21,KRAMER,(high pitched voice) Look at it! Look at it! And it's all me. I shaved there when I was a lifeguard.
S08E21,JERRY,Oh come on. That's genetics. That's not going to happen to me.
S08E21,KRAMER,Won't it? Or is it already starting to happen?
S08E21,ELAINE,Wow. Look at this. We're cleaning up.
S08E21,LIPPMAN,"Oh, Rubin, get me another tray of lowfat cranberry."
S08E21,REBECCA,"Excuse me, I'm Rebecca Demore from the homeless shelter."
S08E21,ELAINE,"Oh, hi."
S08E21,REBECCA,Are you the ones leaveing the muffing pieces behind our shelter?
S08E21,ELAINE,You been enjoying them?
S08E21,REBECCA,They're just stumps.
S08E21,ELAINE,Well they're perfectly edible.
S08E21,REBECCA,"Oh, so you just assume that the homeless will eat them, they'll eat anything?"
S08E21,MR. LIPPMAN,"No no, we just thought..."
S08E21,REBECCA,"I know what you thought. They don't have homes, they don't have jobs, what do they need the top of a muffin for? They're lucky to get the stumps."
S08E21,ELAINE,If the homeless don't like them the homeless don't have to eat them.
S08E21,REBECCA,The homeless don't like them.
S08E21,ELAINE,Fine.
S08E21,REBECCA,"We've never gotten so many complaints. Every two minutes, ""Where is the top of this muffin? Who ate the rest of this?"""
S08E21,ELAINE,We were just trying to help.
S08E21,REBECCA,Why don't you just drop off some chicken skins and lobster shells.
S08E21,ELAINE,I think I might.
S08E21,MARY ANNE,I can't believe you found something so quickly. How much you pay?
S08E21,GEORGE,$2300.
S08E21,MARY ANNE,Ouch. A month?
S08E21,GEORGE,Yeah.
S08E21,MARY ANNE,"Well, guess that's all right for now, but if you say here for more than a few months, you're a real sucker."
S08E21,GEORGE,"Yeah, well I uh got lots of other stuff to show you too. Wait till you see the plum job that I landed."
S08E21,MARY ANNE,Yeah. We should let this place air out anyway. It smells like the last tenant had monkeys or something.
S08E21,KRAMER,"Comming up on the right, if you glance up you can just make out my bedroom window. It's the one that's covered in chicken wire."
S08E21,WOMAN,"Hey if you're the real Peterman, who come you're wearing those ratty clothes? The're not very romantic."
S08E21,KRAMER,(over the speaker) Well that's your opinion.
S08E21,MAN 1,Can I have another Three Musketeers? They're rather small.
S08E21,KRAMER,Forget it. Okay Newman's postal route is around here somewhere.
S08E21,MAN 2,Who's Newman?
S08E21,MAN 3,Who cares.
S08E21,MAN 4,"Hey fake Peterman, let me off. I'm nautious."
S08E21,MAN 1,Can I have his candy bar?
S08E21,KRAMER,"Ahh. Everyone just settle down. We have three hours left on this thing, and I can't drive and argue with you rubes all at the same time. Okay. Lomez's place of worship is right on the right here."
S08E21,JERRY,Why do I have to go on the tour?
S08E21,KRAMER,"Jerry you're a minor celebrity. If you go on this thing, it could create a minor stir. Bring that girlfriend of your and I'll only charge to 60 bucks."
S08E21,JERRY,"Hey, how's business?"
S08E21,ELAINE,"Ooh, I've got stump troubles. The Sanitation Department won't get rid of them all, I can't get a truck to haul this stuff until next week. Meanwhile, I'm sitting on a mountain of stumps."
S08E21,KRAMER,"All right, I've got to hose the puke off the floor of the bus."
S08E21,ELAINE,"Bus? Wait a minute, wait a minute, bus? You've got a bus?"
S08E21,KRAMER,Yeah.
S08E21,ELAINE,You got any room on that thing?
S08E21,KRAMER,Yeah there are a few seats still available.
S08E21,ELAINE,Do you think you could transport some stumps for me? I'll make it worth your while.
S08E21,KRAMER,"Well, if they don't mind sitting in the back."
S08E21,ELAINE,No they don't.
S08E21,KRAMER,Are they war veterans?
S08E21,MARY ANNE,Wow this is your office.
S08E21,MR. STEINBRENNER,"Woah. Hello. Sorry George, didn't know you got a girl in here. Give me a signal on the doornob like a necktie or a sock or something. Come on George, help me out."
S08E21,MARY ANNE,"Mr. Steinbrenner, I would like to thank you for taking a chance on a hen supervisor at Tyler Chicken like our boy George here."
S08E21,MR. STEINBRENNER,Hen supervisor from Tyler Chicken?
S08E21,GEORGE,Yes. Very nice to have had her to mention... (starting to leave)
S08E21,MR. STEINBRENNER,Wait a minute George.
S08E21,GEORGE,Be right with you. Look Mr. Steinbrenner.
S08E21,MR. STEINBRENNER,"Moonlighting for Tyler Chicken. Pretty impressive George. Days with the New York Yankees and nights in Arkensas with a top flight bird outlet. And a hen supervisor to boot. I am blown. Bloooown away. Blown George. (vibration in the ""o""'s) Bloooooooooooooooooooown."
S08E21,ALEX,"You know when you make a pizza bagel, you really shouldn't use cinnimon rasin."
S08E21,JERRY,You also shouldn't use a donut.
S08E21,KRAMER,All right ladies and gentlemen. Welcome to the Peterman Reality Tour...
S08E21,TAPE PLAYER,Turn music off.
S08E21,JERRY,Can we just go?
S08E21,KRAMER,And go we will.
S08E21,MAN,What is this? A piece of pound cake?
S08E21,KRAMER,We have a bonus reality stop today. We will be hauling muffin stumps to the local repository.
S08E21,MAN 2,We're going to a garbage dump?
S08E21,KRAMER,And we're off.
S08E21,JERRY,"You know I never though he would be able to recreate the experience of actually knowing him, but this is pretty close."
S08E21,MR. STEINBRENNER,(the back of his head to the camera) John Tyler? George Steinbreener here. I want to talk about George Castanza. I understand he's been dividing his time between us and you. I cannot have that.
S08E21,JOHN TYLER,(the back of his head also to the camera) Well I don't know who he is but if you want him that bad I'm not giving him up that easily.
S08E21,MR. STEINBRENNER,Oh is that so. Playing a little hardball huh Jonnyboy?
S08E21,JOHN TYLER,"How about this. You give me Castanza, I convert your concessions to all chicken no charge. Instead of hot dogs, chicken dogs. Instead of pretzels, chicken twists. Instead of beer, alcoholic chicken."
S08E21,MR. STEINBRENNER,How do you make that alcoholic chicken?
S08E21,JOHN TYLER,"Let if ferment, just like everything else."
S08E21,MR. STEINBRENNER,That stuff sounds great. All right. I'll have Costanza on the next bus.
S08E21,MAN,Hey hey hey hey hey. Where do you think you're going?
S08E21,KRAMER,I was going to dump this.
S08E21,MAN,It doesn't look like garbage.
S08E21,KRAMER,Well it's muffin stumps
S08E21,MAN,Where are the muffin tops?
S08E21,KRAMER,This is a garbage dump. Just let me dump it.
S08E21,MAN,Can't do it.
S08E21,KRAMER,Is this a joke?
S08E21,MAN,That's what I'd like to know about it.
S08E21,ALEX,"You have a pretty heavy beard, don't you?"
S08E21,JERRY,What's that?
S08E21,ALEX,Well look it's almost time for you to shave again.
S08E21,JERRY,Oh. Yeah.
S08E21,KRAMER,"(gets back on the bus, yelling) Well maybe I will take it up with Consumer Affairs. Ladies and Gentlemen you're in for an additional treat. We're going to extend the tour at no extra charge."
S08E21,MAN,Where are we going?
S08E21,KRAMER,"(looking at a map) I don't know. (over the speaker) Uh, no more questions."
S08E21,WAITRESS,"So, the New York Yankees traded you for a bunch of Tyler chicken."
S08E21,GEORGE,"Dogs, twists, a kind of fermented chicken drink."
S08E21,MAN,"Hey, aren't you the guy I asked to watch my clothes?"
S08E21,GEORGE,What clothes?
S08E21,MAN,These clothes. The ones you're wearing.
S08E21,JERRY,(in low voice to next to Kramer) Kramer how much longer? My chest hair is comming back and it's itching me like crazy. I can't let her see me scratch it.
S08E21,KRAMER,Don't worry. I've got a good feeling about this dump.
S08E21,JERRY,"I'm telling you man, I'm losing it."
S08E21,JERRY,I can't sit on this bus anymore. I think I'll go play with that dog.
S08E21,KRAMER,I don't know where the tops are.
S08E21,KRAMER,Jerry what's the matter?
S08E21,JERRY,"(for the first half of the howl, a dog howls along with him.) Awoooooo-oooooooo, that feels good."
S08E21,BARTENDER,"Hey, you looking for George?"
S08E21,MARY ANNE,Yeah.
S08E21,BARTENDER,He's been in the bathroom awhile. You might want to check on him.
S08E21,GEORGE,(talking on the phone) Jerry you gotta bring me some clothes down here. I lost my job with the Yankees. I'm standing in the men's room on 43rd street in my underpants.
S08E21,MARY ANNE,I told you this city would eat you alive.
S08E21,MR. LIPPMAN,What is this guy again?
S08E21,ELAINE,They call him a Cleaner. He makes problems go away.
S08E21,NEWMAN,Hello Elaine. Where are they?
S08E21,ELAINE,In the back.
S08E21,NEWMAN,"All right, I'm going to need a clean 8 ounce glass."
S08E21,MR. LIPPMAN,What is going on here?
S08E21,NEWMAN,"If I'm curt, then I appologize. But as I understand it, we have a situation here and time is of the essence."
S08E21,"(Newman goes to the back room with the muffin stumps and sets down a cooler and an empty glass. From the cooler he takes out 4 bottles of milk and sets them down. He bites into a stump, then takes a drink of milk from the glass. (continuity error",he never actually poured the glass of milk.) He swishes the muffin and the milk together and swollows. He takes another stump.)
S08E22,JERRY,"Nah, you had a good run. Took them to the World Series."
S08E22,GEORGE,I got to give the players most of the credit for that.
S08E22,JERRY,"Don't sell yourself short. You made all the flight arrangements, hotels, busses."
S08E22,GEORGE,"No, I don't know who was doing that."
S08E22,JERRY,"So, when you actually did work, what it was that you did?"
S08E22,GEORGE,They had a pastry cart you wouldn't believe.
S08E22,LANETTE,"Here you go. Your latt, your cappuccino."
S08E22,JERRY,Maybe I should ask her out?
S08E22,GEORGE,She is a good waitress.
S08E22,JERRY,That's true. Maybe I take her to the Tony's.
S08E22,GEORGE,You're going to the Tony's?
S08E22,JERRY,"Yeah, I wrote some jokes to the show and they gave me two tickets."
S08E22,GEORGE,Why didn't you ask me? I know a million theater jokes. 'What's the deal with those guys down in the pit?'
S08E22,JERRY,They're musicians. That's not a joke.
S08E22,GEORGE,It's a funny observation.
S08E22,GEORGE,Severance package...The Yankees are giving me three months full pay for doing nothing.
S08E22,JERRY,They did it for three years. What's another few months.
S08E22,GEORGE,I'm really going to do something with these three months.
S08E22,JERRY,Like what?
S08E22,GEORGE,I'm gonna read a book. From beginning to end. In that order.
S08E22,JERRY,I've always wanted to do that...
S08E22,GEORGE,I'm gonna play frolf.
S08E22,JERRY,You mean golf?
S08E22,GEORGE,"Frolf, frisbee golf Jerry. Golf with a frisbee. This is gonna be my time. Time to taste the fruits and let the juices drip down my chin. I proclaim this The Summer of George!"
S08E22,ELAINE,...and then Peterman ate it. I never told him.
S08E22,ELAINE,Who's that?
S08E22,DUGAN,"That's Sam, the new girl in the counting."
S08E22,WALTER,What's with her arms? They just hang like salamis.
S08E22,DUGAN,She walks like orangutan.
S08E22,ELAINE,Better call the zoo.
S08E22,DUGAN,Reer...
S08E22,ELAINE,What?
S08E22,WALTER,ssssss...
S08E22,DUGAN,Cat-ty...
S08E22,ELAINE,It's like she's carrying invisible suitcases.
S08E22,JERRY,Like this? (imitates the walk)
S08E22,ELAINE,"Yes, exactly."
S08E22,JERRY,That's so strange.
S08E22,ELAINE,Right. So why I'm the one who gets 'reer'. You know I mean they were being as catty as I was. It's a double standard.
S08E22,JERRY,"Oh, what about 'ladies night'? Women admitted free before 10?"
S08E22,ELAINE,That is so stupid.
S08E22,JERRY,Reer.
S08E22,GEORGE,"Hey, 'The White Shadow' is on..."
S08E22,JERRY,"Boy, your really packing it all in."
S08E22,GEORGE,"Jerry, my vacation just started. I need a day or two to de-compress. Besides, I did plenty today."
S08E22,JERRY,Like what?
S08E22,GEORGE,I bought a new recliner with a fridge build right in to it.
S08E22,KRAMER,"Hey Jerry, you got any Tums?"
S08E22,JERRY,Stomach ache?
S08E22,KRAMER,I drank too much water in the shower.
S08E22,JERRY,"Aah, top of the fridge. Hey George, I'm taking that waitress to the Tony's."
S08E22,GEORGE,Shadow!
S08E22,KRAMER,"Oh, the Tony's. I'll see you there buddy."
S08E22,ELAINE,You're going to the Tony's too?
S08E22,KRAMER,Roger that.
S08E22,JERRY,Where are you sitting?
S08E22,KRAMER,"Well, all over the place. Yeah, I'm a seat filler. They don't like to see empty seats on TV so when somebody gets up I just park my kaboos on their spot until they get back."
S08E22,ELAINE,How did you get that job?
S08E22,KRAMER,"Mickey, Mickey he hooked me up. He's a member of the academy."
S08E22,JERRY,What academy?
S08E22,KRAMER,"Well, he didn't say (leaves)."
S08E22,LANETTE,Hi!
S08E22,JERRY,Hi!
S08E22,LANETTE,Nice tuxedo.
S08E22,JERRY,"Thanks, it's a breakaway."
S08E22,LANETTE,Should we go?
S08E22,JERRY,Absolutely.
S08E22,LANETTE,"Lyle, were going! Jerry, this is Lyle."
S08E22,LYLE,"Hey, how you doing?"
S08E22,JERRY,Ok...
S08E22,LANETTE,Bye.
S08E22,LYLE,Have a good time.
S08E22,JERRY,"Thanks, Lyle..."
S08E22,KRAMER,Are you leaving? Cause I got you covered.
S08E22,KRAMER,I'll just squeeze in...
S08E22,MAN,What are you doing?
S08E22,KRAMER,My job. What are you doing?
S08E22,KRAMER,"You know, if they catch two of us on TV, you got some explaining to do."
S08E22,JERRY,"So, you and Lyle are roommates?"
S08E22,LANETTE,No.
S08E22,JERRY,Gay?
S08E22,LANETTE,What?
S08E22,JERRY,Is he gay?
S08E22,LANETTE,No.
S08E22,JERRY,Are you sure?
S08E22,LANETTE,I think I would know.
S08E22,JERRY,(to himself) This is a new one.
S08E22,KRAMER,(to woman next to him) Pemmican turkey? Come on take a bite...well more for me.
S08E22,ANNOUNCER,...and the best musical award goes to Scarsdale surprise!
S08E22,GEORGE,Kramer?
S08E22,MR. GRAHAM,(on TV) Thank you and God bless you all. This has truly been a Scarsdale surprise!
S08E22,SAM,"Elaine, am I crazy? I just get the feeling that Dugan and the others are making fun of me all the time."
S08E22,ELAINE,"Well, You might wanna think about...maybe, eh...moving your arms a little when you walk."
S08E22,SAM,My arms?
S08E22,ELAINE,"You know, sort of swing them, so your not lurching around like a caveman."
S08E22,SAM,I a caveman?
S08E22,ELAINE,"No no no no, it's just..."
S08E22,SAM,Everybody told what a catty shrude you are. Your horrible!
S08E22,GEORGE,She had a dude?
S08E22,JERRY,"Yeah, when I went to pick her up there was this dude."
S08E22,GEORGE,How do you know it was her dude?
S08E22,JERRY,What do you think it could've been just some dude?
S08E22,GEORGE,"Sure, dudes in this town are dime a dozen."
S08E22,JERRY,I reckon.
S08E22,GEORGE,"Or maybe, she just wanted to go to the Tony's. I tell you what; you ask her out again. No Tony, just Jerry. That way you know it he was her dude or just some dude."
S08E22,JERRY,Dude!
S08E22,GEORGE,"All right, that's enough. I gotta go home and take a nap."
S08E22,JERRY,It's 1030 in the morning?
S08E22,GEORGE,I tell you; I'm wiped.
S08E22,JERRY,"So, has the summer of George already started or are you still de-composing?"
S08E22,GEORGE,De-compressing.
S08E22,KRAMER,"Whooa, good morning gentleman and Tony says hello to you."
S08E22,JERRY,You didn't give that thing back?
S08E22,KRAMER,"Jerry, it was a whirlwind. They whisked us backstage, the media is sworming, champagne is flowing...whooo! I can't describe how great it is to win."
S08E22,JERRY,That's because you didn't win.
S08E22,GEORGE,'Scarsdale surprise'. That's the musical about that Scarsdale diet doctor murder.
S08E22,KRAMER,Featuring the mind-blowing performance of Ms. Raquel Welch!
S08E22,JERRY,You haven't even seen it.
S08E22,KRAMER,"Aah, Jerry I'm not gonna let you bring me down from this high. I've been partying all night. I saw the sunrise at Liza's!"
S08E22,GEORGE,"What, Minelli's!?!"
S08E22,KRAMER,No.
S08E22,ELAINE,"Sam, listen I'm so sorry about the other day."
S08E22,SAM,"No, don't apologize Elaine. I was thinking that maybe I should swing my arms a little bit more."
S08E22,ELAINE,"See, yeah, that's all I was saying."
S08E22,SAM,"How's this (Sam hits a pen case out of the table), or this (swings a paper holder of the table and starts to clear the table left and right)."
S08E22,ELAINE,"Well, you seem to be getting a hang of it..."
S08E22,JERRY,Hi!
S08E22,LANETTE,"Sorry, I'm running late. I just lost track of time."
S08E22,JERRY,No rush.
S08E22,LYLE,"Hey, Jerry! What's up?"
S08E22,JERRY,(to himself) I have absolutely no idea.
S08E22,JERRY,..except that the dude plays the showroom and I'm stuck doing food and beveridged!
S08E22,GEORGE,Who's that?
S08E22,JERRY,It's Kramer.
S08E22,GEORGE,Hey Kramer.
S08E22,JERRY,George says hi.
S08E22,KRAMER,(shouts to the telephone) Hi George!
S08E22,GEORGE,How's that Tony?
S08E22,JERRY,Why don't you just come over?
S08E22,GEORGE,Why can't we do this on the phone? What's Kramer doing now?
S08E22,JERRY,He's looking on to fridgerator.
S08E22,GEORGE,Kramer. Anything good in there? Any Popsicles?
S08E22,JERRY,I can't do this.
S08E22,KRAMER,"So, what's George doing?"
S08E22,JERRY,He's not doing anything. Goodbye!
S08E22,KRAMER,"So listen, I'm going to crab a bite to eat at Sardi's. You wanna go?"
S08E22,JERRY,Are you taking the Tony to Sardi's?
S08E22,KRAMER,The Tony is taking me to Sardi's.
S08E22,JERRY,"Oh, hello."
S08E22,KRAMER,I'm going.
S08E22,LANETTE,Congratulations!
S08E22,KRAMER,"Oh, thank you, thank you so much. I have so many people I want to thank and don't want to forget anyone..."
S08E22,JERRY,"All right, all right."
S08E22,JERRY,I said no! (hangs up the phone.)
S08E22,LANETTE,"Jerry, I just want to let you know; Lyle and I are completely over. I'd rather be with you."
S08E22,JERRY,Just me? No dudes or fellas?
S08E22,LANETTE,What you think?
S08E22,JERRY,I can start right away.
S08E22,JERRY,But not here. (They leave.)
S08E22,JERRY'S ANSWERING MACHINE,"'I'm not here, leave a message.'"
S08E22,GEORGE,"(on the answering machine) Jerry, what's happening? Come on, pick up the phone."
S08E22,KRAMER,"...so I said to him Arthur, Artie come on, why does the salesman have to die? Change the title; The life of a salesman. That's what people want to see."
S08E22,MR. GRAHAM,"Mr. Kramer, my name is Lewis Maxton Graham. I'm one of the producers of 'Scarsdale surprise'."
S08E22,KRAMER,"Hey, eh, Lew!"
S08E22,MR. GRAHAM,We need to talk.
S08E22,PETERMAN,"Elaine, what did you want to talk me about?"
S08E22,ELAINE,This. My office. Sam trashed my office.
S08E22,PETERMAN,"Well, I see what's going on in here. I am smack dab in the middle of a good old fashioned cat fight."
S08E22,ELAINE,"Mr. Petermen, this is not a cat fight. This is violent psychotic behavior directed at me all because are told her to swing her arms."
S08E22,PETERMAN,Woof!
S08E22,ELAINE,"Do you mean ""reer?"""
S08E22,PETERMAN,"Yes, that's the one! Good day Elaine. (Leaves.)"
S08E22,ELAINE,"Oh, no please Mr. Peterman, she's crazy! (Sam walks by and Elaine starts to sing) Crazy for feelings..."
S08E22,JERRY,I can't believe how much we did this afternoon. I have friends who this would've be their whole life.
S08E22,LANETTE,"Now, what time are you picking me up tonight?"
S08E22,JERRY,"Eh, what?"
S08E22,LANETTE,"You got our reservation from Sfuzi's, didn't you?"
S08E22,JERRY,"Oh yeah, Sfuzi? I- I've gotta do that."
S08E22,LANETTE,Should I ware the outfit I bought today?
S08E22,JERRY,Sure.
S08E22,LANETTE,Which one?
S08E22,JERRY,The one with the...(mumbles.)
S08E22,LANETTE,"If I wanna get my hair cut I've gotta go now. Call me when you get home. I wont be there, but leave a message so I know you called."
S08E22,JERRY,"Ok, ok..."
S08E22,LANETTE,Do you mind?
S08E22,JERRY,"No, I'll crab it."
S08E22,GEORGE,"Hey, I've done that today."
S08E22,JERRY,"What, did you lose your remote?"
S08E22,GEORGE,"Nah, the cable's out. What's with you? You look dead."
S08E22,JERRY,It's Lanette! I need an assistant or intern or something.
S08E22,GEORGE,"(Laughs) Relationship intern...hey, what if two of us teamed up?"
S08E22,JERRY,Not.
S08E22,GEORGE,"No, no..."
S08E22,JERRY,"No, because that's..."
S08E22,GEORGE,"No, listen; we are always sitting here, I am always helping you with your girl problems and you are helping me with my girl problems. Where do we end up?"
S08E22,JERRY,Here.
S08E22,GEORGE,Exactly! Because neither one of us can't handle a woman all by ourselves.
S08E22,JERRY,I'm trying.
S08E22,GEORGE,"I've tried. We don't have it. But maybe the two of us, working together at full capacity, could do the job of one normal man."
S08E22,JERRY,Then each of us would only have be like a half man. That sounds about right!
S08E22,MR. GRAHAM,I'm sure how excited you are to have this very very prestigious award. But you didn't have anything to do with the actual production.
S08E22,KRAMER,No.
S08E22,MR. GRAHAM,I don't think there's no way how we can allow you to keep this Tony. Unless...
S08E22,KRAMER,Anything...
S08E22,MALCOLM,"Are you familiar with our star, Raquel Welch?"
S08E22,KRAMER,"Oh yeah, she's fantastic...."
S08E22,MR. GRAHAM,She's a train wreck.
S08E22,MALCOLM,There's a big tap dance number just before Jean Harris leaves the (?) school to confront Dr Tarnover.
S08E22,MR. GRAHAM,It is a gut wrenching scene.
S08E22,MALCOLM,"But, Raquel Welch doesn't move her arms when she tap dances. It's very distracting."
S08E22,MR. GRAHAM,There's lot of this (swings his arms) in tap dancing.
S08E22,KRAMER,"So, you'd like me to teach how to dance?"
S08E22,MALCOLM,"No, we want you to fire her."
S08E22,JERRY,Why they want you to fire Raquel Welch?
S08E22,KRAMER,"Because they're terrified of her. I heard from someone that when they cut one of her lines, she climbed up the rope on side of the stage and started dropping lights on peoples heads. Story like that has got to be true."
S08E22,JERRY,She seems very nice.
S08E22,KRAMER,"Jerry, you're not in show business. You don't know what these people are like."
S08E22,JERRY,I'm in show business.
S08E22,KRAMER,"Oh, come on! What am I gonna do? She's going to eat me alive."
S08E22,JERRY,I've got a tape of 'Fantastic voyage' if you think that would help.
S08E22,KRAMER,Yayaya...
S08E22,ELAINE,"Jerry, that crazy straight-armed woman down at Peterman's trashed my office. And then listen to this; this is message she left me."
S08E22,SAM'S VOICE,Elaine...I am going to find you. If not in your office then in the xerox room or the little conference room near to the kitchen...
S08E22,ELAINE,She must've got a blueprint of the building or something.
S08E22,JERRY,Did you tell Peterman about this?
S08E22,ELAINE,"Well, I tried, but he thought it was some sort of cat fight."
S08E22,KRAMER,Cat fight?
S08E22,ELAINE,"Ok, why? Why do guys do this? What is so appealing to men about a cat fight?"
S08E22,KRAMER,Yeye cat fight!
S08E22,JERRY,Because men think if women are grabbing and clawing at each other there's a chance they might somehow kiss.
S08E22,KRAMER,T-t-t-t...
S08E22,JERRY,You got the tickets?
S08E22,GEORGE,"Yeah, two for the 715 of Novaj pravas (?). What you're wearing the green sweater?"
S08E22,JERRY,I like it.
S08E22,GEORGE,"She doesn't like. Here is your blue one, it's her favorite. (Takes sweater out of his bag.)"
S08E22,JERRY,What?
S08E22,GEORGE,"Just put it on! All right now, remember she had her nails done today so remark how you like the color. And if you need me you beep me, all right. Here you go, hey, hey, hey, hey...(sprays Binaca into Jerry's mouth.) Go get'em you're a tiger!"
S08E22,JERRY,"Hey George, one second, she's having a party friday night and she wants me to take care of the invitations."
S08E22,GEORGE,A little notice would've helped! How many people?
S08E22,JERRY,"35, and George, on the invitations..."
S08E22,GEORGE,"I know, I know...don't skimp. Go go go go..."
S08E22,LANETTE,"Right on time, I like that."
S08E22,JERRY,"I like your nails, that is a great color."
S08E22,LANETTE,Love the sweater.
S08E22,JERRY,This old thing?
S08E22,GEORGE,"Hi, I need some party invitations."
S08E22,CLERK,"Okay, have you been in here before?"
S08E22,GEORGE,About a year ago. Wedding invitations.
S08E22,CLERK,"Right, how did that all work out?"
S08E22,GEORGE,No complaints.
S08E22,CLERK,"Well, they are arranged according the price. And as I recall...(she flips the sample book all the way to the end.)"
S08E22,GEORGE,"Actually, (George flips the book back to the beginning) I'll take these nice glossy ones."
S08E22,RAQUEL,"""You are a fraud Dr Tarnover. You haven't even been to Scarsdale."""
S08E22,KRAMER,Ms. Welch.
S08E22,RAQUEL,Who are you?
S08E22,KRAMER,"Well, I'm Cosmo Kramer, I'm one of the producers."
S08E22,RAQUEL,"Hello, Sidney! No, no I told you I don't want to do that! If you bring it up again I will feed your genitals to a wolf! (hangs up) Kids! You're still here."
S08E22,KRAMER,"Well, I- I Ms. Welch I do need to talk to you about a little problem regarding, eh, your performance."
S08E22,RAQUEL,What kind of problem?
S08E22,KRAMER,"Well, it seems that due to the vagaries of the production parameters of this fragmenting of the audience to the cable television, carnivals, water parks..."
S08E22,RAQUEL,Out with it!
S08E22,KRAMER,"Well, you're fired because you don't move your arms when you tap dance, you're like a gorilla out there I've gotta go..."
S08E22,GUY,Little help?
S08E22,GEORGE,"Hey, frolf?"
S08E22,GUY,"Yeah, you know we need a fourth for the back nine. You want in?"
S08E22,(George looks up and sees Jerry on the other side and frisbee on the other. Jerry says,"""What's the deal with airplane peanuts?"")"
S08E22,GEORGE,"Yeah, sure."
S08E22,GUY,"Ok, come on."
S08E22,JERRY,"Ok, let's towel it up."
S08E22,LANETTE,"Jerry, where are those invitations you were supposed to get? If they don't go out today they're useless."
S08E22,JERRY,But we're in towels.
S08E22,LANETTE,Jerry.
S08E22,JERRY,all right. One second.
S08E22,GEORGE,"He frolfs, he scores...(he drops one invitation on the stairs.)"
S08E22,GEORGE,Hello.
S08E22,JERRY,"George, where are those invitations? You were supposed to leave them with her doorman!"
S08E22,LANETTE,Did you shave your chest hair?
S08E22,JERRY,No. (Lanette leaves.) Did you at least pick them up?
S08E22,GEORGE,"Yeah, the super glossy. The best they had."
S08E22,JERRY,"Ok, get them over here pronto. We're in towels here George."
S08E22,GEORGE,"All right, All right, keep your towel on."
S08E22,JERRY,...what?
S08E22,GEORGE,It's a joke.
S08E22,JERRY,"All right, that's not bad. Now get over here!"
S08E22,SAM'S VOICE,(on the tape)...if not in your apartment then in the laundry room or the ATM in the building across the street or the watch shop!
S08E22,ELAINE,Can't you do anything about this? I mean this woman is a psycho!
S08E22,COP #1,'Reer.'
S08E22,ELAINE,"Look, just because I'm a woman..."
S08E22,COP #2,'Mauau.'
S08E22,COP #1,'Meeow.'
S08E22,RAQUEL,I don't move my arms when I dance. That's my signature!
S08E22,ELAINE,"Would you just keep an eye out for this woman. She's about ye high and eh, she doesn't swing her arms when she walks."
S08E22,COP #1,What do you mean?
S08E22,ELAINE,Like this...(imitates the walk with her arms hanging.)
S08E22,RAQUEL,What the hell is that? Are you making fun of my dancing?
S08E22,ELAINE,Aren't you Raquel Welch?
S08E22,RAQUEL,"You know who I am. Now, what are you doing?"
S08E22,ELAINE,"Nothing, I wasn't just moving my arms..."
S08E22,RAQUEL,"That's it, you are going down."
S08E22,COP #1,"Ooh, cat fight."
S08E22,KRAMER,So how's George?
S08E22,JERRY,I don't know. They don't tell me anything. What's that? (Kramer holds a broken Tony)
S08E22,KRAMER,Tony.
S08E22,JERRY,What happened to you?
S08E22,KRAMER,Raquel Welch!
S08E22,JERRY,Yikes.
S08E22,JERRY,What happened to you?
S08E22,ELAINE,Raquel Welch!
S08E22,KRAMER,The woman is a menace.
S08E22,ELAINE,"Yeah, I bumped in to her on the street. It got pretty ugly."
S08E22,JERRY,Cat fight with Raquel Welch.
S08E22,KRAMER,Yey eye ca-catfight.
S08E22,ELAINE,"My god, George!"
S08E22,GEORGE,I slipped on the invitations...how's the towels?
S08E22,JERRY,Back on the rack.
S08E22,GEORGE,With the two of us?
S08E22,JERRY,I think we're still a man short.
S08E22,DOCTOR,"Mr. Costanza. ..your legs have sustained extensive trauma. Apparently your body was in the state of advanced atrophy, due to a period of extreme inactivity. But with a lot of hard work and a little bit of luck, I think there's a good chance you may, one day, walk again."
S08E22,KRAMER,"Well, that's good news."
S08E22,ELAINE,"Wow, invitations again..."
S08E22,KRAMER,"Yeah, that's weird."
S08E22,ELAINE,"All right, well...you want to grab some coffee?"
S08E22,JERRY,Yeah...
S08E22,KRAMER,I'd like to get some coffee.
S08E22,GEORGE,This was supposed to be 'The summer of George'! The summer of George.
S08E22,THERAPIST,"Now, swing them...swing...swing them, just swing them."
S08E22,SAM,I can't do it. It's hard!
S08E22,GEORGE,Still a little summer left.
S09E01,GEORGE,What is Holland?
S09E01,JERRY,"(also wearing a moustache) What do you mean, 'what is it?' It's a country right next to Belgium."
S09E01,GEORGE,"No, that's the Netherlands."
S09E01,JERRY,Holland *is* the Netherlands.
S09E01,GEORGE,Then who are the Dutch?
S09E01,JERRY,(picking at his moustache) You know I cannot stand this thing anymore.
S09E01,GEORGE,"I know, I hate it too. I feel like an out of work porn star."
S09E01,JERRY,"I told you, we should have taken some kind of vacation."
S09E01,GEORGE,Well why didn't we?
S09E01,JERRY,Because you said this would be better. Remember? A vacation from ourselves. That's what you said.
S09E01,GEORGE,What if we grew muttonchops?
S09E01,JERRY,No.
S09E01,GEORGE,Buzz cuts? Parachute pants!
S09E01,JERRY,"Stop it, George. Stop it. I'm sorry, you've gotta get a job."
S09E01,GEORGE,(resigned) Dammit.
S09E01,GEORGE,"Hey hey hey, check me out, huh?"
S09E01,JERRY,"No more crutches, that must be a relief."
S09E01,GEORGE,"Yeah, with crutches everyone has questions."
S09E01,JERRY,Not with a cane?
S09E01,GEORGE,"Nah, with crutches it's a funny story, with a cane it's a sad story. You through with those?"
S09E01,JERRY,"That is a sad story. Hey, you should have been here tonight. Some guy from NBC saw my set, he wants me to do a showcase. I might have another shot at a pilot."
S09E01,GEORGE,"Alright, we're back in!"
S09E01,JERRY,We? No.
S09E01,CLUB ANNOUNCER,"(off camera) Ladies and gentlemen, Kenny Bania."
S09E01,BANIA,"Thank you, thank you, (To Jerry) Hey, Jerry, did ya see me up there? I was killing, Jerry. Killing. I killed."
S09E01,JERRY,Killed?
S09E01,BANIA,"Killed. (pause) I'm gonna go pick up some chicks. Good-looking ones, too! (walking away) Hey, what's your name?"
S09E01,JERRY,"Yeah, killed. Because I killed first and warmed up the crowd. He's like that fish that attaches himself to the shark."
S09E01,GEORGE,And you're the shark?
S09E01,JERRY,"Yeah, I'm the shark and he's the fish eating my laughs."
S09E01,GEORGE,I don't know how a fish could eat laughs.
S09E01,JERRY,"Well, I'm glad I brought it up."
S09E01,KRAMER,You got any shredded coconut?
S09E01,JERRY,"(looking at Kramer's moustache) Uh, we're not doing that anymore."
S09E01,KRAMER,"Yeah, yeah, right. (walks out)"
S09E01,GEORGE,(on the phone) Oh my God.
S09E01,JERRY,What?
S09E01,GEORGE,I got a job interview. They want to see me this afternoon.
S09E01,JERRY,So what's this job?
S09E01,GEORGE,"Oh, it's beautiful. It's in sports."
S09E01,JERRY,Knicks? Rangers?
S09E01,GEORGE,Playground equipment.
S09E01,JERRY,Welcome back to the show.
S09E01,GEORGE,Yeah haha.
S09E01,KRAMER,"Yeah, this is better. So, you got any shredded coconut?"
S09E01,JERRY,No.
S09E01,GEORGE,(holding his cane) I gotta hobble. (walks out)
S09E01,KRAMER,D-d-d-d. I gotta switch shaving creams. I'm getting no protection.
S09E01,JERRY,What kind do you use?
S09E01,KRAMER,Whatever you get.
S09E01,JERRY,"(nods) Look, postcard from Elaine from Europe."
S09E01,KRAMER,Don't tell me she's dragging another poor guy across Europe.
S09E01,JERRY,Remember David Puddy?
S09E01,KRAMER,"Oh, the face-painting auto mechanic. So she's dating him again, huh?"
S09E01,JERRY,"Well, I guess she's batted around and she's back at the top of the order."
S09E01,KRAMER,"Boy, a month in Europe with Elaine. (whistles) That guy's coming home in a body bag."
S09E01,PUDDY,"Well, let's see, I've got a ten kroner, a five kroner, a twenty kroner? No wait, that's another ten kroner. A fimty kroner? How much is that?"
S09E01,ELAINE,We have to break up.
S09E01,PUDDY,What?
S09E01,ELAINE,"I can't take this anymore! I don't want to hear how interesting the change with the hole in it is! And if you tell me what time it is in New York again, you are going home in a body bag!"
S09E01,PUDDY,Well what about you? What do you think The Gap in Rome has that's not in The Gap on Broadway?
S09E01,ELAINE,"Okay, alright listen. Forget about The Gap because we are through!"
S09E01,PUDDY,Fine!
S09E01,ELAINE,Fine!
S09E01,CAB DRIVER,"Okay, terminal three. Have a nice flight."
S09E01,CAPTAIN,"Ladies and gentlemen, our flight time, with stopovers, will be approximately 22 hours."
S09E01,ELAINE,"(to flight attendant) Hey, you gonna bust out that drink cart or what?"
S09E01,KRAMER,"Hey, what are you doing?"
S09E01,JERRY,"Oh, I'm taking this lace out. It came undone and touched the floor of a men's room. That's the end of that."
S09E01,KRAMER,Did you see Bania's set last night? 'Cause I read on the Internet he killed.
S09E01,JERRY,He killed. He only does well when he has me for a lead-in. He's a time slot hit.
S09E01,KRAMER,"Jerry, you gotta give him some credit. (starts rubbing a stick of Jerry's butter across his face) You're just being totally ridiculous. (keeps rubbing) I'll see you later buddy."
S09E01,JERRY,"Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait a minute."
S09E01,KRAMER,What?
S09E01,JERRY,Do I have to ask?
S09E01,KRAMER,"I ran out of butter so I had to borrow yours. Anything else, Mr. Nosy?"
S09E01,JERRY,Why are you buttering your face?
S09E01,KRAMER,I'm shaving with it.
S09E01,JERRY,Oh Moses smell the roses.
S09E01,KRAMER,"Jerry, it's vastly superior to any commercial shaving cream. The shave is close and clean, and the natural emolients keep my skin silky-smooth. Now feel my face."
S09E01,JERRY,No.
S09E01,KRAMER,Feel it.
S09E01,JERRY,I don't want to.
S09E01,KRAMER,Feel it. Feel it.
S09E01,JERRY,(places two slices of bread against Kramer's face) That is close.
S09E01,GEORGE,I got the job?
S09E01,MR. THOMASSOULO,"George, everybody here at Play Now is very impressed with you. I, I'm sure you heard that."
S09E01,GEORGE,"Well, no."
S09E01,MR.THOMASSOULO,"Now I don't want you to think that anyone's gonna treat you any differently just because of your, uh, (clears his throat) handicap."
S09E01,GEORGE,"Handicap? (gesturing to his cane) Oh, I'm not handicapped."
S09E01,MR. THOMASSOULO,"I'm sorry. Differently, uh, advantaged."
S09E01,GEORGE,"Yeah, I didn't mean that."
S09E01,MR. THOMASSOULO,"Of course you will have your own private, fully equipped bathroom."
S09E01,GEORGE,(shocked) When do I start?
S09E01,MR. THOMASSOULO,"Whenever you feel that you're able. (rises to show George out) Um, you need a hand here."
S09E01,GEORGE,"(Thomassoulo helps George get up) Yeah, what the hell."
S09E01,JERRY,You got the job?
S09E01,GEORGE,"Jerry, it's fantastic. I love the people over there. They- they treat me so great. You know they think I'm handicapped, they gave me this incredible office, a great view."
S09E01,JERRY,"Hold on, they think you're handicapped?"
S09E01,GEORGE,"Yeah, yeah, well, because of the cane. You should see the bathroom they gave me!"
S09E01,JERRY,How can you do this?
S09E01,GEORGE,"Jerry, let's face it, I've always been handicapped. I'm just now getting the recognition for it. Name one thing I have that puts me in a position of advantage. Huh? There was a guy that worked at the Yankees-- no arms! He got more work done than I did, made more money, had a wife, a family, drove a better car than I did."
S09E01,JERRY,He drove a car with no arms?
S09E01,GEORGE,"All right, I made up the part about the car, but the rest is true. And he hated me anyway!"
S09E01,JERRY,Do you know how hard it's getting just to tell people I know you?
S09E01,GEORGE,"I love that bathroom. It's got that high, high toilet. I feel like a gargoyle perched on the ledge of a building."
S09E01,KRAMER,Hey! They hooked me up.
S09E01,GEORGE,What's with all the butter?
S09E01,KRAMER,"I'm shaving with it, and you know what I discovered?"
S09E01,JERRY,You can eat it?
S09E01,KRAMER,"No, my face feels so good, I'm gonna use it all over my body."
S09E01,JERRY,"Oh my god, it's Bania and Jenna."
S09E01,GEORGE,Who?
S09E01,JERRY,The tooth brush in the toilet bowl.
S09E01,BANIA,"Hey Jerry, this is Jenna. Pretty good-lookin' huh?"
S09E01,JENNA,"Uh, Jerry's the guy that I dated right before you."
S09E01,BANIA,Oh. This is awkward.
S09E01,JENNA,"Don't worry, Kenny. After dating Jerry, you're a pleasure."
S09E01,JERRY,I don't believe this.
S09E01,GEORGE,"You miss her, don't you?"
S09E01,JERRY,"No! He's riding my coattails again. He's getting everything off me, first laughs now ladies."
S09E01,GEORGE,You miss her.
S09E01,PUDDY,"(to flight attendant) You know I think ultimately, I'm upset with myself. I knew what I was getting into, she's a bitter, unstable person. I mean the sex was good. I'm sure it was fine for her. I need more."
S09E01,ELAINE,(to another passenger) Huh. You believing this?
S09E01,PASSENGER,"Excuse me, I...I was sleeping."
S09E01,ELAINE,You missed quite a performance.
S09E01,PASSENGER,(disbelieving) That's my apple juice.
S09E01,JERRY,Someone's cooking.
S09E01,NEWMAN,"Hello, Jerry."
S09E01,JERRY,"Hello, Newman."
S09E01,NEWMAN,"You know, old friend, sometimes I ponder this silly gulf between us and I say, ""Why?"" Are we really so different. For what is--"
S09E01,JERRY,"(cutting in) I'm not the one doing the cooking, Newman."
S09E01,NEWMAN,"Damn you Seinfeld. You useless pustule. Um, somebody's got something on the griddle. maybe it's Kramer."
S09E01,JERRY,"No, he's up on the roof getting some sun with the butter (pauses) Oh no!"
S09E01,NEWMAN,Butter?
S09E01,PASSENGER,(explaining the coins to Elaine) This is the fimty kroner.
S09E01,ELAINE,"(to passenger) Oh? You know my last boyfriend, he had a real kroner comprehension problem. Know what I mean? A real cement head."
S09E01,WOMAN,"David, you are so funny."
S09E01,PUDDY,"Yeah, I know."
S09E01,ELAINE,(grabbing Puddy) What are you doing?
S09E01,PUDDY,"It's a long flight, Elaine. I had to get on with my life."
S09E01,ELAINE,By making time with some floozy across the aisle?
S09E01,PUDDY,"Yeah, that's right. Well, what's going on over there with you and, uh, Vegetable Lasagna?"
S09E01,ELAINE,This guy? He's an idiot. he doesn't mean anything to me.
S09E01,PASSENGER,(hereon known as Vegetable Lasagna) I can hear you.
S09E01,PUDDY,"Well, she doesn't mean anything to me either. If it were up to me, we'd still be together."
S09E01,ELAINE,Well maybe I feel the same way.
S09E01,PUDDY,Ok.
S09E01,ELAINE,"Ok, so now what?"
S09E01,PUDDY,Let's make out.
S09E01,JERRY,Kramer!
S09E01,KRAMER,"Oh, man. I think I cooked myself."
S09E01,JERRY,Look at your skin.
S09E01,KRAMER,"Stick a fork in me, Jerry. I'm done."
S09E01,KRAMER,I'm fried.
S09E01,JERRY,"Technically, you're sauted. So, what are you doing for that?"
S09E01,KRAMER,"Well, I just gotta keep my skin moist so I don't dry out."
S09E01,JERRY,Is that what the doctor said?
S09E01,KRAMER,"No, I read an article in Bon Appetit magazine. (grabs a baster) I'll see you later."
S09E01,JERRY,Yea.
S09E01,KRAMER,Hey.
S09E01,GEORGE,Hey.
S09E01,KRAMER,How you doing? (Kramer leaves)
S09E01,GEORGE,(sniffing) Hmm. Game hen?
S09E01,JERRY,"Kind of. Nice limp, you're bringing your work home with you?"
S09E01,GEORGE,"No, I fake limp on my right. This is a real limp because I sprained my ankle."
S09E01,JERRY,What happened?
S09E01,GEORGE,"Well, I was buttering myself up for a nice shave --"
S09E01,JERRY,"Oh no, not you too?"
S09E01,GEORGE,I must have dripped some on the floor and I slipped and...
S09E01,JERRY,You know what's good for that? Relish.
S09E01,JERRY,"Hello? Yeah, this is Jerry Seinfeld. What? No. No! No! No!! No!!! Thank you. (Hangs up.) I don't believe this. They've added Bania to the network showcase and he's going on right after me."
S09E01,GEORGE,"So what, he's got a couple of good jokes."
S09E01,JERRY,"Oh, like what, Ovaltine? Why do dogs drink out of the toilet? Shopping carts with one bad wheel?"
S09E01,GEORGE,"That's true, that always happens to me."
S09E01,JERRY,You think that's funny?
S09E01,GEORGE,"I don't know, I like stuff you don't have to think about too much."
S09E01,JERRY,You like Bania's act. You're a closet Bania fan!
S09E01,GEORGE,Maybe I am.
S09E01,JERRY,"Oh, I'm gonna puke."
S09E01,GEORGE,Puke! That's a funny word. Puke. (laughing) Puke! Don't have to think about that.
S09E01,ELAINE,I can't believe we broke up like that.
S09E01,PUDDY,It was stupid.
S09E01,ELAINE,Do you want something to read?
S09E01,PUDDY,No I'm good.
S09E01,ELAINE,"Well, are you going to take a nap or --"
S09E01,PUDDY,No.
S09E01,ELAINE,You're just going to sit there staring at the back of a seat?
S09E01,PUDDY,Yeah.
S09E01,ELAINE,"That's it! I cannot take this! I mean, look at this, nothing has changed. We've been back together two hours, we're having the same problems we had 12 hours ago."
S09E01,PUDDY,"Tell me about it, I don't know why I ever took you back."
S09E01,ELAINE,"Oh, please! I took you back. You know it, I know it, Vegetable Lasagna here knows it."
S09E01,VEGETABLE LASAGNA,"Please, please, I don't want to get involved."
S09E01,ELAINE,"Ugh, I hope a giant mountain rises out of the ocean and we just ram right into it and end this whole thing!"
S09E01,VEGETABLE LASAGNA,Oh God.
S09E01,PASSENGER 2,Ow! Ow!!
S09E01,NEWMAN,"How much longer you gonna be, I'm starving here."
S09E01,KRAMER,Just a few more squirts. Cause I gotta stay juicy.
S09E01,NEWMAN,"That smell. It's still with you, huh?"
S09E01,KRAMER,"Yeah, it's baked on in. Hey, put another stick of butter in."
S09E01,NEWMAN,Here.
S09E01,KRAMER,"Yeah, stir it up so it melts."
S09E01,KRAMER,"Oh yea that feels good. Ahh, now I'm simmering."
S09E01,NEWMAN,I'll meet you at the coffee shop.
S09E01,MR. THOMASSOULO,"Good morning, George."
S09E01,GEORGE,"Good morning, sir."
S09E01,MR. THOMASSOULO,Is there something wrong with your other leg?
S09E01,GEORGE,"Oh, no, that's just the old, uh, the old handicap acting up."
S09E01,MR. THOMASSOULO,But your cane's on the wrong side.
S09E01,GEORGE,"Oh well, that's, uh, thats just because we're, uh, standing on opposite sides."
S09E01,MR.THOMASSOULO,Huh?
S09E01,GEORGE,"Yeah, see, uh, when we met, I was over there and, uh, you were over here, so the image, uh, the image was reversed, like, uh, like in the mirror."
S09E01,GEORGE,"See? This looks right to you, doesn't it?"
S09E01,MR. THOMASSOULO,"Uh, yeah, I guess."
S09E01,GEORGE,"(passes cane from right to left and back a few times) But, see here. Right. Wrong. Right. Wrong. Right. Right. Wrong--"
S09E01,MR. THOMASSOULO,"Will you stop it, George? Just stop it! I think I can see what's going on here."
S09E01,GEORGE,"Well, you're not gonna believe what happened."
S09E01,JERRY,You mugged Stephen Hawking?
S09E01,GEORGE,"Play Now thinks I got problems in both legs. My own personal Rascal, Jerry. On the house."
S09E01,JERRY,Well it must be comforting to know you'll be going straight to hell at no more than three miles an hour.
S09E01,JERRY,Hello?
S09E01,ELAINE,Jerry.
S09E01,JERRY,"Hey, Lainie, how's the trip going?"
S09E01,ELAINE,Awful. This trip was a *huge* mistake. Huge!
S09E01,VEGETABLE LASAGNA,Please don't shout. I can't take it.
S09E01,JERRY,Who's that?
S09E01,ELAINE,It's Vegetable Lasagna.
S09E01,JERRY,Who?
S09E01,ELAINE,Vegetable Lasagna!
S09E01,VEGETABLE LASAGNA,My name is Magnus.
S09E01,ELAINE,Shut up or I'll snap you in half and stuff you in the overhead!
S09E01,JERRY,Get me some duty free Kahlua.
S09E01,GEORGE,How's the trip?
S09E01,JERRY,Sounded good.
S09E01,GEORGE,Well. Gotta motor.
S09E01,JERRY,"Hey, if you got any juice left, you might wanna roll by the big showcase tonight."
S09E01,GEORGE,"Ah, you still going on in front of Bania, eh?"
S09E01,JERRY,"That's right, and I'll tell you what. I'm feeling a little off."
S09E01,GEORGE,What are you talking about? (Jerry grins) You're not!
S09E01,JERRY,"That's right, I'm taking a dive."
S09E01,GEORGE,You're throwing the set?
S09E01,JERRY,"I'm laying down! Then we'll see how he does up there, without all the assistance."
S09E01,GEORGE,"Listen Jerry. With all due respect, Bania's voice is the voice of a new generation. My generation."
S09E01,JERRY,We're four months apart.
S09E01,GEORGE,Nevertheless. His time has come.
S09E01,GEORGE,"Now if you will kindly help me unwedge my front wheel, I'll be on my way."
S09E01,NEWMAN,Butter. Kramer. Butter. Kramer.
S09E01,KRAMER/Turkey,(waving wing) Hey buddy.
S09E01,KRAMER,"Jerry, what are you doing? George tells me you're gonna throw your set?"
S09E01,JERRY,"That's right, Choochie. Let's see how Bania does without the cushy timeslot."
S09E01,CLUB ANNOUNCER,"(OC) Ladies and gentlemen, Jerry Seinfeld!"
S09E01,JERRY,If you'll excuse me.
S09E01,KRAMER,"Whoa, man!"
S09E01,JERRY,(OC) Hey everybody! Who's ready to laugh?
S09E01,JERRY,"What's the deal with lampshades? I mean if it's a lamp, why do you want shade?"
S09E01,JERRY,And what's with people getting sick?
S09E01,NEWMAN,Hee hee! Yeah yeah!
S09E01,JERRY,"I mean, what's the deal with cancer?"
S09E01,MAN IN AUDIENCE,I have cancer!
S09E01,KRAMER,"Oh, tough crowd."
S09E01,MAN,"Hey, hey! You dented my ride."
S09E01,GEORGE,"Whatcha got there, the 4-volt? Heh, I did you a favor."
S09E01,MAN,How about I do you a favor upside your head?
S09E01,GEORGE,Oh yeah?
S09E01,MAN,Oh yeah.
S09E01,MAN,Hey!
S09E01,WOMAN,Get the bikes.
S09E01,BANIA,Ouch.
S09E01,KRAMER,"Well, that wasn't so bad, huh?"
S09E01,JERRY,What are you talking about? I bombed!
S09E01,KRAMER,"No, you had some good stuff. The cancer bit? I mean, it was edgy, it was not my sort of thing but some of those people out there, they really liked it."
S09E01,JERRY,Like who?
S09E01,KRAMER,"Well, that guy who yelled out."
S09E01,JERRY,He *had* cancer!
S09E01,KRAMER,And laughter is the best medicine.
S09E01,JERRY,"Hey, sorry Kenny. Guess you got your work cut out for you."
S09E01,CLUB ANNOUNCER,"(OC) Ladies and gentlemen, Kenny Bania!"
S09E01,KRAMER,"Hey, Jerry, he could have used your laugh. He was a big turkey out there."
S09E01,NEWMAN,(salivating) Turkey?
S09E01,KRAMER,A big fat turkey.
S09E01,NEWMAN,I'm sorry I missed that.
S09E01,KRAMER,"I tell ya, he worked so hard and then he just--"
S09E01,KRAMER,"What is this, oregano?"
S09E01,KRAMER,"Look at me! I'm all covered in oregano and Parmesan, and it's sticking to me because of the butter! Look at me!"
S09E01,NEWMAN,Here. Hold this.
S09E01,KRAMER,"What is this, parsley?"
S09E01,JERRY,"Ah, the sweet stench of failure."
S09E01,KRAMER,"Ah you bit me. Get off of me, get off of me!"
S09E01,MAN,Now I got you!
S09E01,MR. THOMASSOULO,George? Your legs!
S09E01,GEORGE,"Are you a religious man, sir?"
S09E01,MR. THOMASSOULO,No.
S09E01,MAN,Eat hickory!!
S09E01,BANIA,"Hey Jerry, didja see it?"
S09E01,JERRY,Ouch.
S09E01,STU,"Kenny! There you are. Jay Shermak and Stu Crespi from NBC. Listen, Kenny. Really funny out there."
S09E01,JERRY,What?
S09E01,JAY,That thing you did having the two guys running through? I love stuff you don't have to think too much about.
S09E01,STU,Give us a call. We want to be in the Kenny Bania business.
S09E01,JAY,"By the way, Jerry? The suspenders? A little hacky."
S09E01,BANIA,How about that Jerry? First you had a pilot on NBC and now I'll have one. Looks like I'm following you again.
S09E01,JERRY,"Oh, I'm gonna puke."
S09E01,BANIA,Puke? That's a funny word. Can I use that?
S09E01,ELAINE,"David, this has been the worst month of my life and if I never see you again it'll be too soon."
S09E01,PUDDY,Ditto.
S09E01,ELAINE,Oh that's origi-
S09E01,PUDDY,Go to Hell.
S09E01,ELAINE,86th and Broadway please.
S09E01,CAB DRIVER,"I'm sorry lady, there's a cab shortage. The Transit Police are making everybody share."
S09E01,ELAINE,Oh no.
S09E01,VEGETABLE LASAGNA,Hello! (sees Elaine) Oh no. I'm sorry.
S09E01,ELAINE,Noooooooooooo!
S09E02,[Scene,In the Play Now office]
S09E02,THOMASSOULO,"George, youre not really handicapped, are you?"
S09E02,GEORGE,Ive had my difficulties.
S09E02,THOMASSOULO,I saw you running down Amsterdam Avenue lifting that 200 pound motorized cart with one hand.
S09E02,GEORGE,"Mr. Thomassoulo during times of great stress, people are capable of super human strength. Have you ever seen the Incredible Hulk, sir?"
S09E02,THOMASSOULO,No
S09E02,GEORGE,How about the old Spider Man live action show?
S09E02,THOMASSOULO,"George, Ive realized weve signed a one-year contract with you, but at this point I think its best that we both go our separate ways."
S09E02,GEORGE,I dont understand.
S09E02,THOMASSOULO,We dont like you. We want you to leave.
S09E02,GEORGE,Clearer
S09E02,[Scene,At Monks Caf]
S09E02,JERRY,So youre staying at Play Now?
S09E02,GEORGE,"Why not? Pay is good. I got dental, private access to one of the great handicapped toilets in the city."
S09E02,JERRY,"But they not you arent handicapped, arent you ashamed?"
S09E02,GEORGE,"Theyre the ones who should be ashamed. They signed me to a one-year contract. As long as I show up for work every day, they have to pay me."
S09E02,ELAINE,Hey
S09E02,JERRY & GEORGE,(doing the voice) Hello-o-o-o!
S09E02,GEORGE,Hello-o-o-o Elaine!
S09E02,ELAINE,Whats that?
S09E02,JERRY,"Oh, its just this stupid thing."
S09E02,ELAINE,"Well, Im sure its stupid. Its not about me, is it?"
S09E02,JERRY,(doing the voice) No-o-o-o.
S09E02,GEORGE,(doing the voice) Not at all.
S09E02,ELAINE,Tell me!
S09E02,JERRY,All right. You know this girl Clare I am seeing?
S09E02,ELAINE,Yeah.
S09E02,JERRY,"Well, he and I starting joking that when she falls asleep her stomach stays awake all night and talks to me."
S09E02,ELAINE,How is it talking?
S09E02,JERRY,"Well, her belly button is like a mouth. (doing the voice) Im bored. Talk to me."
S09E02,ELAINE,"Oh I gotta start taking these ""stupid"" warnings more seriously."
S09E02,JERRY,"Hey, look whose here - Puddy."
S09E02,ELAINE,My Puddy? But we broke up.
S09E02,JERRY,And yet he continues to live.
S09E02,PUDDY,"Hey Benes, How are you?"
S09E02,ELAINE,Im doing great.
S09E02,PUDDY,Great. (pauses) See ya.
S09E02,JERRY,"Well, thats it. You two are back together."
S09E02,ELAINE,What?
S09E02,JERRY,The bump into. The bump into always leads to the backslide.
S09E02,ELAINE,David and I will not be getting back together.
S09E02,JERRY,"Elaine, breaking up is like knocking over a coke machine. You cant do it in one push, you got to rock it back and forth a few times, and then it goes over."
S09E02,GEORGE,Thats beautiful.
S09E02,ELAINE,"What about you? You were even engaged, and you cut it off just like that."
S09E02,JERRY,"Thats different. I didnt have feelings for those people. But you, youll backslide"
S09E02,ELAINE,You want to bet?
S09E02,JERRY,Stakes?
S09E02,ELAINE,50
S09E02,JERRY,Dollars?
S09E02,ELAINE,All right. Witness? (looks at George).
S09E02,GEORGE,Witness.
S09E02,JERRY,Done.
S09E02,GEORGE,Percentage?
S09E02,JERRY & ELAINE,No.
S09E02,[Scene,At Jerrys apartment]
S09E02,CLARE,So Ill call you tonight?
S09E02,JERRY,Yeah.
S09E02,CLARE,Whats wrong with the belt?
S09E02,JERRY,"I went to the movies last night, I went to the bathroom and I unbuckled a little wobbly and the buckle kind of banged against the side of the urinal. So(throws away belt) thats it!"
S09E02,CLARE,"So, youre insane?"
S09E02,JERRY,"Oh yes, quite."
S09E02,KRAMER,Hello!
S09E02,JERRY,Of course its a sliding scale.
S09E02,CLARE,Catch you later.
S09E02,KRAMER & JERRY,(doing the voice) Hello-o-o-o! (haha)
S09E02,JERRY,(doing the voice) La la la.
S09E02,KRAMER,(doing the voice) La la la.
S09E02,KRAMER,"Look at this, they are redoing the Cloud Club."
S09E02,JERRY,"Oh, that restaurant on top of the Chrysler building? Yeah, thats a good idea."
S09E02,KRAMER,"Of course its a good idea, its my idea. I conceived this whole project two years ago."
S09E02,JERRY,Which part? The renovating the restaurant you dont own part or spending the two hundred million you dont have part?
S09E02,KRAMER,"You see I come up with these things, I know theyre gold, but nothing happens. You know why?"
S09E02,JERRY,"No resources, no skill, no talent, no ability, no brains."
S09E02,KRAMER,"(interrupts) No, notime! Its all this meaningless time. Laundry, grocery, shopping, coming in here talking to you. Do you have any idea how much time I waste in this apartment?"
S09E02,JERRY,I can ball park it.
S09E02,ELAINE,(doing the voice) Hello-o-o-o!
S09E02,KRAMER,Here we go; now she comes in. Now my whole day is shot!
S09E02,JERRY,"Hey, I called you last night, where were you?"
S09E02,ELAINE,(looking VERY guilty) I went out with a (fake cough) a friend.
S09E02,JERRY,George?
S09E02,ELAINE,"(looking guiltier) No, nono."
S09E02,JERRY,"Well, I was here, thats everyone (laughing)."
S09E02,ELAINE,(laughing).
S09E02,JERRY,Are those the same shoes as yesterday?
S09E02,ELAINE,"Oh, you know I wear these shoes all the time."
S09E02,JERRY,"Your hair, its somewhat de-poofed."
S09E02,ELAINE,Its the new look. You know Heroin Cheek?
S09E02,JERRY,"Wait a second, whats going on here?"
S09E02,ELAINE,"Nothing, nothing."
S09E02,JERRY,(screams).
S09E02,ELAINE,(screams).
S09E02,JERRY,Youre wearing the same clothes as yesterday!!! (pauses) You saw Puddy!
S09E02,KRAMER,Hoochie moochie. (haha)
S09E02,JERRY,Hand it over. Pay up.
S09E02,ELAINE,"No! Its an isolated, sexual incident. We are not back together!"
S09E02,JERRY,Then what do you call it? People dont just bump into each other and have sex. This isnt cinemax.
S09E02,ELAINE,"It was no big deal OK? I mean we fooled around, then we went out and grabbed a little dinner."
S09E02,JERRY,"Ah, dinner! Thats it, youre all the way back!"
S09E02,ELAINE,Ugh!
S09E02,JERRY,"Sex, thats meaningless, I can understand that, but dinner; thats heavy. Thats like an hour."
S09E02,KRAMER,"(still reading the paper) Man, 2.9 percent financing on a Toyota Onedun (Sp?). That was my idea too!"
S09E02,[Scene,At Play Now]
S09E02,GEORGE,Good Morning!
S09E02,CO-WORKER,Go to hell!
S09E02,GEORGE,"Hi Allison, thats a nice dress."
S09E02,ALLISON,Dont even look at me.
S09E02,GEORGE,Hey Glenn!
S09E02,GLENN,"Hey, go tell hell!"
S09E02,GEORGE,Heard that one already.
S09E02,[Scene,At Jerrys apartment]
S09E02,KRAMER,"So thats the bedroom. Heres the bathroom. If you need to, you can familiarize yourself with the kitchenYeah, go ahead and look through some of the drawers."
S09E02,JERRY,And you are?
S09E02,DARREN,"Oh, hey, Im Darren. Im new here."
S09E02,KRAMER,"Yeah, thats Jerry, you dont have to worry about him. Why dont you go across the hall and get started on that mail."
S09E02,DARREN,Right!
S09E02,KRAMER,Hes a go getter!
S09E02,JERRY,Whos he?
S09E02,KRAMER,"My intern from NYU. Well, you remember my corporation, Kramerica Industries."
S09E02,JERRY,Alright.
S09E02,KRAMER,"Well, apparently NYU is very enthusiastic about their students getting some real world corporate experience."
S09E02,JERRY,But you only provide fantasy world corporate experience.
S09E02,KRAMER,"Well, this will really free up my time so I can focus on more important things, like my bladder system."
S09E02,JERRY,"Alright, its time to go."
S09E02,KRAMER,"Jerry, its not for people, its for oil tankers."
S09E02,JERRY,(sarcastically) I know!
S09E02,KRAMER,"You see the idea is for a rubber ball inside the tanker so if it crashes, the oil wont spill out."
S09E02,JERRY,"Actually, that is not a bad idea."
S09E02,KRAMER,(smiles) yeah.
S09E02,JERRY,"Now, its time to go."
S09E02,JERRY,Hello
S09E02,GEORGE,(doing the voice) Hello-o-o-o. (Hes sitting on the floor in his Play Now office).
S09E02,JERRY,"(doing the voice) Hello-o-o-o. (pauses) So, whats going on?"
S09E02,GEORGE,"Siege mentality, Jerry. They really want me out of here. Theyve downgraded me to some sort of a bunker. Im like Hitlers last days here."
S09E02,JERRY,"So, are you going to leave?"
S09E02,GEORGE,"Oh no! Im vigilant. Theyll never get me out. Im like a weed, Jerry."
S09E02,JERRY,I thought youre like Hitler in the bunker?
S09E02,GEORGE,Im a weed in Hitlers bunker.
S09E02,JERRY,"Im getting a little uncomfortable with the Hitler stuff. (his other line beeps) Im getting another call, see ya(answers call) Hello!"
S09E02,DARREN,"Hi, this is Darren from Kramers office. Mr. Kramer would like to schedule a lunch with you at Monks coffee shop."
S09E02,JERRY,(looking shocked) Really? When?
S09E02,DARREN,In 10 minutes. Do you need directions?
S09E02,JERRY,"No, I dont."
S09E02,DARREN,"Well, Ill call back in 5 minutes to confirm."
S09E02,KRAMER,"Yeah, 5."
S09E02,ELAINE,Hey!
S09E02,JERRY,"Hey! So, wheres my money?"
S09E02,ELAINE,"No money, I am Puddy free. So, are we eating or what?"
S09E02,JERRY,"Oh yeah, hold on."
S09E02,JERRY,"Hello Darren, this is Jerry from Jerrys office. (Elaine is looking confused). Were going to be three for lunch. (Elaine is still looking confused) What do you mean hes already left?"
S09E02,JERRY,"Hey, Elaine is going to come with us, alright?"
S09E02,KRAMER,What? When did this happen?
S09E02,JERRY,"Well, just"
S09E02,KRAMER,(yelling) DARREN!
S09E02,[Scene,At Elaines apartment]
S09E02,ELAINE,"I am not calling Puddy. What did I do with my gloves? Oh, I bet I left them over at Puddys. I should call him. I need those gloves. No, I better not. Ill call. (looks at table) Oh, look at that! There are the gloves. I was just about to call. There they are. Thats funny. Thats really funny. Thats really really funny. You know who loves funny stories, David Puddy. (Picks up phone)."
S09E02,[Scene,At Monks Cafe]
S09E02,GEORGE,"Well, Play Now is through playing. They turned the heat way up in my office. They tried to sweat me out."
S09E02,JERRY,Do you have to write all this stuff down.
S09E02,DARREN,"Well, Mr. Kramer is in a meeting with Mr. Lohmase and he didnt want to miss anything."
S09E02,JERRY,"So, how hot did it get?"
S09E02,GEORGE,"I dont know, 120, 130Then they sent some guys to sandblast for 6 hours. Tomorrow they are putting in asbestos."
S09E02,JERRY,"I guess you can take anything, but actual work."
S09E02,GEORGE,Bring it on!
S09E02,GEORGE,(doing the voice) Hello-o-o-o Kramer!
S09E02,JERRY,(doing the voice) Wel-l-l-c-o-m-e!
S09E02,GEORGE,(doing the voice) La la la.
S09E02,KRAMER,"Sorry I couldnt get out of there, what did I miss? (asking his ""intern"")"
S09E02,DARREN,"Well, after ordering, Mr. Seinfeld and Mr. Costanza debated on whether or not iron man wore some sort under garment between his skin and his iron suit"
S09E02,KRAMER,Uh huh
S09E02,GEORGE,(Interrupts) And I still say hes naked under there!
S09E02,JERRY,Oh that makes a lot of sense.
S09E02,GEORGE,"Oh, shut up!"
S09E02,DARREN,"Then Mr. Seinfeld went to the restroom, at which point Mr. Costanza scooped ice out of Mr. Seinfelds drink with his bare hands using it to wash up (Jerry is taking a sip of water and looking mad) then Mr. Costanza remarked to me, ""This never happened."" (Jerry then spits out the water)."
S09E02,[Scene,At Jerrys apartment in his bed]
S09E02,JERRY,(giggling)
S09E02,CLARE,Whats so funny?
S09E02,JERRY,"Oh, nothing. (still giggling)"
S09E02,CLARE,What are you laughing about? Tell me.
S09E02,JERRY,"Oh all right, this is really dumb, really stupid. Weve been doing this silly, dumb voice."
S09E02,CLARE,So is it fun humiliating me?
S09E02,JERRY,"No, its not you. Its your stomach, hes taking with this funny, booming, jovial voice. (doing the voice) Hello-o-o-o."
S09E02,CLARE,So you think Im fat?
S09E02,JERRY,No its
S09E02,DARREN,"Mr. Kramer says, ""hey buddy!"""
S09E02,JERRY,"Hey, were kind of in the middle of something here. Would you mind coming back later?"
S09E02,DARREN,"Oh yeah sure, sure. Should we set something up now?"
S09E02,JERRY,(Screams) GET OUT!
S09E02,CLARE,Im leaving too.
S09E02,JERRY,"No body said youre fat. Hes a loving character, like the Kool-ade guy."
S09E02,CLARE,He is fat!
S09E02,JERRY,"No, hes just a little bloated."
S09E02,CLARE,Good-bye!
S09E02,JERRY,Its mostly water weight.
S09E02,KRAMER,"Boysenberry, the kid is still learning."
S09E02,DARREN,"Mr. KramerDean, my internship is on line two, she wants to set up a meeting."
S09E02,KRAMER,"Yeah, well nothing before noon."
S09E02,JERRY,Line two?
S09E02,KRAMER,"Yeah, your phone is line one."
S09E02,JERRY,Oh
S09E02,[Scene,At Elaines apartment]
S09E02,PUDDY,So the gloves were right by the phone. That is pretty funny.
S09E02,ELAINE,"See, this is what Jerrys doesnt understand. We can see each other. We can see each other every day, but it doesnt mean we are back together."
S09E02,PUDDY,I mean I love just seeing you and having sex.
S09E02,ELAINE,Yeah.
S09E02,PUDDY,Not having to do all thatyou knowwork.
S09E02,ELAINE,"Well, either way"
S09E02,PUDDY,"All that calling you, and buying you stuff"
S09E02,ELAINE,David
S09E02,PUDDY,Caring about how everyone at work isnt as smart as you. Its brutal.
S09E02,ELAINE,Alright thats it! Were back together!
S09E02,PUDDY,"Oh, no."
S09E02,ELAINE,"Oh, yeah."
S09E02,PUDDY,"Look Elaine, be reasonable."
S09E02,ELAINE,Get those clothes off. Youre going to spend the night and were going to cuddle.
S09E02,PUDDY,What?
S09E02,ELAINE,You heard me. Strip!
S09E02,[Scene,At Play Now]
S09E02,GEORGE,(whistling).(laughing).AlrightOK.
S09E02,GEORGE,"(on phone  calling secretary) Hello Margery, George Costanza. How are you sweet heart? Listen, can you give Mr. Thomassoulo a message for me? Yes. If he needs me, tell him (screams) IM IN MY OFFICE! Thanks."
S09E02,[Scene,At NYU]
S09E02,KRAMER,"Dean Jones, you wanting to talk to me?"
S09E02,DEAN JONES,Ive been reviewing Darrens internship journal. Doing laundry
S09E02,KRAMER,Yeah.
S09E02,DEAN JONES,"Mending chicken wire, hi-tea with a Mr. Newman."
S09E02,KRAMER,"I know it sounds pretty glamorous, but its business as usual at Kramerica."
S09E02,DEAN JONES,As far as I can tell your entire enterprise is more than a solitary man with a messy apartment which may or may not contain a chicken.
S09E02,KRAMER,"And with Darrens help, well get that chicken."
S09E02,DEAN JONES,"Im sorry, but we cant allow Darren to continue working with you."
S09E02,KRAMER,"Well, I have to say this seems capricious and arbitrary."
S09E02,DEAN JONES,You fly is open.
S09E02,[Scene,At Jerrys apartment]
S09E02,JERRY,So youre sure youre not still angry about last night?
S09E02,CLARE,"No, Im fine. Just as long as you dont ever do that voice again."
S09E02,JERRY,Never?
S09E02,CLARE,Never.
S09E02,JERRY,What about if youre not around?
S09E02,CLARE,No!
S09E02,JERRY,So I have to choose between seeing you and doing the voice?
S09E02,CLARE,Thats right.
S09E02,JERRY,I can do that.
S09E02,CLARE,So whats your decision?
S09E02,JERRY,I dont know.
S09E02,CLARE,JerryHI.
S09E02,JERRY,(doing the voice) Hello-o-o-o. La-la-la. (haha)
S09E02,[Scene,At Jerrys apartment]
S09E02,GEORGE,You broke up with her? Why?
S09E02,JERRY,So we could do the voice. (doing the voice) La-la-la. Whats the matter?
S09E02,GEORGE,I think Im getting tired of it. I mean is that all it does? Hello? La-la-la?
S09E02,JERRY,"No, it can do anything. It can be Spanish. (doing the voice) Hola. Hello-o-o-o."
S09E02,GEORGE,I think I like the girl better than the voice.
S09E02,JERRY,Really?
S09E02,JERRY,(doing the voice) Hello-o-o-o.
S09E02,ELAINE,Still?
S09E02,GEORGE,I told you.
S09E02,ELAINE,"Alright, here you go, choke on it (hands him money)."
S09E02,JERRY,"See, never bet against the backslide. I knew you two would get back together."
S09E02,ELAINE,"Yeah, well not for long. Im breaking up with him."
S09E02,JERRY,"No, I dont think so. Ive seen you two together. You make each other miserable. Its kismet."
S09E02,ELAINE,Double or nothing.
S09E02,JERRY,Done.
S09E02,GEORGE,(talking from bathroom) Witness?
S09E02,JERRY,Youre in there again.
S09E02,GEORGE,I think Play Now is putting something in my food.
S09E02,ELAINE,"Alright, Im out of here."
S09E02,JERRY,What is this? (Kramer is wearing jeans that look like it doesnt fit him).
S09E02,KRAMER,I dont know. I found them in your closet. Ever since Darren left I havent been able to find anything. He took all my clothes to some cleaners. Im clueless. (looks at clock) Is that clock right?
S09E02,JERRY,Yeah. Nine oclock.
S09E02,KRAMER,I was supposed to pick up Newman at the zoo twelve hours ago.
S09E02,JERRY,(doing the voice) Good-bye Kramer.
S09E02,KRAMER,"Jerry, buddy, I got to tell you something. That voice is played."
S09E02,JERRY,Really?
S09E02,KRAMER,So played.
S09E02,GEORGE,I told you.
S09E02,[Scene,"Hallway, Darren is knocking on Kramers door]"
S09E02,KRAMER,Darren? What are you doing here? The college canceled the internship.
S09E02,DARREN,I dont care about the internship. I care about Kramerica.
S09E02,KRAMER,Kramerica is no more.
S09E02,DARREN,What about the oil tanker bladder system? We were going to put an end to maritime oil spills.
S09E02,KRAMER,"Probably. Darren, you go home. Forget about Kramerica."
S09E02,KRAMER,"Well, youre still here?"
S09E02,DARREN,I havent had time to leave.
S09E02,KRAMER,"Well, I havent changed my mind."
S09E02,KRAMER,"Well, you are a tenacious little monkey. Alright, Ill do it. Kramerica industries lives! Lets get back to work!"
S09E02,KRAMER,Lets see what Jerry has to eat.
S09E02,[Scene,At Play Now  in the bosses office]
S09E02,THOMASSOULO,"You win George. Weve had it. If you leave right now, Play Now will give you six months pay. Thats half of your entire contract. Pleasejust go."
S09E02,GEORGE,"You see if I stay the whole year, I get it all."
S09E02,THOMASSOULO,"Want to play hand ball huh? Fine. (calls on intercom) Attention Play Now employees, George Costanzas handicapped bathroom is now open on the sixteenth floor to all employees and their families."
S09E02,GEORGE,Well played.
S09E02,THOMASSOULO,Ill see you in hell Costanza.
S09E02,[Scene,At Jerrys apartment]
S09E02,JERRY,"(on the phone with Clare) Clare thanks for giving me a second chance. Our relationship is certainly worth more than some silly, stupid voice. Hold on one second. (George walks in  Jerry asks George) So we definitely dont want to do the voice anymore? (George shakes his head NO) Alright, were back together again, great. Bye bye."
S09E02,[Scene,Hallway  Kramer & Darren are pushing an oil tank]
S09E02,KRAMER,Hey.
S09E02,JERRY,Trouble down at the plant?
S09E02,KRAMER,Its a tank of oil. Darren and I are finally going to test out my bladder system.
S09E02,GEORGE,You have to drink that whole thing?
S09E02,KRAMER,No. No. No. Its for oil tankers. All I need to do is fill some sort of rubber container with oil and then drop it to see whether or not it can restrain the impact.
S09E02,JERRY,"I understand (not really understanding, lol)."
S09E02,GEORGE,Would a giant rubber ball work?
S09E02,KRAMER,Conceivably.
S09E02,GEORGE,"Well, Play Now has all kinds of different rubber balls. Why dont we test your bladder system at my office?"
S09E02,JERRY,Youre not
S09E02,GEORGE,"Oh, yes I am. Mr. Thomassoulo likes to play dirty. Well, theres nothing dirtier than a giant ball of oil."
S09E02,[Scene,At Monks Cafe]
S09E02,PUDDY,"Hey, you want to split a root beer (I think thats what he says)?"
S09E02,ELAINE,"I dont think so David, were through."
S09E02,PUDDY,OhThats a nice sweater (Elaine smiles).
S09E02,[Scene,At Elaines house  the two are in bed]
S09E02,ELAINE,Whew that was a dozy.
S09E02,[Scene,At Jerrys apartment]
S09E02,JERRY,Go again?
S09E02,ELAINE,Book it.
S09E02,GEORGE,(again from bathroom) Witness.
S09E02,[Scene,At Elaines apartment]
S09E02,ELAINE,"David I know this hurts, but its the way it has to be (Puddy is giving her a look like hes going to still get some)."

S09E02,JERRY,Ha ha ha. Ha ha ha ha.
S09E02,[Scene,Jerry and Elaine at the movies]
S09E02,ELAINE,Im going to get some popcorn.

S09E02,ELAINE,"So, how did it end?"
S09E02,JERRY,They got away.
S09E02,ELAINE,uh.
S09E02,[Scene,At Elaines apartment]
S09E02,ELAINE,"Listen David, Ive got to run. Can you lend me fifty bucks?"
S09E02,[Scene,At Play Now]
S09E02,JERRY,Hey.
S09E02,KRAMER,Did you bring the video camera?
S09E02,JERRY,"Yeah, I put a six hour tape in. That should cover the experiment, the arrest, and most of your trial. Alright, Ill see ya."
S09E02,GEORGE,"Oh, you might want to stick around Jerry. Mr. Thomassoulo picked the wrong man to hire because he was fake handicapped."
S09E02,JERRY,I cant. I got to meet Clare.
S09E02,KRAMER,You gave up the voice?
S09E02,JERRY,"Yeah, I thought it was stupid. Unless you guys are liking it again."
S09E02,KRAMER & GEORGE,No. No
S09E02,JERRY,Darren?
S09E02,DARREN,Sorry Mr. Seinfeld.
S09E02,JERRY,"Uh, bathroom."
S09E02,GEORGE,"Hey, use mine. Ill let you in."
S09E02,JERRY,I thought it was open to the public.
S09E02,GEORGE,"I uh, took care of that."
S09E02,JERRY,Wow! Zanadu . No wonder youre putting in so many hours. (looks at urinal) May I?
S09E02,GEORGE,I insist. Ill fix us a drink. (phone rings  who would that be?) I got it.
S09E02,KRAMER,"Whew. You know Darren, if you would have told me twenty-five years ago that some day Id be standing here about to solve the worlds energy problems, I wouldve said youre crazy Now lets push this giant ball of oil out the window."
S09E02,GEORGE,"So, check out my view."
S09E02,JERRY,"Wow! Hey, theres Clare. I better go down."
S09E02,GEORGE,"Hey, theres Kramer & Darren."
S09E02,JERRY,Theres the giant ball of oil. Clares right underneath that thing. Clare! Hello-o-o-o! Hello-o-o-o! Hello-o-o-o!
S09E02,CLARE,I dont believe this. I am not looking up if youre going to do that voice.
S09E02,KRAMER,Bombs away (Uh oh).
S09E02,JERRY,This is going to be a shame.
S09E02,GEORGE,Hello.
S09E02,KRAMER,"Well, that didnt work. Hey, how about thisketchup and mustard in the same bottle?"
S09E02,DARREN,Oh that sounds interesting sir.
S09E02,KRAMER,Yeah.
S09E02,[Scene,At Monks Caf]
S09E02,JERRY,"Clare won her lawsuit against Play Now. Gee, Play Now is filing for bankruptcy. I guess youre not going in anymore."
S09E02,GEORGE,Yeah.
S09E02,JERRY,So theyre not paying you your
S09E02,GEORGE,No.
S09E02,JERRY,So youre pretty much
S09E02,GEORGE,Yeah.
S09E02,JERRY,What ever happened to Darren?
S09E02,KRAMER,Darren is going away for a long long time.
S09E02,JERRY,So Clare sure looked real funny covered in oil like that (doing the voice) Hello-o-o-o I got beamed with a giant ball of oil
S09E02,GEORGE,(doing the voice) Im slippery as an eel
S09E02,KRAMER,(doing the voice) La la la.
S09E02,JERRY,Im just so glad its back.
S09E02,(Scene,At Elaines apartment in bed with Puddy AGAIN)
S09E02,ELAINE,"See, this is good. This is the way it should be. You know why are we fooling ourselves. We belong together."
S09E02,PUDDY,ELAINE I want to break up.
S09E02,ELAINE,Ah nuts!
S09E03,FRANK,I got no leg room back here. Move your seat forward.
S09E03,ESTELLE,That's as far as it goes.
S09E03,FRANK,"There's a mechanism. You just pull it, and throw your body weight."
S09E03,ESTELLE,I pulled it. It doesn't go.
S09E03,FRANK,"If you want the leg room, say you want the leg room! Don't blame the mechanism!"
S09E03,GEORGE,"All right, Dad, we're five blocks from the house. Sit sideways."
S09E03,FRANK,"Like an animal. Because of her, I have to sit here like an animal! Serenity now! Serenity now!"
S09E03,GEORGE,What is that?
S09E03,FRANK,"Doctor gave me a relaxation cassette. When my blood pressure gets too high, the man on the tape tells me to say, 'Serenity now!'"
S09E03,GEORGE,Are you supposed to yell it?
S09E03,FRANK,The man on the tape wasn't specific.
S09E03,GEORGE,What happened to the screen door? It blew off again?
S09E03,ESTELLE,I told you to fix that thing.
S09E03,FRANK,Serenity nowww!
S09E03,PATTY,So I told Bobby and Lisa that we'd try the new Chinese Spanish
S09E03,JERRY,"Oh, I thought we had tickets for the Knicks home opener."
S09E03,PATTY,Well I thought this would be more fun so I gave the tickets away.
S09E03,JERRY,"What? All right, fine."
S09E03,PATTY,Are you mad at me?
S09E03,JERRY,"No, I love a good Chinese Spanish whatever it is."
S09E03,PATTY,You know... I've never seen you mad.
S09E03,JERRY,I get peeved.
S09E03,PATTY,Mad.
S09E03,JERRY,Miffed.
S09E03,PATTY,*Mad*.
S09E03,JERRY,Irked?
S09E03,PATTY,I'd like to see you get *really* mad.
S09E03,GEORGE,Why does she want you to be mad?
S09E03,JERRY,She says I suppress my emotions.
S09E03,GEORGE,So what do you care what she thinks.
S09E03,JERRY,Good body.
S09E03,GEORGE,She probably gets that impression because you're cool. You're under control. Like me. Nothing wrong with that.
S09E03,JERRY,"But I get upset, I've yelled. You've heard me yell."
S09E03,GEORGE,Not really. Your voice kind of raises to this comedic pitch. (Kramer enters)
S09E03,KRAMER,Hey.
S09E03,JERRY,"Kramer, I am so sick of you comin' in here and eatin' all my food. Now shut that door and get the hell out of here!"
S09E03,KRAMER,"(Laughing) What is that, a new bit?"
S09E03,GEORGE,"I told ya. Hey, any of you guys want to come out and help me fix my father's screen door in Queens?"
S09E03,JERRY,"Sorry, I'm fixing a screen door in the Bronx."
S09E03,KRAMER,I'll do it.
S09E03,GEORGE,Really? You wanna come?
S09E03,KRAMER,"Yeah, I love going to the country."
S09E03,ELAINE,Where are they goin'?
S09E03,JERRY,Fix a screen door in Queens.
S09E03,ELAINE,"(Laughing) That's funny. Hey, listen, what are you doin' Saturday night?"
S09E03,JERRY,Not goin' to the Knick game.
S09E03,ELAINE,I need someone to go with me to Mr. Lippman's son's Bar Mitzvah.
S09E03,JERRY,"You know, if you don't bring a guest they save a catering. You should be able to buy a cheaper gift."
S09E03,ELAINE,"(Taking out Boggle) Oh, I don't think that's possible."
S09E03,KRAMER,(Holding camera) Get in a little closer. I can't see the screen door. (Takes picture) Perfect.
S09E03,GEORGE,"Dad, the hinges are all rusted here. That's why the wind keeps blowing the door off."
S09E03,ESTELLE,I hate that old door. Throw it out!
S09E03,FRANK,Serenity now!
S09E03,KRAMER,"It might be time to just let her go, Frank. She's worked hard for ya."
S09E03,FRANK,Will you put her to rest for me?
S09E03,KRAMER,"Oh yeah, I'll take good care of her. (Rips out the screen door)"
S09E03,ESTELLE,(From other room) Get George to put those boxes in the garage.
S09E03,GEORGE,"Dad, what's all this?"
S09E03,ESTELLE,(From other room) It's junk.
S09E03,FRANK,My computers. I've been selling them for two months now. Shut up!
S09E03,GEORGE,You're selling computers?
S09E03,FRANK,"Two months ago, I saw a provocative movie on cable TV. It was called The Net, with that girl from the bus. I did a little reading, and I realize, it wasn't that farfetched."
S09E03,GEORGE,"Dad, you know what it takes to compete with Microsoft and IBM?"
S09E03,FRANK,"Yes, I do. That's why I got a secret weapon... my son."
S09E03,JERRY,"Damn it, they gave me cream! I asked for nonfat milk!"
S09E03,PATTY,I think they have 1% over there.
S09E03,JERRY,1%?! They can kiss 1% of my ass!
S09E03,PATTY,"OK, Jerry, enough. I'm not buying it."
S09E03,JERRY,You're damn right you're not buying it!
S09E03,PATTY,You shouldn't have to try. It's just being open.
S09E03,JERRY,I'm open. There's just nothing in there.
S09E03,PATTY,Sarcastically) Uh huh.
S09E03,JERRY,"Oh, you think I'm lying about this?"
S09E03,PATTY,I think you are.
S09E03,JERRY,"Well, I'm not."
S09E03,PATTY,"Yes, you are, liar."
S09E03,JERRY,"Oh, stop it."
S09E03,PATTY,"OK, liar."
S09E03,JERRY,That's enough!
S09E03,PATTY,"Ooh, that was good."
S09E03,JERRY,Really? It felt good.
S09E03,ELAINE,"Congratulations, Mr. Lippman."
S09E03,LIPPMAN,"Oh, Elaine. My boy's a man today. Can you believe it? He's a man."
S09E03,ELAINE,"Oh, congratulations, Adam. (Adam zealously French-kisses Elaine)"
S09E03,ADAM,I'm a man!
S09E03,JERRY,Tongue?
S09E03,ELAINE,Yeah.
S09E03,GEORGE,Wow! I didn't try that 'til I was 23.
S09E03,JERRY,Well this kid's not just a man. He's a man's man.
S09E03,ELAINE,And I think he's been telling his friends. I got invitations to six more Bar Mitzvahs. (phone rings)
S09E03,JERRY,"Hello? Yeah, this is Jerry Seinfeld. No, no, no, I do not want to stop over in Cincinnati. Well, then you upgrade me. That's right, you should thank me. Goodbye. (Hangs up) Hey, I'm flyin' first class."
S09E03,ELAINE,Where did that come from?
S09E03,JERRY,Patty showed me how to get mad. You gotta problem with that?
S09E03,ELAINE,No.
S09E03,JERRY,Good.
S09E03,GEORGE,"All right, relax, tough guy. I got to go out to my father's garage, help him sell some computers."
S09E03,JERRY,What? The two of you workin' in that garage is like a steel cage death match.
S09E03,GEORGE,Kramer.
S09E03,KRAMER,Yeah.
S09E03,GEORGE,What-what are you doing?
S09E03,KRAMER,"Oh, I'm putting up Frank's screen door. This beauty's got a little life in her yet."
S09E03,JERRY,What do you need it for?
S09E03,KRAMER,"(Closing door) The cool evening breezes of Anytown, USA. Let's see how this baby closes. Oh yeah, yeah, yeah."
S09E03,GEORGE,"Morning, ma."
S09E03,ESTELLE,(From another room ) You're late!
S09E03,GEORGE,"Morning, dad."
S09E03,FRANK,"I'm not 'dad' in the workplace. My professional name is Mr. Costanza, and I will refer to you as 'Costanza'. Morning, Braun."
S09E03,LLOYD,"(Handing Frank coffee) Morning, George. Two cream, no sugar."
S09E03,GEORGE,What is Lloyd Braun doing here?
S09E03,FRANK,Your mother recommended him.
S09E03,GEORGE,"Yeah, of course she did. That's all I ever heard growing up is 'Why can't you be more like Lloyd Braun?' Did you know he was in a mental institution?"
S09E03,FRANK,I didn't read his resume.
S09E03,LLOYD,"(Ringing the sale bell) Another sale, Mr. Costanza. Chalk me up on the big board."
S09E03,GEORGE,(Inquiring about the chalk board) What is this?
S09E03,FRANK,"(Drawing a zero under George's name) This is your lagging. Good work, Braun."
S09E03,ESTELLE,"(From another room) Good for you, Lloyd!"
S09E03,ELAINE,"So Adam, I just talked to your father, and, apology accepted."
S09E03,ADAM,I'm not apologizing. It was great. I told everyone.
S09E03,ELAINE,"Yeah, I know. Uh, by the way, could you do me a favor and tell Mitchell Tanenbaum that I will be unable to attend this Saturday."
S09E03,ADAM,Are you free Friday night?
S09E03,ELAINE,"I am, but that is not the point. You are thirteen, and I am in my early... 20s."
S09E03,ADAM,But I'm a man. The rabbi said so.
S09E03,ELAINE,"No. You are not a man. It takes a *long* time to become a man. I mean, half my friends aren't even there yet."
S09E03,ADAM,"Well, if I'm not a man, then this whole thing was a sham! First, they said I was gonna get great gifts, and then, somebody gives me Boggle. I renounce my religion!"
S09E03,LIPPMAN,Who wants cookies?
S09E03,ADAM,"As of this moment, I am no longer Jewish. I quit!"
S09E03,LIPPMAN,What?
S09E03,ELAINE,"(Eating) Walnuts, mmmmmm."
S09E03,FRANK,"You're late again, Costanza, so listen up. Starting tonight, we're having a little sales contest. The loser gets fired, the winner gets a Waterpik."
S09E03,ESTELLE,(From another room) You're not giving away our Waterpik!
S09E03,FRANK,Serenity now!
S09E03,GEORGE,"You know what? It doesn't matter, because I quit!"
S09E03,FRANK,I guess your mother was right. You never could compete with Lloyd Braun! (Lloyd rings his sale bell and smiles)
S09E03,GEORGE,"You wanna sell computers? I will show *you* how to sell computers! Hello, Mr. Farneman. You wanna buy a computer? No? Why not? All right, I see! Good answer! Thank you! (Lloyd rings his sale bell) Serenity now!"
S09E03,ELAINE,"Adam, you don't become a man overnight. Look at your father. It takes time. Patience, experience. Uh, several careers of varying success. And these are things I look for in a man."
S09E03,ADAM,"(Storming out of the room) Well, that does me a lot of good. 'Early 20s'!"
S09E03,ELAINE,"Well, I'm sorry, sir, I tried."
S09E03,LIPPMAN,"So, that's the type of guy you're looking for?"
S09E03,ELAINE,Uhh. I guess so. Why? (Mr. Lippman vigorously starts making out with her)
S09E03,PATTY,(Surveying Kramer's hall patio ) What is this?
S09E03,JERRY,"(Knocking on Kramer's door) Anytown, U.S.A. Hello? Is Kramer home? Oh, hey."
S09E03,KRAMER,"(Spraying his flowers) Hello, neighbor."
S09E03,JERRY,"Boy, those azaleas are really coming in nicely."
S09E03,KRAMER,"Oh, you gotta mulch. You've got to."
S09E03,JERRY,You barbecuing tonight?
S09E03,KRAMER,(Ringing his wind chimes) Right after the fireworks.
S09E03,JERRY,"So, where do you want to eat tonight?"
S09E03,PATTY,How about La Caridad again?
S09E03,JERRY,Again!? How much flan can a person eat!?
S09E03,PATTY,"Jerry, you've been yelling at me all afternoon."
S09E03,JERRY,"Well, I don't think more flan is the answer!"
S09E03,PATTY,Maybe I should just leave.
S09E03,JERRY,'Maybe'!?
S09E03,PATTY,Good-bye!
S09E03,JERRY,"Double good-bye! (As Patty leaves, open door reveals Kramer, sitting on his lawn chair with a sparkler)"
S09E03,KRAMER,"Hey, buddy!"
S09E03,ELAINE,(Coming in Jerry's apartment) Hey. Happy New Year!
S09E03,KRAMER,(Getting the door slammed on him) Y'all come back reeeaall...
S09E03,ELAINE,Did you and Patty just break up?
S09E03,JERRY,"Yeah! In fact, she broke up with me! And I don't want to talk about it!"
S09E03,ELAINE,"Well, then you're free tonight. You know what, I heard about this great place called La Caridad."
S09E03,JERRY,"That's the last thing she said to me. She wanted to go there also, but I wasn't in the mood."
S09E03,ELAINE,Whoa. What is the matter?
S09E03,JERRY,It's Patty.
S09E03,ELAINE,"Jerry, you break up with a girl every week."
S09E03,JERRY,(Crying) What--what is this salty discharge?
S09E03,ELAINE,Oh my God. You're crying.
S09E03,JERRY,This is horrible! I care!
S09E03,JERRY,Patty won't call me back. I don't know if I can live without her.
S09E03,KRAMER,"She's really gotten to you, hasn't she?"
S09E03,JERRY,I don't know what's happening to me.
S09E03,KRAMER,"Simple. You let out one emotion, all the rest will come with it. It's like Endora's box."
S09E03,JERRY,That was the mother on Bewitched. You mean Pandora.
S09E03,KRAMER,"Yeah, well, she... had one, too. (George enters)"
S09E03,GEORGE,"Jerry, can I talk to you for a second? (They enter Jerry's apartment)"
S09E03,KRAMER,"(Baseball flies at Kramer and hits him) That's it, that's it! I warned you kids. I told you not to play in front of my house. This time, I'm keepin' it. And you're not getting back your rock either!"
S09E03,GEORGE,(hearing Jerry broke up with Patty) Are you still down in the dumps? Come on. It's just a chick.
S09E03,JERRY,You ever heard of a little thing called feelings?
S09E03,GEORGE,"Well, I got just the thing to cheer you up. A computer! Huh? We can check porn, and stock quotes."
S09E03,JERRY,"Porn quotes... I'm so lucky to have a friend like you, George. Ever tell you how much I love you?"
S09E03,GEORGE,What?
S09E03,JERRY,"I love you, George. Come here."
S09E03,GEORGE,"I-I'm already here. I'm here. I'm here. Uh, you know what? If you want a computer, call me. I-I gotta go."
S09E03,JERRY,Go wherever you want. I'm still gonna love you.
S09E03,KRAMER,"Look what they did. Look what they did to my house! I turn my back for two seconds, and they put shaving cream all over my door. You, I see you! I'll teach these kids a lesson. Where's that house I put under your sink?"
S09E03,JERRY,"Hose under my sink. I love *you*, Kramer!"
S09E03,KRAMER,"I love you, too, buddy, and George--"
S09E03,GEORGE,"I don't want to hear it, Kramer!"
S09E03,KRAMER,"Listen, when I give you the signal, I want you to turn this water on full blast."
S09E03,GEORGE,What signal? What-what signal?
S09E03,KRAMER,"I'll yell, uh, 'Hoochie mama!'"
S09E03,GEORGE,"If I do it, will you buy a computer?"
S09E03,KRAMER,"On the signal, George. On the signal."
S09E03,GEORGE,Only if you buy. I gotta make a sale.
S09E03,JERRY,"I love you, Costanza."
S09E03,GEORGE,Will you shut up?!
S09E03,KRAMER,"Now! Now, George! Turn on the faucet! George, turn on the faucet! Hoochie mama! Hoochie mama! Hoochie mamamaaaaa!"
S09E03,ELAINE,So now the *other* Lippman kissed me.
S09E03,GEORGE,"Well, sure. They're Jewish, and you're a shiksa."
S09E03,ELAINE,What?
S09E03,GEORGE,It means a non-Jewish woman.
S09E03,ELAINE,"I know what it means, but what does being a shiksa have to do with it?"
S09E03,GEORGE,You've got 'shiksappeal'. Jewish men love the idea of meeting a woman that's not like their mother.
S09E03,ELAINE,"Oh, that's insane."
S09E03,GEORGE,I'll tell you what's insane the price that I could get you on a new desktop computer.
S09E03,ELAINE,I am not buying a computer from you.
S09E03,GEORGE,There's porn.
S09E03,ELAINE,(Pausing) Even so.
S09E03,GEORGE,Damn it!
S09E03,ELAINE,"Don't get me wrong, Mr. Lippman. I-I'm very flattered that you found me attractive enough to... lunge at me. Huh. But the only reason you like me is because I'm a shiksa."
S09E03,LIPPMAN,That's simply not true.
S09E03,ELAINE,"If you weren't Jewish, you wouldn't be interested in me."
S09E03,LIPPMAN,You are wrong. I'll prove it.
S09E03,ELAINE,"Oh, no. Don't!"
S09E03,LIPPMAN,I renounce Judaism!
S09E03,ELAINE,Oy vey!
S09E03,JERRY,"What happened to you, pal?"
S09E03,KRAMER,Joey Zanfino and some of the neighborhood kids. They ambushed me with a box of 'Grade A's.
S09E03,JERRY,Are you all right?
S09E03,KRAMER,"Oh, no. I'm fine. Serenity now. Serenity now. Serenity now."
S09E03,JERRY,"So, you're using Frank's relaxation method?"
S09E03,KRAMER,"(Trying to open a back of chips) Jerry, the anger, it just melts right off. Serenity now. Look at this. Serenity now!"
S09E03,ELAINE,"(Enters) Hey, what happened to you?"
S09E03,KRAMER,Serenity! (He exits)
S09E03,ELAINE,Well. You are not gonna believe this. Now Lippman is renounced. This shiksa thing is *totally* out of control. What is *with* you people? What are you looking at?
S09E03,JERRY,"Sit down, Elaine."
S09E03,ELAINE,"Oh, no. Jerry, I can't take any more gentle sobbing."
S09E03,JERRY,I've been thinking about what it means to be complete.
S09E03,ELAINE,Do you have an apple or anything?
S09E03,JERRY,"Look at us, hurtling through space on this big, blue marble."
S09E03,ELAINE,Or a nectarine? I would absolutely love a nectarine.
S09E03,JERRY,Looking everywhere for some kind of meaning...
S09E03,ELAINE,"Why am I in such a fruit mood? Ahh, banana!"
S09E03,JERRY,"When all the while, the real secret to happiness has been right in front of us!"
S09E03,ELAINE,What?
S09E03,JERRY,Elaine...
S09E03,GEORGE,"(Entering Jerry's apartment with a cartload of computers) Jerry, I've found a way to beat Lloyd Braun! I buy the computers myself, I store 'em in your apartment. Then, after I win the contest, I bring 'em all back and get my money back. Ha ha! It's brilliant. What? What's wrong with your leg?"
S09E03,JERRY,I'm asking Elaine to marry me.
S09E03,GEORGE,(Leaving) I'll store these over at Kramer's apartment.
S09E03,JERRY,Elaine?
S09E03,ELAINE,"Uhh, Jerry, I've got a lot goin' on with, uh, Lippman right now."
S09E03,JERRY,Lippman?
S09E03,ELAINE,"(Trying to get her bag to leave) Yeah, and him too. What?! Oh, yeah! I think George is calling me, so I'm gonna go give him a hand. Come on! Come on!"
S09E03,JERRY,Can I help you?
S09E03,ELAINE,No. Stay! Stay. Stay.
S09E03,FRANK,"Hey, Braun, Costanza's kicking your butt!"
S09E03,GEORGE,"(using the phone) Watch how it's done. Oh, hello, Mr. Vandelay? Would you like to buy a computer? Oh, really? Two dozen?"
S09E03,FRANK,"Costanza, you're white hot!"
S09E03,PHONE,"If you'd like to make a call, please hang up and--"
S09E03,FRANK,"Hey, Braun, I got good news and bad news. And they're both the same you're fired. Costanza, you've won the water pik!"
S09E03,ESTELLE,You're not gonna give away that water pik!
S09E03,FRANK,"You wanna bet? Serenity now, serenity now!"
S09E03,LLOYD,"You know, you should tell your dad that 'serenity now' thing doesn't work. It just bottles up the anger, and eventually, you blow."
S09E03,GEORGE,What do you know? You were in the nut house.
S09E03,LLOYD,What do you think put me there?
S09E03,GEORGE,I heard they found a family in your freezer
S09E03,LLOYD,Serenity now. Insanity later.
S09E03,JERRY,"What happened here, Kramer?"
S09E03,KRAMER,"Serenity now, serenity now..."
S09E03,JERRY,Kramer!
S09E03,KRAMER,"Geez! Jerry, I didn't here you come in. Yeah, the children, they've done sum redecorating. Serenity now, serenity now."
S09E03,JERRY,You don't look well.
S09E03,KRAMER,"Well, that's odd, 'cause I feel perfectly at peace with the world- uh! eggs! you! Serenity now, serenity now, serenity now."
S09E03,JERRY,"Oh, I'm sorry. Look at me, I stepped on your last rose."
S09E03,KRAMER,"(going into his apartment) Jerry, come on. Don't get upset about it. There's always next spring. Now will you excuse me for a moment. Serenity nooooooooww!"
S09E03,GEORGE,Jerry! I did it! Haha! I beat Braun!
S09E03,KRAMER,(crashing and banging in his apartment) Serenity now!
S09E03,GEORGE,"Come on, wanna give me a hand with the computers?"
S09E03,KRAMER,(Crashing and banging around) Serenity nooooowwwww!
S09E03,GEORGE,Why couldn't you squeeze one of those stupid rubber balls to get your stress out? Why did you have to destroy *twenty-five* computers?
S09E03,KRAMER,"(Leaving) George, you listen to me. I owe ya one."
S09E03,JERRY,He's incorrigible. You want to talk about it?
S09E03,GEORGE,"Oh, please don't tell me you love me again, Jerry, I can't handle it."
S09E03,JERRY,"George, letting my emotions out was the best thing I've ever done. Sure I'm not funny anymore, but there's more to life than making shallow, fairly-obvious observations. How about you?"
S09E03,GEORGE,All right... here goes...
S09E03,ELAINE,"Rabbi, is there anything I can do to combat this Shiks-appeal?"
S09E03,RABBI,"Ha! Elaine, shiks-appeal is a myth, like the Yeti, or his North American cousin, the Sasquatch."
S09E03,ELAINE,"Well, something's goin' on here, 'cause every able-bodied Israelite in the county is driving pretty strong to the hoop."
S09E03,RABBI,"Elaine, there's much you don't understand about the Jewish religion. For example, did you know that rabbis are allowed to date?"
S09E03,ELAINE,"(About to leave) Well, what does that have to do...?"
S09E03,RABBI,"You know, a member of my congregation has a timeshare in Myrtle Beach. Perhaps, if you're not too busy, we could wing on down after the High Holidays? Elaine? 'Lainie?"
S09E03,GEORGE,"So, that's it. All of my darkest fears, and... everything I'm capable of. That's me."
S09E03,JERRY,"Yikes. Well, good look with all that."
S09E03,GEORGE,Where you going? I-I thought I could count on you for a little compassion.
S09E03,JERRY,I think you scared me straight.
S09E03,ELAINE,"All right, Jerome, I'm in."
S09E03,JERRY,What?
S09E03,ELAINE,Maybe we should get married. Maybe everything we need is right here in front of us. Jer... let's do it.
S09E03,JERRY,"I tell ya, I don't see it happening."
S09E03,ELAINE,What? What happened to the new Jerry?
S09E03,JERRY,He doesn't work here anymore.
S09E03,ELAINE,"Oh, well that's just *great!*"
S09E03,GEORGE,"I love you, Jerry."
S09E03,JERRY,"(Leaving) Right back at ya, Slick."
S09E03,GEORGE,"You know, all these years, I've always wanted to see the two of you get back together."
S09E03,ELAINE,"Well, that's because you're an idiot."
S09E03,FRANK,You single-handedly brought Costanza and Son to the brink of bankruptcy.
S09E03,GEORGE,Well what about all the Lloyd Braun sales?
S09E03,FRANK,He's crazy. His phone wasn't even hooked up. He just liked ringing that bell.
S09E03,ESTELLE,I told you to clean out this garage. I have to put my car in!
S09E03,FRANK,This is a place of business. I told you never to come in here. Serenity now!
S09E03,ESTELLE,All right...
S09E03,GEORGE,"Dad, you really should lay off the 'serenity now' stuff."
S09E03,FRANK,"So, what am I supposed to say?"
S09E03,GEORGE,'Hoochie mama'?
S09E03,ESTELLE,"Move your crap, I'm comin' in!"
S09E03,FRANK,No you're not! Hoochie mama! Hoochie mama!
S09E04,JERRY,Are you sure you can't stay longer?
S09E04,MORTY,"No, we just came for the funeral. `"
S09E04,HELEN,"Poor Marvin Kessler, he went too early."
S09E04,JERRY,He was 96 years old.
S09E04,MORTY,"That had nothing to do with it, the man was out of shape."
S09E04,HELEN,That's why we joined a program. We walk once around the block three times a week.
S09E04,MORTY,And every morning I eat a plum.
S09E04,JERRY,"Well, what ever you do, you're wearing me out."
S09E04,HELEN,What about you?
S09E04,MORTY,"Yeah, looks like you're getting a little spare tire there, tiger."
S09E04,JERRY,Really?
S09E04,KRAMER,"Hey, Seinfelds!"
S09E04,MORTY,"Hey, Mr. Kramer!"
S09E04,KRAMER,How long are you staying?
S09E04,HELEN,We just came down for a funeral.
S09E04,KRAMER,"Oh yeah, yeah I heard, Marvin Kessler. Boy, that makes you think. If he could go..."
S09E04,HELEN,See you downstairs with the car.
S09E04,JERRY,Are you sure you don't need a hand with that?
S09E04,MORTY,"No no, the luggage is on the program. I got a brick in here."
S09E04,JERRY,Did you give blood?
S09E04,KRAMER,"No, not giving. hoarding. I'm storing it in to a blood bank. Just in case."
S09E04,JERRY,In case of what?
S09E04,KRAMER,"Jerry, I know myself. If I'm out on the street and it's starts to go down, I don't back off until it's finished."
S09E04,JERRY,Are we finished?
S09E04,KRAMER,Done.
S09E04,VIVIAN,"Elaine, I'm so glad you came out."
S09E04,ELAINE,Yeah...
S09E04,VIVIAN,You haven't seen Jimmy for years.
S09E04,ELAINE,"I know, I'm glad I got to see him before he hit puberty and got, you know all lurchy and awkward."
S09E04,VIVIAN,"Actually, I'm gonna need someone to look after him tomorrow evening."
S09E04,ELAINE,"Tomorrow evening, sure."
S09E04,VIVIAN,Do you know anyone responsible?
S09E04,ELAINE,Do I know anyone??
S09E04,VIVIAN,"Well, if you think of anybody, give me a call."
S09E04,GEORGE,What are you doing?
S09E04,TARA,"Incense, for the mood."
S09E04,GEORGE,"Oh yes, by no means, the mood. Let me know if there's anything I can do to lend support to the mood."
S09E04,GEORGE,"Um, cream soda?"
S09E04,TARA,Vanilla.
S09E04,ELAINE,"Can you believe that, Vivian doesn't think I'm responsible?"
S09E04,JERRY,"Who wants to responsible? When ever anything goes wrong, the first thing they ask is who's responsible for this?"
S09E04,ELAINE,"I couldn't raise a kid? Come on, I love bossing people around."
S09E04,JERRY,"What happened, I thought you were with Tara tonight?"
S09E04,GEORGE,"I was, I had to leave. She lit some vanilla incenses. The smell drove me nuts, all I could think about was food, I had to get out of there. We need some pudding here! Pudding!"
S09E04,ELAINE,You just left? What did you tell her?
S09E04,GEORGE,I told I had a bus transfer that was only good just for another hour.
S09E04,JERRY,What?
S09E04,GEORGE,"I don't know, I was starving Jerry!"
S09E04,GEORGE,"Oh, pudding! You want some?"
S09E04,JERRY,"Hey, you guys think I'm getting a little...chunky?"
S09E04,GEORGE,"What are you kidding? We look great! You know what this pudding needs? The skin on the top, you know like your mother used to make it on the stove."
S09E04,JERRY,"Elaine, what do you think?"
S09E04,ELAINE,I think you're getting a little pudding under the skin yourself.
S09E04,KRAMER,"My service rates went up? You banks are all the same with your hidden fees and your service charges. Well, maybe I'll just take my blood elsewhere, yeah."
S09E04,BANK EMPLOYEE,"Well, we can transfer to another bank for you."
S09E04,KRAMER,"Oh, no no no...no more banks. I'm keeping my blood in my freezer with...my money!"
S09E04,GEORGE,"So eh, what do you say?"
S09E04,TARA,I guess we could use some food in our lovemaking.
S09E04,GEORGE,"Ok, we got your...got your strawberries, your chocolate sauce, your pastrami on rye with mustard, your honey..."
S09E04,TARA,"Wait wait wait, pastrami on rye with mustard?"
S09E04,GEORGE,"Oh yeah yeah, don't you know they used pastrami in that movie 9? weeks? Remember the pastrami scene?"
S09E04,TARA,No.
S09E04,GEORGE,"Well, maybe it was Ghostbusters? Where ever it was, it worked!"
S09E04,JERRY,"Didn't go for it, huh?"
S09E04,GEORGE,No.
S09E04,JERRY,"So, she didn't appreciate the erotic qualities of the salted cured meats?"
S09E04,GEORGE,"She tolerated the strawberries and the chocolate sauce, but eh, it's not a meal, you know? Food and sex, those are my two passions. It's only natural to combine them."
S09E04,JERRY,"Natural? Sex is about love between a man and a woman, not a man and a sandwich."
S09E04,GEORGE,"Jerry, I'm not suggesting getting rid of the girl. She's integral."
S09E04,JERRY,"Maybe instead of trying to satisfy two of your needs, how about satisfying one of somebody else's."
S09E04,GEORGE,"Hey, speaking of which, I found a great way to separate the skin from the top of the pudding without leaving any around the edges; Exacto knife."
S09E04,JERRY,"I told you George, no more pudding. I'm starting a purification program. Keep all that kind of food away from me."
S09E04,GEORGE,"Well, I guess these would be out of the question. (pulls out two pudding skins in plastic bags.)"
S09E04,JERRY,What the hell is that?
S09E04,GEORGE,Pudding skin singles.
S09E04,KRAMER,"Hey buddy, I'm borrowing all your Tupperware."
S09E04,JERRY,"Oh, why?"
S09E04,KRAMER,I closed down my account at the blood bank.
S09E04,JERRY,"What, it...it's here in the building?"
S09E04,KRAMER,"Right across the hall. What, you wanna go see?"
S09E04,JERRY,"No I don't! In fact, if even one corpuscles of that blood should find it's way across that hall I will freak out on you Kramer! Freak out."
S09E04,KRAMER,"You know, for a fat guy you're not very jolly."
S09E04,ELAINE,"Hey, working out?"
S09E04,JERRY,You know it and I ditched all my junk food.
S09E04,KRAMER,What the heck is going on here?
S09E04,JERRY,"Sorry buddy, clean house. It's all health food."
S09E04,KRAMER,"Well, I may have to take it, but I don't have to like it."
S09E04,ELAINE,Vivian left me a message. I guess a certain someone changed her mind about whether someone was responsible enough to watch certain other someone.
S09E04,JERRY,Is this about me?
S09E04,ELAINE,No.
S09E04,JERRY,"Oh, then I lost interest."
S09E04,ELAINE,"Vivian, hi it's Elaine. Yeah, I'm over at Jerry's, I got your message...What? Yeah, he's right here, hold on...(hands the phone to Kramer.)"
S09E04,KRAMER,"For me? Go...Yeah, what tonight? Yeah, I'll be there...Yeah later. (puts the phone down) Well, somebody's baby-sitting."
S09E04,ELAINE,You? I'm more responsible than you are!
S09E04,KRAMER,"Don't be ridiculous. Now, if you'll excuse me, I have to go to fill my freezer with my own blood."
S09E04,GEORGE,"Oh, Tara!"
S09E04,KRAMER,"Hello, Vivian! Oh, this is a nice screen."
S09E04,ELAINE,Kramer...
S09E04,KRAMER,Don't take my money!
S09E04,ELAINE,"It is me, you idiot. Hi, all right you've got to get out of here, I'm gonna baby-sit the hell out of that kid."
S09E04,KRAMER,"No, I'm the baby-sitter."
S09E04,ELAINE,"No no no, you're out, I'm in. Now, hit the road."
S09E04,VIVIAN,Elaine? What are you doing here?
S09E04,ELAINE,"Kramer is actually sleeping one off, so I thought that I'd help out...(Kramer moans from the bushes) what's that, some raccoon or something...(hits Kramer with a broom.)"
S09E04,VIVIAN,"Well, I guess this would be all right. Jimmy, you remember Elaine? She's gonna watch you tonight."
S09E04,ELAINE,Hi Jimmy. (Jimmy kicks Elaine to the shin.) Ouch! (The screen door hits her in the head.)
S09E04,JERRY,"Hey, what are you doing here? I thought you were baby-sitting at Vivian's."
S09E04,KRAMER,There was an incident.
S09E04,JERRY,"Oh no, where's the blood? (opens the fridge) It's in here isn't it?"
S09E04,KRAMER,Would you stop it.
S09E04,JERRY,What is this?
S09E04,KRAMER,It's Jell-O.
S09E04,JERRY,What about this? This is blood isn't it?!
S09E04,KRAMER,"This is tomato juice, look...(drinks from the bottle.)"
S09E04,JERRY,"Ooh, you're sick! You're sick!!"
S09E04,KRAMER,Will you calm down. I took all my blood down to Newman's. He let me put it in his meat freezer.
S09E04,JERRY,"Hey, what's going on? Who made pudding?"
S09E04,KRAMER,"Oh yeah yeah, George he came by and made more of those pudding skin singles. They're delicious."
S09E04,JERRY,"Damn that George, I told him I don't want this stuff around here anymore..."
S09E04,KRAMER,Heads up!
S09E04,JERRY,Aaah...
S09E04,JIMMY,"You're dead, president Lincoln! You're dead!"
S09E04,ELAINE,I wish I was dead.
S09E04,JIMMY,Can I have your juice?
S09E04,ELAINE,As long as you don't put...
S09E04,ELAINE,Thanks for the re-fill.
S09E04,VIVIAN,"Hey, Elaine! How did it go?"
S09E04,ELAINE,"Oh, he's...he's a joy..."
S09E04,VIVIAN,Really? Some sitter have told me he's bit of a handful.
S09E04,ELAINE,"Oh, handful of sunshine. I wish I could do this every day."
S09E04,VIVIAN,"Oh Elaine, that's so good to hear. I've been having a few health problems lately."
S09E04,ELAINE,"It's not serious, is it?"
S09E04,VIVIAN,"Well, it might be. Just in case anything does happen, it's nice to know there's somebody like you around."
S09E04,ELAINE,"Oh yeah, that eh...that is nice to know. (Pours the juice from the bag back to glass.)"
S09E04,JERRY,Aah!
S09E04,KRAMER,"It's ok, Jerry. I'm right here."
S09E04,JERRY,I can see that! What happened?
S09E04,KRAMER,"That knife, it nicked your jugular. You know Jerry, when somebody yells 'heads up', you're not supposed to actually look up."
S09E04,JERRY,I'll remember that.
S09E04,KRAMER,"Anyway, you were lucky that I was there. You lost a lot of blood."
S09E04,JERRY,What?
S09E04,KRAMER,"Oh yeah, you've got three pints of Kramer in you, buddy."
S09E04,GEORGE,Three pints of Kramer's blood?
S09E04,JERRY,I can feel his blood inside of me. Borrowing things from my blood.
S09E04,GEORGE,"Well, so much for purification week."
S09E04,JERRY,"So, how's the fornicating gourmet?"
S09E04,GEORGE,"Doing quite well, thank you. Yesterday I had a soft boiled egg and a quickie. You know what? If I could add TV to the equation, that would really be the ultimate."
S09E04,JERRY,"George, we're trying to have a civilization here."
S09E04,ELAINE,Hey.
S09E04,JERRY,"Hey, how was baby-sitting?"
S09E04,ELAINE,"Oh, just great. I found out that Vivian has some kind of medical problem and if the worst happens she wants me to take care of Jimmy."
S09E04,JERRY,"Oh, I'm sure it won't be the worst."
S09E04,ELAINE,"It doesn't matter. If anything happens to her, I'm on deck! Scissors mishap, air show disaster, chinese organ thieves...it's a dangerous world."
S09E04,GEORGE,"She's right, I heard Kramer got mugged out on the suburbs on a baby-sitting gig."
S09E04,JERRY,Really?
S09E04,KRAMER,"Look at this, look at the hair on the back of my neck. It's all bramble, see it's like thicket back there. Look, I need somebody to shave it for me, huh?"
S09E04,JERRY,I'm not touching that thing.
S09E04,KRAMER,"Well, I have to say I'm very surprised and disappointed - blood brother."
S09E04,JERRY,"Oh, no..."
S09E04,KRAMER,"What? Jerry, I gave you my blood. Listen to your pulse, (takes Jerry hand) hey buddy-hey buddy-hey buddy..."
S09E04,JERRY,"Kramer, I'm not shaving your neck."
S09E04,KRAMER,"So, my blood is not enough. Would you like a kidney too, because I'll give it to you? I'll rip it out right here and stack it on the table!"
S09E04,JERRY,"All right, all right I'll do it, sit down."
S09E04,KRAMER,"No no no, I don't have time right now. I'll catch you tonight, we'll do sort of an all over kind of thing, all right?"
S09E04,JERRY,Hello?
S09E04,HELEN,"Kramer called, he told that you were in a hospital."
S09E04,JERRY,Kramer called you?
S09E04,HELEN,He calls every week. Are you all right?
S09E04,JERRY,"Yes, I'm fine."
S09E04,HELEN,He says he's fine.
S09E04,MORTY,Tell him to eat a plum.
S09E04,HELEN,"Jerry, you really have to take better care of yourself. We bought you some session with a personal trainer."
S09E04,JERRY,"I don't need a personal trainer. (Kramer comes in) all right I've got to go, we'll talk about this later."
S09E04,MORTY,Plum...(Jerry hangs up.)
S09E04,JERRY,Why are you calling my parents?
S09E04,KRAMER,"Well, maybe if you called more often, I wouldn't have to. Listen, is it all right if I watch a tape in here?"
S09E04,JERRY,Why here?
S09E04,KRAMER,"Well, I'm taping Canadian Parliament, you know on C-Span."
S09E04,JERRY,Ok...
S09E04,KRAMER,"Is it all right if I watch it in your bedroom, cause your bed is really nice?"
S09E04,JERRY,Fine...
S09E04,KRAMER,Ok!
S09E04,JERRY,No no no no no no no no no no! I do not want that in here!
S09E04,KRAMER,Blood!
S09E04,JERRY,All right.
S09E04,IZZY,"Hello, dough boy."
S09E04,JERRY,Mr. Mandelbaum? You're the personal trainer?
S09E04,IZZY,"I'm here to whip you in to shape, so grab your jocks - if you need one. It's go-time."
S09E04,VIVIAN,Elaine? Elaine?
S09E04,ELAINE,"Oh, hi, oh God. I didn't here you come in."
S09E04,VIVIAN,Where's Jimmy?
S09E04,ELAINE,"I don't know, I don't know...we had HoHos for dinner and then eh...and then he put this plastic bag over his head and started running around until he got tired and then he laid down somewhere I...I tell you I'm no good watching that kid."
S09E04,VIVIAN,"Sleeping like an angel. Elaine, you're the best."
S09E04,ELAINE,No! I'm a scatter brain. That's why I probably can't hold a job or keep a man!
S09E04,VIVIAN,"Be quiet. So, will you watch Jimmy tomorrow?"
S09E04,ELAINE,"All right, but I'm running out of purses here. (takes her purse from a punch ball.)"
S09E04,JERRY,"Ok Mr. Mandelbaum, what you want me to do?"
S09E04,IZZY,"Don't get puss honey, and pick up that medicine ball."
S09E04,JERRY,"Is this a gym, or some kind of fitness museum?"
S09E04,IZZY,"Not funny, over your head with it. Are you ready?"
S09E04,JERRY,For what?
S09E04,IZZY,All aboard in the pain train!
S09E04,JERRY,How many session did my parents paid for?
S09E04,IZZY,"Not enough to make a man of you, daffodil."
S09E04,GEORGE,"Oohoho...spicy mustard...woohoho, you're hot tonight!"
S09E04,TARA,"Oh, George!"
S09E04,GEORGE,And now for the trifecta. (Picks up a hand held TV and gets back under the covers.)
S09E04,TARA,George? George? What are you doing?! (Pulls the covers off. George is eating a sandwich and watching TV.)
S09E04,GEORGE,Pleasuring you?
S09E04,[5A. Kramer and Newman are making sausages. Tape recorder plays Jackie Davis,Manana. Jerry comes in.]
S09E04,JERRY,What is this?
S09E04,KRAMER,We're making sausages.
S09E04,JERRY,I thought you were gonna watch a video.
S09E04,KRAMER,"Yeah, an instructional video about how to make your own sausages."
S09E04,JERRY,"Kramer, I'm not in a mood for this."
S09E04,KRAMER,"All right, all right. Newman, let's go grab some mail sacks and haul these beauties out of here."
S09E04,JERRY,"Blood over there, sausages over here. I'm living in a slaughter house."
S09E04,IZZY,Tonight I want you to sleep on this. Toughens the vertebrae. (Looks at the sausages) What in holy hell? Sausages? Is this your diet?
S09E04,JERRY,No they're not mine Mr. Mandelbaum...
S09E04,IZZY,"Don't lie to me, butter bean. We're taking it up a notch."
S09E04,JERRY,"So, the free love buffet is over?"
S09E04,GEORGE,I got greedy. Flew too close to the sun on wings of pastrami.
S09E04,JERRY,"Yeah, that's what you did...I can't believe I got another session with Izzy Mandelbaum, he's probably makes me box a kangaroo."
S09E04,JERRY,What's going on?
S09E04,GEORGE,I don't know. This sandwich is making me flush.
S09E04,JERRY,"Oh no, I'll tell you what you did Caligula; you combined food and sex in to one disgusting uncontrollable urge."
S09E04,GEORGE,I think you're right. You gonna eat that?
S09E04,JERRY,"No, but please tell me that's all you're gonna do with it."
S09E04,ELAINE,"Jerry, I tell you; if this woman dies, it is going to be a major inconvenience."
S09E04,GEORGE,These fries are really really good...
S09E04,JERRY,"All right, that's enough of that. (Jerry takes the plates and hands them to a waitress.)"
S09E04,ELAINE,"I mean I can't shake this woman. You know, now I have to go to Jimmy's birthday party."
S09E04,GEORGE,"Uuh, sleepy."
S09E04,ELAINE,"No matter what I do, I cannot weasel out of raising this kid."
S09E04,JERRY,"Well, sleepy here is quite a weasel, maybe he can bat for you."
S09E04,ELAINE,"Yeah, that's what I need; a pinch weasel."
S09E04,KRAMER,Why did you get rid of that sausage?
S09E04,JERRY,"It wasn't me, it was Mr. Mandelbaum."
S09E04,KRAMER,"Yeah well, Newman's not happy, he booted me out of his freezer. Look, I've got to take my blood back to the bank, can I borrow your car?"
S09E04,JERRY,What's wrong with yours?
S09E04,KRAMER,I got no A/C and I gotta keep the blood cold or it'll go bad.
S09E04,JERRY,"All right, but this is it, this is the last favor, we're even!"
S09E04,KRAMER,"All right, Even Steven. Oh, by the way, when you get back to your apartment try to keep it down because Newman is taking a nap in your bed."
S09E04,KRAMER,"Oh, man...(looks to the glove compartment for a manual.) ""If the engine begins to overheat, turn off air conditioner"". Never, I can't do that."
S09E04,KRAMER,"Oh, mama..."
S09E04,KRAMER,"Shees, come on...(opens the radiator)..this thing is bone dry. (Looks at the blood.)"
S09E04,ELAINE,Vivian...
S09E04,VIVIAN,Elaine!
S09E04,ELAINE,Hi! This is my friend George.
S09E04,VIVIAN,Hi...
S09E04,ELAINE,I'm gonna go say hi to Jimmy.
S09E04,VIVIAN,Ok.
S09E04,ELAINE,(whispering to George) You're up.
S09E04,VIVIAN,"Oh, isn't Elaine fantastic?"
S09E04,GEORGE,Yes she is. It's a pity we won't be seeing much more of her.
S09E04,VIVIAN,"Really, why?"
S09E04,GEORGE,"Oh, you haven't heard, she's going to live with her grandparents in Redding Pennsylvania."
S09E04,VIVIAN,Her grandparent passed away five years ago.
S09E04,GEORGE,Yes they did. I was covering. Elaine has been deported back to Scotland.
S09E04,VIVIAN,"She's American citizen, I have seen her passport."
S09E04,GEORGE,"All right, no more lies. Elaine is been chosen to represent the Upper West Side in the next Biosphere project."
S09E04,VIVIAN,I haven't heard anything about another Biosphere.
S09E04,GEORGE,That's because it's underwater.
S09E04,VIVIAN,This is insane.
S09E04,GEORGE,Is it?
S09E04,VIVIAN,Yes it it.
S09E04,GEORGE,"Well, it's all for charity, so what's the difference."
S09E04,VIVIAN,You...very knowledgeable.
S09E04,GEORGE,"Well, I'm also an architect. Is that pastrami?"
S09E04,VIVIAN,Yes it is. I find the pastrami to be the most sensual of all the salted cured meats. Hungry?
S09E04,GEORGE,Very.
S09E04,VIVIAN,"Oh, wait...(Vivian turns the TV on.) Oohh..."
S09E04,GEORGE,Vivian!!
S09E04,JERRY,Is this really necessary?
S09E04,IZZY,"If you wanna live in a butcher shop, I'm gonna treat you like a piece of meat."
S09E04,JERRY,What if I can't keep up?
S09E04,IZZY,"You lie, you dry. Fire it up, son."
S09E04,IZZY JR.,"Right dad, Mandelbaum, Mandelbaum..."
S09E04,IZZY & IZZY JR.,"Mandelbaum, Mandelbaum...(Izzy Jr. drives ahead, but the car starts jerking)"
S09E04,IZZY,"Move it, move it! Get those knees up! Come on, kick it, kick it!"
S09E04,JERRY,What's going on?
S09E04,IZZY JR.,There's something wrong with your car. It's dripping something on my feet. Some kind of red liquid.
S09E04,JERRY,"Oh my God, the blood!"
S09E04,IZZY JR.,Blood!!
S09E04,IZZY,"Get up boy, get up! We got a problem here! Tough it up. This is for real, you've got to want it..."
S09E04,ELAINE,So how long did they drag you?
S09E04,JERRY,"Well, for the first quarter mile they thought that I was just doggin' it."
S09E04,ELAINE,Hi George. Hi Jimmy.
S09E04,GEORGE,"Yeah, Jimmy why don't you wait outside, you know, play with something."
S09E04,GEORGE,Ouch!
S09E04,JERRY,What's the kid doing here?
S09E04,GEORGE,I'm baby-sitting! Vivian asked me to raise him if she doesn't make it.
S09E04,JERRY,"Oh, that's a drag..."
S09E04,KRAMER,That kid...
S09E04,JERRY,You put blood in the car?!
S09E04,KRAMER,"Jerry, it was overheating. You should take better care of that thing."
S09E04,JERRY,"Well, they told me that I got more blood, so I guess I owe you again."
S09E04,KRAMER,You didn't get the blood from me.
S09E04,JERRY,Then who?
S09E04,NEWMAN,Hello Jerry.
S09E04,JERRY,Aaaaahhh...!!!
S09E04,JERRY & KRAMER,Aaaahhh...!!!
S09E04,"JERRY, KRAMER & NEWMAN",Aaaaahhh...!!!
S09E05,JERRY,(on the phone) Yeah. Yeah. All right. Uh-huh.
S09E05,GEORGE,"(knocking on the counter and feigning a muffled, Chinese voice) Chinese food!"
S09E05,JERRY,"(hanging up the phone) Oh! There's my Chinese food, I gotta run. All you."
S09E05,GEORGE,Who was it?
S09E05,JERRY,I did a show for a car dealership and they're getting me a new SAAB.
S09E05,GEORGE,What about your old car? They couldn't get Kramer's blood out of it?
S09E05,JERRY,"No, the engine clotted. You know who set this whole thing up for me? Frank Merman."
S09E05,GEORGE,Fragile Frankie Merman? I never liked that guy.
S09E05,JERRY,Why? He's harmless.
S09E05,GEORGE,Every summer you guys went to camp together. I was jealous. Felt like he was the summer me.
S09E05,JERRY,"He was not the summer you. Besides, you had a summer me. Whitey Fisk, the guy who snuck you into Last Tango in Paris."
S09E05,GEORGE,I made him up.
S09E05,JERRY,So you never saw Last Tango in Paris?
S09E05,GEORGE,No.
S09E05,JERRY,Too bad. It was erotic.
S09E05,KRAMER,(enters) Well... I've had it with these jackbooted thugs!
S09E05,JERRY,'Pottery Barn'?
S09E05,KRAMER,I got three 'Pottery Barn' catalogs in one day. That makes eight this month.
S09E05,GEORGE,(holding a magazine cover) Mira Sorvino. Think she'd go out with me?
S09E05,JERRY,Why don't you just throw 'em out?
S09E05,KRAMER,"Oh, no. I've been saving them up here in your apartment. And now, it's payback time. 'Pottery Barn' is in for a world of hurt."
S09E05,JERRY,(taking a catalog) Can I have one? I need one of those old-looking phones. So you wanna grab a bite?
S09E05,GEORGE,I can't. I gotta make the weekly call to the folks.
S09E05,JERRY,So call now.
S09E05,GEORGE,"I gotta prep. I need a couple of anecdotes, a few you-were-right-abouts. It's a whole procedure. Wasn't Fragile Frankie the one that used to run into the woods every time he got upset?"
S09E05,JERRY,That's him.
S09E05,GEORGE,Is he still nuts?
S09E05,JERRY,"What do you think? They gave me a new car for thirty minutes of 'So, who's from out of town?'"
S09E05,PUDDY,"(finishing eating) Seriously, is this the best okra you've ever had, or what?"
S09E05,ELAINE,Mmm. De-lish.
S09E05,PUDDY,Delish?
S09E05,ELAINE,"Delish. You know, short for delicious."
S09E05,PUDDY,"Oh, like scrump."
S09E05,ELAINE,Yeah.
S09E05,PUDDY,(leaving) I'm gonna be late. See ya later.
S09E05,JACK,"Excuse me, can I borrow your ketchup?"
S09E05,ELAINE,"(passing him the ketchup) Oh, sure."
S09E05,JACK,Thank you.
S09E05,ESTELLE,(answering the phone) Hello?
S09E05,GEORGE,"Hey, it's Georgie."
S09E05,ESTELLE,Let me put your father on the phone.
S09E05,GEORGE,Ma!
S09E05,FRANK,Who is this?
S09E05,GEORGE,"Dad, it's me. Hey, listen, I was at Fortunoff's the other day, and, you know what, you were right."
S09E05,ESTELLE,"(feigning a Chinese, muffled voice) Chinese food."
S09E05,FRANK,"(hanging up) Sorry, George, our Chinese food just came. Talk to you later."
S09E05,GEORGE,Chinese food?
S09E05,KRAMER,"(throwing his catalogs in the Pottery Barn store) Hey, you like sending out catalogs!? How do you like gettin' 'em back!?"
S09E05,JERRY,"So, maybe they had Chinese food?"
S09E05,GEORGE,"After dark? Please. At their age, that's like swallowing stun grenades."
S09E05,JERRY,"Well, there's one way to check. Where there's Chinese food, there's leftovers."
S09E05,ELAINE,"(enters) Well, gentlemen. Lainie is... in love."
S09E05,GEORGE,"That's dynamite. Yeah, I'll look for the Chinese food leftovers."
S09E05,ELAINE,"Hey, hey, hey! I met this guy! And it was like this, totally unreal, fairy tale moment."
S09E05,JERRY,"It wasn't Whitey Fisk, was it?"
S09E05,ELAINE,"Oh, George's friend. Whatever happened to him?"
S09E05,GEORGE,"Nothing. Uh, I don't know. I gotta go."
S09E05,JERRY,"So, this is beautiful. You, and Puddy, and this new guy, in a big pot of love stew."
S09E05,ELAINE,"Oh, yeah... Puddy. Well, I won't fire him until I see if this new guy can... handle the workload."
S09E05,KRAMER,"(entering Jerry's apartment) Will you look at this? More catalogs! 'Omaha Steaks', 'Mac Warehouse', 'Newsweek'?! I can't stop all these companies, so, I'm gonna attack this problem at the choke point."
S09E05,JERRY,Stop the mail?
S09E05,KRAMER,That's... even better!
S09E05,FRANKIE,Jerry!
S09E05,JERRY,"Hey, Frankie! So, where's the car?"
S09E05,FRANKIE,This is it.
S09E05,JERRY,Inside the van?
S09E05,FRANKIE,"It is the van! Don't you remember, we always talked about how cool it would be to have a van and just drive?"
S09E05,JERRY,We were ten.
S09E05,FRANKIE,Come on. Let's take it for a spin.
S09E05,JERRY,I don't want a van.
S09E05,ELAINE,"Well, just tell him you want the SAAB."
S09E05,JERRY,"You don't understand. This is Fragile Frankie Merman. When we were in camp, if you upset him, he'd run out to the woods, dig a hole, and sit in it."
S09E05,ELAINE,"Well, I have an idea. Keep the van, and get a bumper sticker that says, 'If this vans a-rockin', don't come a-knockin'.'"
S09E05,JERRY,Always helpful.
S09E05,ESTELLE,"Oh, Georgie, what are you doing here?"
S09E05,GEORGE,"Just dropped in for a visit. You, uh, you never called me back."
S09E05,ESTELLE,Uh... the phone broke.
S09E05,FRANK,"Well, we got to get moving."
S09E05,GEORGE,What? Where are you going?
S09E05,FRANK,We have a catered affair.
S09E05,GEORGE,You're going like that?
S09E05,FRANK,"(leaving the kitchen) It's creative black tie. Move, woman."
S09E05,GEORGE,(checking the fridge) No Chinese leftovers. George is gettin' suspicious.
S09E05,JACK,"Elaine, I'm sorry I'm late."
S09E05,JACK,I'm gonna be in the can.
S09E05,ELAINE,"Okay, Jack. (to the cashier) Can I use your phone?"
S09E05,CASHIER (Ruthie Cohen),Sure.
S09E05,Elaine,"(over the phone) Puddy? It's Elaine. We're through. Yeah, that's right. Again."
S09E05,FRANKIE,"(in the van with Jerry) Nice captain's chairs, huh?"
S09E05,JERRY,"Aye, aye."
S09E05,FRANKIE,"Oh, there's a spot. Just back up."
S09E05,JERRY,Hold on. There must be a truck backing up.
S09E05,FRANKIE,"No, that's us."
S09E05,JERRY,"Great. You know, Frankie, I was wondering. What if I decided that it's silly to drive a van, because, you know, I live in New York City. Is there maybe some way I could exchange it?"
S09E05,FRANKIE,You don't like the van?
S09E05,JERRY,"No, no, no. Just hypothetically."
S09E05,FRANKIE,I gotta go to the park.
S09E05,JERRY,"No! No, you don't! No woods. I love the van. I'm a van guy."
S09E05,KRAMER,"(showing Jerry his mailbox) Check it out. Rain and sleet may not stop them, but let's see them get by... these bricks."
S09E05,JERRY,Where'd you get the bricks?
S09E05,KRAMER,"Jerry, the whole building is brick."
S09E05,JERRY,So you want to take a ride with me out to Jersey? I'm gonna try to sell the van to a lot.
S09E05,KRAMER,"A dealer? Are you insane? No, take out an ad. Sell it privately."
S09E05,JERRY,I don't think I want to meet the people that are in the market for a used van.
S09E05,KRAMER,"Come on, Jerry, just let me help you."
S09E05,JERRY,OK.
S09E05,KRAMER,"All right! OK! Right, here we go. Yeah. OK, so... 'For sale. A big, juicy van.' And, ooh, you gotta put down, 'interesting trades considered.'"
S09E05,JERRY,I don't want to trade.
S09E05,KRAMER,"No, you don't have to. It's all about tickling their buying bone."
S09E05,JERRY,"Hey, you know what? This is all your mail. They're puttin' it in my box now."
S09E05,KRAMER,"Oh, that's it. They have gone too far. They keep pushing me, and pushing me. Now I got no choice but to go down there... and talk to them."
S09E05,ELAINE,"Hey, Jerry. I'd like you to meet someone. This is Jack. (Heraldic harp sounds as Jerry looks at Jack's face)"
S09E05,POSTAL EMPLOYEE,May I help you?
S09E05,KRAMER,"Yeah, I'd like to cancel my mail."
S09E05,POSTAL EMPLOYEE,Certainly. How long would you like us to hold it?
S09E05,KRAMER,"Oh, no, no. I don't think you get me. I want out, permanently."
S09E05,NEWMAN,"I'll handle this, Violet. Why don't you take your three hour break? Oh, calm down, everyone. No one's cancelling any mail."
S09E05,KRAMER,"Oh, yes, I am."
S09E05,NEWMAN,What about your bills?
S09E05,KRAMER,The bank can pay 'em.
S09E05,NEWMAN,The bank. What about your cards and letters?
S09E05,KRAMER,"E-mail, telephones, fax machines. Fedex, telex, telegrams, holograms."
S09E05,NEWMAN,"All right, it's true! Of course nobody needs mail. What do you think, you're so clever for figuring that out? But you don't know the half of what goes on here. So just walk away, Kramer. I beg of you."
S09E05,SUPERVISOR,"Is everything all right here, Postal Employee Newman?"
S09E05,NEWMAN,"Yes, sir, I believe everything is all squared away. Isn't it, Mr. Kramer?"
S09E05,KRAMER,"Oh, yeah. As long as I stop getting mail!"
S09E05,GEORGE,(surprising his parents in the kitchen) Welcome back.
S09E05,ESTELLE,Oh!
S09E05,GEORGE,Quick for a... catered affair.
S09E05,FRANK,I don't know what you mean.
S09E05,GEORGE,You ditched me. That's twice. Now I demand to know what's going on!
S09E05,FRANK,"George, we've had it with you. Understand? We love you like a son, but even parents have limits."
S09E05,ESTELLE,"The breakups, the firings. And every Sunday with the calls."
S09E05,FRANK,What my wife is trying to say is that this is supposed to be our time.
S09E05,GEORGE,I'm not following.
S09E05,FRANK,We're cuttin' you lose.
S09E05,GEORGE,You're cuttin' me loose?
S09E05,FRANK,"Now, if you'll excuse me, I'm going to make love to your mother."
S09E05,GEORGE,They don't want to see me anymore!
S09E05,JERRY,But this is what you've always wanted.
S09E05,GEORGE,It is. I'm just not ready yet.
S09E05,JERRY,"Aw, that's kind of sweet."
S09E05,GEORGE,"Ah, shut up, Jerry. My parents think they can ignore me. Heh heh. Well, they better think again."
S09E05,JERRY,"Oh, no. George, please. What are you going to do?"
S09E05,GEORGE,You remember my cousin Rhisa? I'm gonna date her.
S09E05,JERRY,Mother of God.
S09E05,GEORGE,"One little wink. She'll freak out, tell my parents. They'll be all over me. Who is this guy?"
S09E05,JERRY,"That guy Elaine's dating seems really familiar to me. I think he may have been a comedian I worked with one time. Wait a minute, what is this?"
S09E05,JERRY,That is the guy!
S09E05,GEORGE,Elaine's in love with the Wiz guy?
S09E05,JERRY,"No, she thinks she's in love with him. But she's just remembering this old commercial."
S09E05,GEORGE,That's pretty pathetic.
S09E05,JERRY,I know. They're not even related.
S09E05,ELAINE,(enters) Hey.
S09E05,GEORGE,Uh... hey. I'm gonna get going.
S09E05,JERRY,"Hey, have fun at the... family reunion. (George exits) So, what do you know about this Jack fellow?"
S09E05,ELAINE,Isn't he the best?
S09E05,JERRY,"Yeah, nobody beats him. What kind of work does he do?"
S09E05,ELAINE,"Oh, right now he's a fact checker for New York Magazine. It's not much, but it has a certain type of quiet dignity."
S09E05,JERRY,"(turning on the commercial) Right, quiet dignity. As opposed to, say, this?"
S09E05,ELAINE,"Oh, no."
S09E05,JERRY,"Oh, yes."
S09E05,JERRY,"(answering the phone) Hello? Yeah, the van is still for sale. Sure, come on buy."
S09E05,KRAMER,"(rushing into Jerry's apartment) Yeah, I called about the van."
S09E05,GEORGE,(at dinner with his cousin) Some more merlot?
S09E05,RHISA,"Yeah, thanks."
S09E05,GEORGE,"Sure. You know, Rhisa. I've always found you... very attractive."
S09E05,RHISA,What?
S09E05,GEORGE,"I know it may sound shocking. But, I just can't stop myself from... wanting you."
S09E05,RHISA,"You want to borrow money, right?"
S09E05,GEORGE,"No, no. I-I just want us to be... together."
S09E05,RHISA,All right.
S09E05,GEORGE,All right?
S09E05,RHISA,Let's go for it.
S09E05,GEORGE,Well... we could dance around it a little first.
S09E05,RHISA,"(playing footsie) Nah. Let's be bad, George. Let's be really... bad."
S09E05,GEORGE,Whoa! Whoa! Geez!
S09E05,KRAMER,"(inspecting Jerry's van) So, how come you're selling it?"
S09E05,JERRY,You know why I'm selling it. I hate it.
S09E05,KRAMER,How many miles?
S09E05,JERRY,Two.
S09E05,KRAMER,City or highway?
S09E05,JERRY,"Look, do you really want to buy this thing, or what?"
S09E05,KRAMER,"(breaking the antenna) Hey, hey. Take it easy. I'm not gonna be pressured. I'll walk away right now. Is this thing bent? I'm not paying for that."
S09E05,JERRY,"All right, just get out of here."
S09E05,KRAMER,"All right, look. I'm going to be honest. I'm very interested in the van."
S09E05,JERRY,"OK, fine. 'What do I have to do to put you in this van today?'"
S09E05,KRAMER,"(pointing to the newspaper ad) Well, I don't really have any money. But it says right here, 'interesting trades considered'."
S09E05,JERRY,You put that in!
S09E05,KRAMER,(pulling out an undershirt) And I'm glad I did. Here.
S09E05,JERRY,You want to trade me an undershirt?
S09E05,KRAMER,"No, I want to trade you screen legend Anthony Quinn's undershirt. He took this off to do sit-ups in the park and I nabbed it."
S09E05,JERRY,That's disgusting.
S09E05,KRAMER,"Well, it's my final offer."
S09E05,PUDDY,You dumped me for some idiotic TV pitchman.
S09E05,ELAINE,"Look, I'm sorry, Puddy. It-it was a mistake. So, let's just put it behind us, and we can continue like this never happened."
S09E05,PUDDY,"Gee, I don't know. What if we're out somewhere and you see the Maytag repairman."
S09E05,ELAINE,You're not taking me back?
S09E05,PUDDY,(leaving) That's right.
S09E05,ELAINE,He's not idiotic. He's the Wiz. And nobody beats him. Nobody...
S09E05,KRAMER,"(handing out anti-mail pamphlets) Here you go. Mail is evil. Pass it on. Hey, mail blows. Fax it to a friend."
S09E05,WOMAN,Why does this dummy have a bucket on its head?
S09E05,KRAMER,Because we're blind to their tyranny.
S09E05,WOMAN,Then shouldn't you be wearing the bucket?
S09E05,KRAMER,"Yeah. Move along, Betty."
S09E05,FRANKIE,"Is this, uh, Jerry Seinfeld's van?"
S09E05,KRAMER,"Well, not anymore. He traded it to me for some Hollywood memorabilia."
S09E05,FRANKIE,"I'm, uh, I'm so stupid."
S09E05,KRAMER,What?
S09E05,FRANKIE,"(running away) I'm so stupid. Uh, excuse me. I'm sorry."
S09E05,KRAMER,"Yeah, nice to meet you."
S09E05,JERRY,She's into it?
S09E05,GEORGE,She's leaving me dirty messages on my answering machine.
S09E05,JERRY,So have your parents found out about it?
S09E05,GEORGE,She wants to keep it quiet. She... thinks we have a real future together.
S09E05,JERRY,"Brave new world, alright."
S09E05,KRAMER,"(entering Monk's) Hey, you guys."
S09E05,JERRY,"Hey, how's the anti-mail campaign going?"
S09E05,KRAMER,"Oh, it's fantastic. We were out in front of the post office today, and not one person went in."
S09E05,JERRY,It's Sunday.
S09E05,GEORGE,Why is the mailman wearing a bucket?
S09E05,KRAMER,"Huh? Well, it symbolizes our persecution."
S09E05,GEORGE,Then... shouldn't you be wearing the bucket.
S09E05,JERRY,"Hey, I want my van keys back."
S09E05,KRAMER,"Oh, well. I, uh, thought we made a deal for Quinn's t-shirt."
S09E05,JERRY,Are you insane? Give 'em to me.
S09E05,KRAMER,"No, I can't, I can't. See, I told Frank he could borrow it. Yeah, he wants to move some of George's stuff into storage."
S09E05,GEORGE,"Wait a minute? He's picking up the van tonight? This is perfect. I'll drive Rhisa to someplace romantic. Then when my father slides the door open, I'm in the van kissing his brother's daughter."
S09E05,KRAMER,"Oh, listen, Jerry. One of your friends came by and he was very upset that I had your wheels."
S09E05,JERRY,"Oh, no, not Frankie."
S09E05,KRAMER,"Well, I didn't catch his name, but then he went running into the park."
S09E05,JERRY,"Oh, no, the woods! The hole!"
S09E05,KRAMER,(seeing Newman pull up along side him in his truck) Hey.
S09E05,NEWMAN,"Kramer, what the hell are you doing?"
S09E05,KRAMER,"I know, I'm gonna switch the bucket to something else."
S09E05,NEWMAN,Not that!
S09E05,KRAMER,What?
S09E05,NEWMAN,"You're in trouble, Kramer. I shouldn't even be talking to you, but I'm telling you as a friend. Here's how it's going to happen you may be walking. Maybe on a crisp, autumn day just like today. When a mail truck will slow beside you, and a door will open, and a mailman you know, maybe even trust, will offer to give you a lift."
S09E05,KRAMER,Are you through?
S09E05,NEWMAN,No! And no one will ever see you again!
S09E05,KRAMER,Are you through?
S09E05,NEWMAN,"Yes. No, wait! OK, yes."
S09E05,NEWMAN,(seeing postal security officials walking towards Kramer) Quick! Get in!
S09E05,KRAMER,"Oh, no, no, no. That's exactly how you said it was going down."
S09E05,NEWMAN,"There's another way it can go down, and it's going down right now!"
S09E05,KRAMER,"No. You said a mailman I know, and you're a mailman I know!"
S09E05,NEWMAN,"I know you know, but you don't know what I know."
S09E05,KRAMER,(being grabbed by the security officials) Hey!
S09E05,JERRY,"Frankie! Frankie! Frankie! Frankie, is that you?"
S09E05,HOLE DIGGER,My name is Edgar.
S09E05,JERRY,Have a nice night.
S09E05,HOLE DIGGER,Thank you.
S09E05,FRANKIE,"(digging a hole, talking to himself, and seeing Jerry's van pull up near him) Stupid... so stupid! Jerry?"
S09E05,RHISA,"All right, George. I'm ready."
S09E05,GEORGE,"Yeah, hold on. I'm, uh, I'm just trying to get a reading on my dashboard compass. Where are my parents?"
S09E05,RHISA,Geor-gie...
S09E05,FRANKIE,(running up to the van and yelling through the window) Is this Seinfeld's van? Seinfeld's van? Seinfeld's van?!
S09E05,RHISA,(hearing Frankie as George runs to the back of the van) Wait. What's he saying?
S09E05,GEORGE,"I think he's saying 'Son of Sam'! Oh, my God!"
S09E05,RHISA,"No, they caught him."
S09E05,GEORGE,(running out and away from the van) I knew it wasn't Berkowitz!
S09E05,FRANKIE,(seeing George running away) Ohh...
S09E05,ELAINE,"So I told him, 'Hit the road. I'm going back with Jack.'"
S09E05,JACK,"Elaine, that's the second piece of good news today."
S09E05,ELAINE,"Really, what was the first?"
S09E05,JACK,(pulling out his Wiz hat) They're bringing me back. Yeah. I'm the Wiz again.
S09E05,ELAINE,What?
S09E05,JACK,(dancing around) I'm the Wiz! I'm the Wiz!
S09E05,ELAINE,"Well what, what about your fact-checking job?"
S09E05,JACK,"(dancing around) Oh... here's a fact. Uh, I'm... the Wiz! I'm the Wiz and noooobody beats me!"
S09E05,JERRY,"(finding Frankie, in his hole) Frankie... come on out of there."
S09E05,FRANKIE,You hate the van.
S09E05,JERRY,"But I'm keeping it. As much as I hate the idea of being a van guy, it's much better than hanging out here with the nocturnal dirt people."
S09E05,FRANKIE,"So, can we go for a ride?"
S09E05,JERRY,"Yeah, let's just get out of here."
S09E05,HOLE DIGGER #2,"(eyeing the empty hole, and getting into it) Are you done with that?"
S09E05,FRANK,(coming upon the van) Good. He left the door unlocked.
S09E05,ESTELLE,Why did Kramer have to park the van in the woods?
S09E05,FRANK,Isn't it obvious? There are no parking meters out here.
S09E05,ESTELLE,(looking inside of the van) Wow!
S09E05,FRANK,"(reclining the seats in the van to a bed) Hey, look at this. Hoochie mama!"
S09E05,POSTMASTER GENERAL,"Oh, my goodness. What have they done to you here?"
S09E05,KRAMER,Huh? Who are you?
S09E05,POSTMASTER GENERAL,"Well, you can just call me Henry."
S09E05,KRAMER,Henry Atkins? The postmaster general?
S09E05,POSTMASTER GENERAL,Last time I checked.
S09E05,KRAMER,Henry... can I get out of here now?
S09E05,POSTMASTER GENERAL,"Oh, oh. Sit a bit. Sit a bit. I mean, after all, I drove all the way up here from D.C. just to talk to you."
S09E05,KRAMER,Oh?
S09E05,POSTMASTER GENERAL,"I even had to cancel a round of golf with the secretary of state. Do you like golf, Mr. Kramer?"
S09E05,KRAMER,Yeah.
S09E05,POSTMASTER GENERAL,"Kramer, I've been, uh, reading some of your material here. I gotta be honest with you you make a pretty strong case. I mean, just imagine. An army of men in wool pants running through the neighborhood handing out pottery catalogs, door to door."
S09E05,KRAMER,Yeah! Ha ha.
S09E05,POSTMASTER GENERAL,"Well, it's my job. And I'm pretty damn serious about it. In addition to being a postmaster, I'm a general. And we both know, it's the job of a general to, by God, get things done. So maybe you can understand why I get a little irritated when someone calls me away from my golf."
S09E05,KRAMER,"I'm very, very sorry."
S09E05,POSTMASTER GENERAL,"Sure, you're sorry. I think we got a stack of mail out at the desk that belongs to you. Now, you want that mail, don't you Mr. Kramer?"
S09E05,KRAMER,Sure do!
S09E05,POSTMASTER GENERAL,"(receiving a salute from Kramer) Now, that's better."
S09E05,KRAMER,"(seeing Newman walk into the office with a bucket on his head, escorted by a security man) Geez. Newman?"
S09E05,NEWMAN,(whimpering) Tell the world my story.
S09E05,JERRY,"Hey, George!"
S09E05,GEORGE,"Jerry! Hey, that's the guy!"
S09E05,JERRY,"What? George Costanza, Frankie Merman."
S09E05,GEORGE,Oh. The summer me.
S09E05,FRANKIE,The winter me.
S09E05,JERRY,You must be George's cousin.
S09E05,RHISA,Girlfriend.
S09E05,JERRY,All right.
S09E05,GEORGE,(seeing Jerry's van shaking) What is that? That van's a-rockin'.
S09E05,JERRY,Don't go a-knockin'.
S09E05,ESTELLE,"(after George opens the van door) Oh, my god!"
S09E05,GEORGE,"(seeing his parents being intimate) Oh, my god!"
S09E05,FRANKIE,Now you gotta sell this van.
S09E05,JERRY,"Oh, yeah."
S09E05,FRANK,What you saw in that van was a natural expression of a man's love for his lady.
S09E05,GEORGE,Ohhhh...
S09E05,ESTELLE,Your father's right. It's beautiful.
S09E05,FRANK,And it was safe.
S09E05,GEORGE,"Oh, God..."
S09E05,FRANK,"Now if you'll excuse me. Once again, your mother and I..."
S09E05,GEORGE,Oh... make it stop.
S09E06,JERRY,I just think if you borrow my blender you should return it.
S09E06,KRAMER,Well whats the difference -- Come on (pats him on the back) -- were like Cain and Able.
S09E06,JERRY,"Yeah, ya know Cain slew Able."
S09E06,KRAMER,"No he didnt. They were in business together it was dry wall, or somethin."
S09E06,JERRY,"Oh, no."
S09E06,KRAMER,"All right then, what was it?"
S09E06,JERRY,"Well I think Able worked hard all summer harvesting his crops, while Cain just played in the field. Then when Winter came, Able had all the nuts; Cain had no nuts, so he killed him."
S09E06,KRAMER,"The way I remember it, Cain, he was a successful doctor, but when he took this special formula, he became Mr. Able."
S09E06,JERRY,"Ya broke my blender, didnt ya?"
S09E06,KRAMER,Yeah. Well I was trying to make gravel and it just (moves hands around) just didnt work out.
S09E06,JERRY,I knew it.
S09E06,JERRY,Why were you making gravel?
S09E06,KRAMER,Well ... I like the sound it makes when you walk on it.
S09E06,KRAMER,"Aahh, this looks familiar"
S09E06,JERRY,Of course. It's garbage.
S09E06,KRAMER,"No, no, no, no. These brown things. The chairs. (hits his hand on the rim) Jerry, this is the set from the old Merv Griffin Show! (he climbs into the dumpster) They must be throwing it out. This stuff belongs in the Smithsonian!"
S09E06,JERRY,"Yeah, at least in the dumpster behind the Smithsonian."
S09E06,KRAMER,"Look at this. Boy, one minute Elliot Gould is sitting on you and the next thing - you're yesterday's trash."
S09E06,JERRY,"Come on, Kramer, get out of there."
S09E06,KRAMER,"No, no, no. You go on ahead. I'm not finished taking this in. Oh, Jerry look ... Merv Griffin's cigar."
S09E06,JERRY,(moans) Ohhh (walks away)
S09E06,GEORGE,"You know I uh, spilled a yogurt smoothie in here two days ago. Hm, Can't smell anything, can ya?"
S09E06,MIRANDA,Banana?
S09E06,GEORGE,Right.
S09E06,MIRANDA,George watch out for those pigeons.
S09E06,GEORGE,Oh they'll get out of the way. You really smell banana?
S09E06,MIRANDA,"(gasp) Oh my God. (trying to catch her breath, she puts her hand to her chest.)"
S09E06,GEORGE,So uh where we eating?
S09E06,JERRY,And it was his idea to put a sprig of parsley on the plate.
S09E06,CELIA,You're making this up. There was never a Joseph Garnish.
S09E06,JERRY,Wow! (Jerry spots all the classic toys)
S09E06,CELIA,Oh yeah the toys.
S09E06,JERRY,Where did you get all these?
S09E06,CELIA,My dad was a collector. I inherited them after he died from a long painful bout with
S09E06,JERRY,"Super bowl! Hey, an original G.I. Joe. (picks up both items) With a full frogman suit."
S09E06,CELIA,"Jerry, what are you doing?"
S09E06,JERRY,I'm putting this on him and we're going to the sink.
S09E06,CELIA,Ohhh Jerry. (takes them from Jerry and puts them back with the other toys) They're priceless. They've never been played with.
S09E06,JERRY,"I just want a, touch em a little."
S09E06,CELIA,I said no. Now come here.
S09E06,LOU,"Hi (startled, Elaine spills her coffee on her sleeve) I'm Lou Filerman. I'm new here."
S09E06,ELAINE,"Hey Walter, what is the deal with that guy?"
S09E06,WALTER,uh-He's Lou Filerman. He's new here.
S09E06,ELAINE,(exhales)
S09E06,WALTER,Hey your coffee stain looks like Fidel Castro.
S09E06,ELAINE,You've been an enormous help.
S09E06,JERRY,You ran over some pigeons? How many?
S09E06,GEORGE,What ever they had. Miranda thinks I'm a butcher but i-i-it's not my fault is it? Don't we have a deal with the pigeons?
S09E06,JERRY,"Course we have a deal. They get out of the way of our cars, we look the other way on the statue defecation."
S09E06,GEORGE,Right! And these pigeons broke the deal. I will not accept the blame for this!
S09E06,JERRY,So Miranda's cooled on ya?
S09E06,GEORGE,I'm getting nothing.
S09E06,JERRY,"Yeah, me neither."
S09E06,GEORGE,Really? I thought you and Celia were sleeping together?
S09E06,JERRY,"Oh, the sex is wild but she's got this incredible toy collection and she won't let me near it!"
S09E06,GEORGE,I don't understand women.
S09E06,JERRY,Here comes one.
S09E06,ELAINE,Hey. What's going on?
S09E06,GEORGE,Hey (sees the coffee stain) Art Garfunkel?
S09E06,ELAINE,"No, Castro."
S09E06,GEORGE,Right.
S09E06,ELAINE,All because of this creepy new guy at work. He just - he just comes out of nowhere and he's right next to you!
S09E06,JERRY,So he just sidles up?
S09E06,ELAINE,That's right! He's a real sidler. (points at Jerry)
S09E06,JERRY,Maybe you just didn't see him.
S09E06,ELAINE,"Wha-You never see him. He sidled me again in my office. I was sitting there making Cup-A-Soup singing that song from ""The Lion King""."
S09E06,JERRY,Hakuna Matata?
S09E06,ELAINE,I thought I was alone.
S09E06,JERRY,That doesn't make it right.
S09E06,JERRY,"See, to me, the Hakuna Matata is not nearly as embarrassing as the cup of soup..."
S09E06,ELAINE,"Would you just, let it go?"
S09E06,KRAMER,"(from his apartment) Hey, Jerry! Come here a sec!"
S09E06,KRAMER,Hey! (moving a chair onto the set)
S09E06,JERRY,Oh my God!
S09E06,KRAMER,(Outstretched arms) It's the Merv Griffin set. (Claps 7 times)
S09E06,JERRY,How did you get this in here?
S09E06,KRAMER,"Oh, you just bring it in sideways and (pop) hook it."
S09E06,JERRY,So where you gonna sleep?
S09E06,KRAMER,Yeah ... backstage.
S09E06,ELAINE,Ehnn! This chair smells like garbage.
S09E06,KRAMER,"(putting on jacket) Oh, well a lot of the stars from the 70's - they were not as hygienic as they appeared on TV. You take Mannix for example."
S09E06,JERRY,I'm gonna get that. (walks across the set towards the blue curtain)
S09E06,KRAMER,"All right. Well, Jerry, we'd love to have you back anytime. (stretches his arm out, as if hes reaching out a good-bye)"
S09E06,KRAMER,"Well, Elaine Benes! Well, it's great to have you! (Elaine sits down) Boy, is it possible that youre even more beautiful than the last time I saw you?"
S09E06,ELAINE,(giggles)
S09E06,GEORGE,"Ahh, Ah-AhWe had a deal!"
S09E06,ELAINE,"Mr. Peterman, here are these pages that you wanted."
S09E06,PETERMAN,"One moment. I'm reading the most fascinating article on the most fascinating people of the year. Annnnnd, done. Oh, yes. I'm sorry I needed this so quickly (leafing through the pages). It must have been an awful lot of work. Thank you very much, you two."
S09E06,ELAINE,"What? (with arms crossed, she turns quickly and )"
S09E06,JERRY,So three dates and she still won't let me play with her toys.
S09E06,KRAMER,"Hm, That's interesting. You know someone mentioned to me you were not very happy with your toys, growing up."
S09E06,JERRY,"Yeah, that was me."
S09E06,KRAMER,"Oh, that's right, right, right. And uh you mentioned that uh, you didn't get a G.I. Joe. You had an"
S09E06,JERRY,An Army Pete.
S09E06,KRAMER,Right.
S09E06,JERRY,He was made of wood and in the rain he would swell up and then split.
S09E06,KRAMER,"And we all know how painful that can be. (as he says this, he turns and speaks directly into the non-existent television camera. Jerry looks a bit confused.)"
S09E06,ELAINE,Jerry. Oh there - -
S09E06,KRAMER,"Oh, Elaine Benes. Well, this is quite a thrill, yes. Come - - (motions for Jerry to move down one seat as the new guest has arrived for her segment. Kramer gives Jerry a little push) Come on sit down. Yes."
S09E06,ELAINE,"(clears throat) (to Jerry) Well, I'll tell ya, this sidler guy is really chapping my hide."
S09E06,KRAMER,"Ju - Excuse me. Yeah we're, talking this way."
S09E06,ELAINE,"Well, he's getting credit for work that I did! He's gonna sidle me right out of a job."
S09E06,KRAMER,"Ah, Now, for those of us who don't know, uh, sidling is what?"
S09E06,ELAINE,"Kramer, what is wrong with you?"
S09E06,KRAMER,What do you mean?
S09E06,ELAINE,"Well, for starters, you're looking at note cards"
S09E06,ELAINE,"(to Jerry) I'm gonna have to give that guy a taste of his own medicine, so, I am going to sidle, the sidler."
S09E06,JERRY,"You, sidle? Y-You ... you stomp around like a Clydesdale!"
S09E06,ELAINE,Not with these honeys. ... Wrestling shoes!
S09E06,KRAMER,(to the imaginary TV camera) Only in New York. ... ha ha
S09E06,GEORGE,Jerry?
S09E06,KRAMER,"Oh! (turns on the Merv Griffin theme music) Heeeyy! Well, ladies and gentlemen! It's our good friend, George Costanza! What a surprise!"
S09E06,TAPE RECORDER,Turn Music Off (Kramer pushes the off button turning the music off)
S09E06,KRAMER,"Yeah, sit, sit, sit Weeell! (laughing, clapping)"
S09E06,GEORGE,"Well, it happened again."
S09E06,JERRY,What happened?
S09E06,KRAMER,"Eyaaaya-ya-ya, I'll ask the questions. What happened?"
S09E06,GEORGE,Well I just stomped some pigeons in the park. They - they didn't move.
S09E06,KRAMER,"All right, let's uh, change the subject, ah. (looking at the yellow note cards) Now, uh you and uh, Jerry dated for a while. Tell us ah ... what was that like?"
S09E06,KRAMER,That was the wrong card.
S09E06,GEORGE,I-I don't get these birds! They're breaking the deal. It-it's like the pigeons decided to ignore me!
S09E06,JERRY,So they're like everyone else.
S09E06,KRAMER,"(laughs too loudly) All right, let's take a short break."
S09E06,KRAMER,"Okay ah, (checks his watch) We're back!"
S09E06,GEORGE,Boy that-that bank clock is-is eight minutes off.
S09E06,MIRANDA,Then why don't you just run IT over too?
S09E06,GEORGE,Zing.
S09E06,MIRANDA,"George, what are you doing?"
S09E06,GEORGE,Did you see that? That-that pigeon didn't move! I had to swerve to get out of the way! I saved that pigeons life!
S09E06,MIRANDA,What pigeon? You drove right into that squirrel. (leaves the car)
S09E06,GEORGE,"Squirrel? Well, we have no deal with THEM!"
S09E06,JERRY,"(sound of gunfire) Pkew, pkew, pkew, pkew, Pkeeew!"
S09E06,CELIA,Jerry! (she slides away from him)  Those hands! They never stop!
S09E06,JERRY,I'm sorry. Got any booze? What's say you and I get ripped!
S09E06,CELIA,No. Thanks. I have a headache. Can you just get me an aspirin?
S09E06,JERRY,All right.
S09E06,JERRY,"Ohh, will not cause drowsiness"""
S09E06,LOU,Here's the new copy you wanted.
S09E06,PETERMAN,"Ah, yes. Well this certainly looks like a lot of words. In record time. I'm very impressed ... with both of you."
S09E06,ELAINE,(winks and clicks) Thank you. ha ha ha ha. (sits down)
S09E06,PETERMAN,"Unfortunately, I am also disgusted. This is incoherent drivel! This is a total redo. And I'm assuming I need it right away."
S09E06,ELAINE,"Well, I guess we'll just have - (Lou has left) Ohh, just gimme that. (takes the papers and walks away)"
S09E06,JERRY,"Uhn-uh-uhn - Uhn-uh-uhn - - veeer, veeer, veeer, veeer, veeer, veeer, veeer, veeer A-Ha ha! Mission accomplished! Back to base, Joe. (singing) dee, de-de, de-de-de-de-de (Makes G.I. Joe swim off, legs kicking)"
S09E06,MIRANDA,Doctor is the squirrel going to live?
S09E06,DOCTOR,"There's been massive trauma. We could of course try to save him but, it would be costly, difficult and we'd have to send away for some special really tiny instruments."
S09E06,GEORGE,"Well, uh, are there any other options?"
S09E06,DOCTOR,"We, could put him to sleep."
S09E06,GEORGE,What might that cost?
S09E06,DOCTOR,Well it's by the pound. So ... about 80 cents.
S09E06,GEORGE,"Well? (Miranda hits George) I was just - I'm curious, that's all. We, uh. We'd like you to, do everything possible."
S09E06,DOCTOR,"He, um. He's not going to be the same, you know?"
S09E06,GEORGE,Yeah. yeah. I-I know.
S09E06,GEORGE,So they're flying the tiny instruments in from El Paso.
S09E06,KRAMER,El Paso? I spent a month there one night.
S09E06,NEWMAN,(laughs - T-heheheheheheheh) El Paso!
S09E06,JERRY,What's he here for?
S09E06,NEWMAN,eue-aaa.
S09E06,KRAMER,"Ah to take some of the pressure off of me. So, Jerry ah, what's going on with you? I understand there's a young lady in your life. mmm."
S09E06,JERRY,"Well, actually, it's kind of a funny story because she has this amazing toy collection and last night I finally got to play with them."
S09E06,KRAMER,"Well. Sounds like things are progressing. Do I hear, wedding bells?"
S09E06,NEWMAN,Are you married right now? (points at Jerry)
S09E06,KRAMER,Newman. (Kramer smacks Newmans arm)
S09E06,JERRY,"Actually she doesn't even know about the toys. I gave her the wrong kind of medicine and I, guess she passed out!"
S09E06,KRAMER,"What do you mean ""wrong kind of medicine""?"
S09E06,JERRY,She's even got that old Mattel football game that we love!
S09E06,GEORGE,"Oh, come on! You gotta get me over there!"
S09E06,KRAMER,"Wait a minute, wait a minute! You mean to say that you drugged a woman so you could take advantage of her toys? Let's pause a moment. (Newman starts the taped music) Jerry, now, what you do with your personal life is your business, but when you're on my set - you clean it up, mister!"
S09E06,NEWMAN,I told you he was a risk.
S09E06,JERRY,"Oh, like he's not just carrying you! And has been for years!"
S09E06,NEWMAN,"Yeah? Well, you bombed! That story stunk worse than these chairs!"
S09E06,KRAMER,"Smile, everyone! We're back!"
S09E06,LOU,"You wanted to see me, Elaine?"
S09E06,ELAINE,"Yes, Lou. (exhales) You've got a lot going for you. You're um ... you're spontaneous. You're, symmetrical. You're, uh, ... (spins around as Lou is behind her now) Ehh - you're very quick, aren't ya. Um, It's just that your..."
S09E06,LOU,My dead tooth?
S09E06,ELAINE,No. Your. (breathes)
S09E06,LOU,Not my breath?
S09E06,ELAINE,Uuhhh.
S09E06,LOU,What can I do?
S09E06,ELAINE,"Well, you should never ever go anywhere, (shakes a box of Tic Tacs) without these."
S09E06,LOU,"Thanks, Elaine. You're such a super lady! (he opens the door and goes into the hall - now he clicks and clacks when he walks)"
S09E06,GEORGE,More wine and turkey? (Pours Celia more wine)
S09E06,CELIA,Hmm. (takes a sip)
S09E06,JERRY,"So when I saw George on the street with an 18 pound turkey and a giant box of wine, I thought ... What a coincidence. We're just about to eat."
S09E06,CELIA,What is that stuff in turkey that makes you sleepy?
S09E06,JERRY and GEORGE,Tryptophan.* (*footnote - see end of script)
S09E06,CELIA,Ahh.
S09E06,JERRY,... I think. Have some more wine. (Jerry pours his whole glass of wine into her glass.)
S09E06,CELIA,What video did you get?
S09E06,GEORGE,Oh.
S09E06,JERRY,"Oh, George brought home movies of his boyhood trip to Michigan."
S09E06,GEORGE,Four hours.
S09E06,JERRY,More heavy gravy?
S09E06,GEORGE,"(playing with toys) Ahhhh, Yes! Touch down! Your turn, Jerry. (hands Jerry the Mattel Football. George starts playing with the Etch-a-sketch.)"
S09E06,NEWMAN,"Lately, though, I've been, uh, - I've been buying the generic brand of waxed beans. You know, I rip of the label I can hardly tell the difference."
S09E06,KRAMER,"We've officially bottomed out, mm. Who's our next guest?"
S09E06,NEWMAN,We got no one!
S09E06,KRAMER,We need a new format. We should shut down and re-tool.
S09E06,NEWMAN,What about a guest-host?
S09E06,KRAMER,I'll pretend I didn't hear that.
S09E06,MIRANDA,"Doctor, how's the squirrel?"
S09E06,GEORGE,Is he dead?
S09E06,DOCTOR,"No. Fortunately, the special tiny instruments arrived just in time. Would you like to visit him?"
S09E06,MIRANDA,Yes he would.
S09E06,DOCTOR,"You uh, You have 30 minutes. (Doctor exits. George turns and looks towards the doctor)"
S09E06,GEORGE,"So ... uh, squirrel."
S09E06,DOCTOR,"One more thing Mister Costanza, we just need to know what time you'll be picking him up tomorrow."
S09E06,GEORGE,What's that?
S09E06,DOCTOR,"Oh, we're discharging the squirrel. We think he'll be better off at home."
S09E06,GEORGE,He has no home. He's a squirrel.
S09E06,DOCTOR,"Hmm-hm. Your home, Mister Costanza. Just make sure he gets his medicine six times a day and keep his tail elevated. (exits)"
S09E06,JERRY,Maybe it'll be fun having a pet.
S09E06,GEORGE,"It's not a pet! It's a wild invalid! And it knows that I tried to kill it. As soon as it gets better, it's gonna gnaw my brain out in my sleep!"
S09E06,KRAMER,"Jerry, (claps) aaya - what are you doin' tomorrow? I want you to come by the set."
S09E06,JERRY,"What about my ""questionable material""?"
S09E06,KRAMER,"Nope, we got a whole new format. Edgy, youthful, plus ... we got Jim Fowler!"
S09E06,JERRY,"Jim Fowler? The animal guy from ""Wild Kingdom"" is coming to your apartment?"
S09E06,KRAMER,"Well, I practically raised his kids."
S09E06,GEORGE,That's perfect! He's a zoo guy! He take's care of animals. C-Can I bring the squirrel by?
S09E06,KRAMER,"What? Two animal acts on the same show? (turns to Jerry) What is this, amateur hour? Look, George, I'm sorry, maybe another time, all right? (drums table and exits)"
S09E06,GEORGE,I gotta get to Fowler. I know that he would take this squirrel off my hands. It's practically bionic!
S09E06,ELAINE,"Hey! (startles Jerry and George) ha ha ha ha. Nice sidle, huh? Speaking, of which I think Ive got that problem, solved."
S09E06,JERRY,Tic-Tacs work?
S09E06,ELAINE,He's a human maraca.
S09E06,GEORGE,"Boy, my knuckles are still cramped from that football game."
S09E06,ELAINE,You took him over to Celia's?
S09E06,JERRY,What? It's a victimless crime.
S09E06,ELAINE,What about the woman who's been drugged and taken advantage of?
S09E06,JERRY,"Okay, one victim."
S09E06,ELAINE,I think it's unconscionable.
S09E06,GEORGE,"Hey, last night, I found a whole Weeble Village right behind the EZ Bake oven."
S09E06,ELAINE,EZ Bake oven?
S09E06,ELAINE,Who wants cupcake?
S09E06,GEORGE,"Oh, me, me, me, me, me!"
S09E06,JERRY,"You know, that batter is, like, 30 years old."
S09E06,FRANK,(on TV) You step on it and it flushes.
S09E06,ELAINE,Why is your father giving a tour of a rest stop?
S09E06,ESTELLE,(on TV) Stop squirming.
S09E06,GEORGE,"Oh, don't look. T-This is the part where they change me."
S09E06,JERRY,You're like eight years old.
S09E06,ESTELLE,(on TV) Georgie.
S09E06,GEORGE,I was seven and a half.
S09E06,PETERMAN,That noise. That's the noise!
S09E06,ELAINE,What?
S09E06,PETERMAN,"That infernal rattling sound that has plagued me these past two days - and I could not find the source. In my office, in the hallway. Even in the men's room! Shame on you, Elaine!"
S09E06,ELAINE,"No, no, Mr. Peterman that wasn't me!"
S09E06,PETERMAN,That reminds me of the Hatian Voodoo rattle torture! You haven't gone over to their side have you?
S09E06,ELAINE,No Mister Peterman.
S09E06,PETERMAN,"Because, if I hear one more rattle - just one - your out on your can. And if you are undead - I'll find out about that too. (Exits)"
S09E06,ELAINE,(pushes Lou into the room) Lou! In here! (closes the door) We have to talk.
S09E06,LOU,"Oh, right."
S09E06,ELAINE,"(Takes the Tic Tacs away from Lou) Ooh, stop it! Bad voodoo. You gotta stop using these."
S09E06,LOU,Why?
S09E06,ELAINE,Because they're turning your teeth green?
S09E06,LOU,I only buy the white ones.
S09E06,ELAINE,"O-kay ... well then your teeth are green for a different reason. You just gotta stop carrying these, okay? Just ... just mouth wash."
S09E06,LOU,I can't. It burns my cankers.
S09E06,ELAINE,Binaca?
S09E06,LOU,Again.
S09E06,ELAINE,"Right, right, cankers. Um, I got it! Chew gum!"
S09E06,LOU,I hate gum. The only guy I ever liked came with the Mickey Mouse gumball machine. They stopped making that 20 years ago.
S09E06,ELAINE,"Well, stinky, this is your lucky day."
S09E06,KRAMER,"Okay. A little later, we're gonna be talking with animal expert, Jim Fowler."
S09E06,FOWLER,Where are the cameras? (he has a live Hawk perched on his arm)
S09E06,KRAMER,"But first, we're talking with, Jerry. (looks down to his yellow note cards) Okay, Jerry, uh, you uh, you drugged a woman in order to play with her toy, collection. How do you feel about that?"
S09E06,JERRY,It was great! I've done it a few more time since then.
S09E06,KRAMER,"And she doesn't know anything, about this?"
S09E06,JERRY,"No, not a thing."
S09E06,KRAMER,"Well, Jerry, we have a little surprise for you! Come on out, Celia!"
S09E06,CELIA,What kind of a sick twisted creep are you?
S09E06,NEWMAN & KRAMER,Woah.
S09E06,JERRY,"What, What is this? What is she doing here?"
S09E06,KRAMER,It's the new format. Scandals and Animals. Git gt gt.
S09E06,CELIA,"If you think you can drug me and play with my toys, you got another thing coming, buddy!"
S09E06,NEWMAN,Go girl!
S09E06,JERRY,"Well, what kind of woman drinks an entire box of wine?"
S09E06,NEWMAN and KRAMER,Ohhh!
S09E06,GEORGE,"Mister Fowler, I-I have a squirrel here that is a miracle of modern science! (laughs)"
S09E06,KRAMER,George I told you we're booked!
S09E06,FOWLER,Careful. Hawks and squirrels don't get along together.
S09E06,KRAMER,"Ohhh. another interesting confrontation. This could be spicy. Yeah, George bring him over."
S09E06,GEORGE,Uh.
S09E06,FOWLER,"No, you idiot! Hawks eat squirrels!"
S09E06,GEORGE,"Ahhhh, Ahh, Ah, Ahhh, Ahh, Ah!"
S09E06,KRAMER,(off camera) Are we getting this?
S09E06,JERRY,So the whole set was destroyed?
S09E06,KRAMER,"Well, the squirrel kept scurrying and the hawk kept clawing."
S09E06,GEORGE,"Well, at least we know the prosthetic squirrel hips work ... sorry bout the set."
S09E06,KRAMER,Ill tell ya it was a grind having to fill 10 hours a day. I'm not sure I was ready to have my own talk show set.
S09E06,MIRANDA,"I got the nut bread, George. Let's go. (exits)"
S09E06,JERRY,So the squirrel's gonna make it?
S09E06,GEORGE,"Yeah, he's in my bed. I'm sleeping on the couch."
S09E06,JERRY,On the couch? So you're...
S09E06,GEORGE,Still getting nothing!
S09E06,GEORGE,So go ahead pigeons. hu hu hu. Laugh it up. I'm getting in my car now and the last I heard ... we have NO DEAL!
S09E06,CELIA,"I'm glad you called, Elaine. I really needed to talk to someone."
S09E06,ELAINE,"Oh well, hey, I dated Jerry too. I-I know what a monster he can be. More wine and turkey?"
S09E06,CELIA,Who's he? (Lou)
S09E06,ELAINE,"Oh, he's nobody. Hey, listen, ... let me top that off for ya. (pours her glass of wine into Celias glass)"
S09E07,ELAINE,Hey.
S09E07,JERRY,Morning.
S09E07,ELAINE,"Look, this is crazy, I can't go on like this."
S09E07,JERRY,But why?
S09E07,ELAINE,I need some space.
S09E07,GEORGE,Does that mean I have to go too?
S09E07,JERRY,You don't think she's just talking to me?
S09E07,GEORGE,"Hey, shut up."
S09E07,JERRY,You shut up.
S09E07,ELAINE,I hate this.
S09E07,KRAMER,You'll get used to it. It's like a grubby scrub.
S09E07,ELAINE,"No, I don't want this anymore."
S09E07,JERRY,We'll come to work with you.
S09E07,GEORGE,And on your dates.
S09E07,JERRY,And shopping.
S09E07,KRAMER,And to the bathroom.
S09E07,"JERRY, GEORGE & KRAMER","Elaine, Elaine, Elaine, Elaine...(distant alarm sound which is getting louder.)"
S09E07,ELAINE,I can't breath...I'm sorry...(Elaine wakes up) You're killing me!
S09E07,(Elaine tries to push her alarm clock showing 3,"30. She realizes, that alarm comes from next door.)"
S09E07,ELAINE,(Banging the wall) Turn your alarm off!! (Screams)
S09E07,KRUGER,"Your background is impressive George, but how does it apply to what we do here, at Kruger Industrial Smoothing?"
S09E07,GEORGE,"Well, at the Yankees it was all about smoothing things over, you know, chiseling away, grinding down. In fact we used to call it 'the grind'."
S09E07,KRUGER,It says here that you worked at Play Now for four days?
S09E07,GEORGE,"That should be 14, let me just...(corrects it with a pen.)"
S09E07,KRUGER,"George, I have to honest; I could go either way with you...but what the hell, we need someone, huh."
S09E07,GEORGE,"You won't regret this, sir."
S09E07,KRUGER,I don't care. Let's find you an office.
S09E07,(Kruger leaves and George notices a photograph on the table,Kruger's family and George on the background.)
S09E07,GEORGE,...and then when I saw the photo I remembered where I'd seen him; the boom box incident.
S09E07,JERRY,The boom box incident?
S09E07,GEORGE,"Summer of '89 I'm at the beach. This family sits up next to me. I go in to the surfs and when I come from out, my clothes, my towel, my umbrella, they're all gone. I am furious, I start screaming to these kids demanding my stuff back and finally I lose it; I grab their boom box and I chuck it in to the ocean."
S09E07,JERRY,Seems reasonable.
S09E07,GEORGE,"Then I see my clothes floating out there. The tied took them out, not the kids."
S09E07,JERRY,Even more reasonable.
S09E07,GEORGE,"So now, the father is screaming at me, he's demanding that I pay for the boom box. Finally, I gave them a fake address and got the hell out of there."
S09E07,JERRY,And that guy is your new boss?
S09E07,GEORGE,Until that stupid photo jogs his memory.
S09E07,KRAMER,"Kruger? That's not Kruger Industrial Smoothing, is it?"
S09E07,GEORGE,Yeah.
S09E07,KRAMER,"Grinders, sanders, wet stones. They are the ones who botched the Statue of Liberty job."
S09E07,JERRY,"Right, they couldn't get the green stuff off."
S09E07,GEORGE,It is a horrible company. There's no management what so ever. I could go hog wild in there.
S09E07,KRAMER,You now what you do? You sneak that photo out of there for couple of days and get it air brushed.
S09E07,GEORGE,Like retouched.
S09E07,KRAMER,You remember that photo of me and Gerald Ford and I took it in. Got that Ford right out of there.
S09E07,GEORGE,"Oh, this is good. This Kruger guy is clueless. I can't wait to work for him."
S09E07,KRAMER,"Look at this. This sandwich is terrible. Everywhere you go, they give you this misshaped shardy meat. Look at this..."
S09E07,KRAMER,I haven't had a decent sandwich in 13 years.
S09E07,JERRY,Neither have I.
S09E07,KRAMER,"Hey, our meat problems are solved."
S09E07,JERRY,Where did you get this thing?
S09E07,KRAMER,"I traded it to my sausage press. Look how thin that is, see that's all surface area. The taste has nowhere to hide."
S09E07,ELAINE,Hey.
S09E07,KRAMER,"Hey, spice. (gives Elaine a piece of meat.) Welcome to flavor country."
S09E07,ELAINE,"Yeah, that's pretty good."
S09E07,JERRY,"Hey, I got a date with that doctor you met."
S09E07,ELAINE,Sara Sitarides?
S09E07,JERRY,Mmhu.
S09E07,ELAINE,Oh...(falls in to the sofa.)
S09E07,JERRY,What's with you?
S09E07,ELAINE,"You remember that next door neighbor of mine, the apartment that always smells like potatoes?"
S09E07,JERRY,Your whole building smells like potatoes.
S09E07,ELAINE,"This jackass goes to Paris, leaves the alarm on. It's been beeping since 330 this morning."
S09E07,KRAMER,"You know, that happened to Lomez, so he blew his neighbor's circuit."
S09E07,ELAINE,How do you do that?
S09E07,KRAMER,"Yeah well, that's easy. Just let me finish this mile high and I'll be right with you. Oh, and Jerry, we are gonna need a case of Kaiser rolls."
S09E07,JERRY,I think we might have one left in the stock room.
S09E07,KRAMER,This hallway smells like potatoes.
S09E07,ELAINE,"I know, I know, this is it. (points to a door.)"
S09E07,KRAMER,"Ok, oh, you see this socket it's probably connected to her apartment. So what we'll do, we'll take this paper clip and bend it so it'll short out the entire circuit. Here you go..."
S09E07,ELAINE,I think I'll let you do it.
S09E07,KRAMER,"No no no. It's easy, you just...do it quickly."
S09E07,ELAINE,"No, I really don't want to."
S09E07,KRAMER,"Well, I don't want to either."
S09E07,ELAINE,I thought you had done this before.
S09E07,KRAMER,It's just...it's no picnic.
S09E07,ELAINE,"Well, how are we gonna do it?"
S09E07,KRAMER,"Alright, fine fine, I'll do it."
S09E07,KRAMER,Oh mama.
S09E07,ELAINE,Are you okay?
S09E07,KRAMER,I will lose that nail.
S09E07,SARA,I enjoy the challenge of medicine. Naturally you have no idea what it's like to have someone's life depending on you.
S09E07,JERRY,"Well, I have this neighbor..."
S09E07,SARA,A joke. Do you have any idea how it feels like to save someone's life?
S09E07,JERRY,Is it anything like hitting a home run in softball?
S09E07,SARA,No.
S09E07,JERRY,Cause I hit a whopper last week!
S09E07,CLERK,"Here you go, airbrushed in to sand and sky."
S09E07,GEORGE,What did you do here? You took out the wrong guy.
S09E07,CLERK,I thought you said you wanted to be out?
S09E07,GEORGE,"Well, I'm still here. You took out the other guy!"
S09E07,CLERK,You've really lost a lot of hair.
S09E07,GEORGE,I am aware!
S09E07,Elaine thinking,"Hmm, the world's best pizza cutter. 76 bucks, how often do I make...oh, I've gotta buy a book."
S09E07,ELAINE,The cat.
S09E07,JERRY,He took out Kruger?
S09E07,GEORGE,I just pray Kruger doesn't realize that it's gone until this guy can fix it up.
S09E07,KRAMER,This slicer is indomitable.
S09E07,JERRY,Where did you get that butcher's coat?
S09E07,KRAMER,"You buy enough meat, they'll give you anything."
S09E07,ELAINE,"Kramer, my neighbor has a cat. When you blew the power, we must've shut off the automatic feeder."
S09E07,KRAMER,"See, that's the same thing that happened to Lomez."
S09E07,ELAINE,What did he do about it?
S09E07,KRAMER,"Well, he moved to a hotel and the cat eventually died."
S09E07,ELAINE,"Well, this meowing is absolutely worst than the alarm."
S09E07,KRAMER,"Oh, that's a prickly one."
S09E07,ELAINE,"Yeah, how's the doctor date?"
S09E07,JERRY,"Eh, died on the table. Just spent hour and a half making me feel, if I don't save lives, I'm worthless."
S09E07,ELAINE,"Well, she's very focused. Dermatology is her life."
S09E07,JERRY,Dermatology?
S09E07,ELAINE,"Yes, she's a dermatologist."
S09E07,JERRY,"Saving lives? The whole profession is; eh, just put some aloe on it."
S09E07,KRAMER,"The slicer! Elaine, let's go."
S09E07,ELAINE,Where are we going?
S09E07,KRAMER,The cat. Just grab that meat and let's ride.
S09E07,GEORGE,When are you going on your next date with her?
S09E07,JERRY,"Oh, what's the point?"
S09E07,GEORGE,"What, you're gonna pass up a wonderful opportunity to put that aloe pusher in her place?"
S09E07,JERRY,Revenge date? That sound like you more than me.
S09E07,GEORGE,"This good be so sweet, Jerry. Saving lives? She's one step away working at the clinique counter!"
S09E07,JERRY,Dermatologist? Skin doesn't need a doctor!
S09E07,GEORGE,"Of course not! Wash it, dry it, move on!"
S09E07,JERRY,You're right. I'm gonna call her right now and tell her off.
S09E07,GEORGE,"No no no no no, this has to be carefully orchestrated. You go to a fancy dinner, flowers..."
S09E07,JERRY,Flowers?
S09E07,GEORGE,"Yeah, you gotta do it classy (wipes his mouth to his sweater.)"
S09E07,JERRY,"So, you've done this?"
S09E07,GEORGE,Almost. Couldn't get the girl go out with me the second time.
S09E07,KRAMER,I think we are looking half a millimeter.
S09E07,ELAINE,Can it cut that thin?
S09E07,KRAMER,"Oh, I've cut slices so thin, I couldn't even see them."
S09E07,ELAINE,How did you know you cut it?
S09E07,KRAMER,"Well, I guess I just assumed."
S09E07,ELAINE,"Hold on kitty, dinner's coming."
S09E07,KRAMER,"Yeah, that's a hall of famer."
S09E07,ELAINE,"Alright, let's do it."
S09E07,KRAMER,"Alright, here we go. Yeah, watch that baby slide...(Puts a slice of meat under the door.)"
S09E07,ELAINE,"Come on, come on kitty...(slice disappears) ooh...how about that; it worked! Wow, can I borrow that thing for a while?"
S09E07,KRAMER,"Oh no, I don't think so."
S09E07,ELAINE,Why not?
S09E07,KRAMER,"Well, you're not checked at on it."
S09E07,ELAINE,What do I have to know?
S09E07,KRAMER,"Well, where the meat goes?"
S09E07,ELAINE,Right there.
S09E07,KRAMER,Where do you turn it on?
S09E07,ELAINE,Right there.
S09E07,KRAMER,But where does the meat go?
S09E07,SARA,"Restaurant, flowers...this is so nice."
S09E07,JERRY,"Well, I'm a classy guy. How's the life saving business?"
S09E07,SARA,It's fine.
S09E07,JERRY,"It must take a really really big zit, to kill a man!"
S09E07,SARA,What is with you?
S09E07,JERRY,You call yourself a lifesaver. I call you pimple popper MD!
S09E07,PARRY,Dr. Sitarides?
S09E07,SARA,"Mr. Parry, how are you?"
S09E07,PARRY,I just wanted to thank you again for saving my life.
S09E07,JERRY,She saved your life?
S09E07,PARRY,I had skin cancer.
S09E07,JERRY,Skin cancer! Damn.
S09E07,ELAINE,"You were right Kramer, this slicer is absolutely amazing...yeah, yeah...no no no I'll bring it by tonight...ok bye."
S09E07,ELAINE,These heals are so uneven. (Watches the slicer.)
S09E07,CLERK,Here you Mr. Costanza.
S09E07,GEORGE,What is this? This is a drawing.
S09E07,CLERK,"Looks real, doesn't it?"
S09E07,GEORGE,This is a cartoon!
S09E07,CLERK,"Hey, I had to draw that guy from memory. Considering, I think that's damn good."
S09E07,GEORGE,"But it's not a photograph, I need a photograph!"
S09E07,CLERK,Then you better get a camera.
S09E07,JERRY,He looks like a Peanuts character.
S09E07,GEORGE,"I know. The only way to fix it now, is to get a whole new photo of Kruger."
S09E07,JERRY,You can do that.
S09E07,GEORGE,Without his shirt on.
S09E07,JERRY,"You can't do that. Well, maybe Kruger wasn't the place for you."
S09E07,GEORGE,It seemed so disorganized.
S09E07,JERRY,I understand.
S09E07,GEORGE,"What about the Coast Guard? Seems like a lot of pride there, a lot of tradition."
S09E07,JERRY,"True. You mean, for you?"
S09E07,GEORGE,I think.
S09E07,JERRY,What about your sea sickness?
S09E07,GEORGE,Maybe I could be a land guy.
S09E07,JERRY,I don't know if they have land guys.
S09E07,GEORGE,Someone's have to unhook the boat before it leaves...the place!
S09E07,ELAINE,Pliers?
S09E07,JERRY,Drawer.
S09E07,ELAINE,Got it.
S09E07,JERRY,What are they for?
S09E07,ELAINE,I...eh...I got a piece a my heal stuck in a slicer.
S09E07,JERRY,Come again?
S09E07,ELAINE,"Okay, I got a little slicer happy, but listen; don't tell Kramer, okay? He has very strong feelings for it."
S09E07,GEORGE,I forgot to ask you; how did the revenge date go?
S09E07,JERRY,"Eh, it went okay."
S09E07,GEORGE,"Did you dressed nice, did you do it classy?"
S09E07,JERRY,"Yeah, I started out real classy..."
S09E07,GEORGE,"Yeah you did, you classed it up!"
S09E07,JERRY,But then I found out about the skin cancer.
S09E07,GEORGE,"Oh, so it backfired?"
S09E07,JERRY,Yeah.
S09E07,GEORGE,"So, I guess I was lucky that I never tried that myself."
S09E07,ELAINE,"Of course she treats skin cancer. That's how I met her, she was doing a skin cancer screening at Peterman. That's what dermatologists do."
S09E07,JERRY,"Sadly, that knowledge could've help me."
S09E07,GEORGE,"Wait a minute, she did a skin cancer screening at Peterman?"
S09E07,ELAINE,Aha.
S09E07,GEORGE,Could she do that at Kruger?
S09E07,ELAINE,"I don't know, I guess."
S09E07,GEORGE,"So I set up a screening, everyone takes their shirt off and click, I snap me a shot of a bear-chested Kruger."
S09E07,ELAINE,You have a little thing for this fella'?
S09E07,GEORGE,"Jerry, you gotta talk to Sitarides."
S09E07,JERRY,Yesterday you said I had to get my revenge on her!
S09E07,GEORGE,"And that was wrong, Jerry! You simple must to apologize.."
S09E07,JERRY,Must I?
S09E07,GEORGE,"Yes! Because it is the mature, adult thing to do."
S09E07,JERRY,How does that reflect me?
S09E07,KRAMER,"Elaine, alright where's the SP2000? Cause I gotta slice."
S09E07,ELAINE,"Aah, I forgot it. I gotta get home."
S09E07,KRAMER,"Ok, I'll go with you."
S09E07,ELAINE,"Umm, I'm not actually going straight to home, I have to first stop at the eh...circus, you know with all the...clowns."
S09E07,KRAMER,"Oh, well you have fun...(Elaine leaves) oh no clowns...hate clowns...the clowns."
S09E07,JERRY,"So again, I'm sorry. I had no right to yell at you, you're a life saving doctor and I'm just a comedian..."
S09E07,SARA,"Jerry, enough. I'll do your friend's cancer screening, because I believe in that, but as far as you and I are concerned; it's off."
S09E07,JERRY,Was it pimple popper MD?
S09E07,SARA,That's the one. (Taps Jerry on the cheek and leaves.)
S09E07,JERRY,Still got it.
S09E07,ELAINE,"Out, damn heal!"
S09E07,KRAMER,Elaine?
S09E07,ELAINE,Kramer?
S09E07,KRAMER,"Yeah listen, I need my slicer back."
S09E07,ELAINE,Just hold on!
S09E07,KRAMER,"Hey, what's going on?"
S09E07,ELAINE,"Nothing...(heal comes loose and Elaine opens the door.) Here, ok I'm on the phone alright? I'm on the phone with someone..."
S09E07,KRAMER,"My blade is all dinged up. Oh, come on! Elaine!"
S09E07,ELAINE,Phone call! I'm in a big phone call!
S09E07,KRAMER,"Come on, this is important! (Shakes the door handle and it comes loose. Kramer falls backwards to the next door.)"
S09E07,NEIGHBOR,"Hey, get the hell out of here!"
S09E07,KRAMER,"Wow, that's a lot of potatoes."
S09E07,KRAMER,"So, George took my slicer down to Kruger and they're smoothing it out for me."
S09E07,JERRY,What the hell is this?
S09E07,KRAMER,"Boy, that looks like an allergic reaction. Have you been wearing a fake beard?"
S09E07,JERRY,No.
S09E07,KRAMER,"Well, what have you been doing?"
S09E07,JERRY,"Nothing, I got up, run some errands, I went down to Sara's office and apologized..."
S09E07,KRAMER,"Whoa whoa, backup, Dr. Sitarides, what happened there?"
S09E07,JERRY,"Well, I tried to apologise, it didn't go over that well..."
S09E07,KRAMER,"There, there's your hives."
S09E07,JERRY,"What, she gave me hives?"
S09E07,KRAMER,"Jerry, as the Bible says; Thou who cureth, can maketh ill."
S09E07,JERRY,She did kind of touch my face.
S09E07,KRAMER,"Now you listen to me, you've got to find this woman and tell her that you're not a test tube pin cushion."
S09E07,JERRY,It does itch. Maybe I will go down at Kruger and talk to her.
S09E07,KRAMER,"Alright, great, because I got to get down there and pick up my blade. Hey, and I couldn't find that stock room."
S09E07,ELAINE,"Oh, that's fantastic."
S09E07,GEORGE,"I just talked to Mr. Kruger, he'll be down in a minute. He wanted me to take a photograph for the record."
S09E07,SARA,What record?
S09E07,GEORGE,"His personal file, I, I don't ask..."
S09E07,SARA,Jerry? What brings you here?
S09E07,JERRY,"I don't know, this? (Shows his neck to Sara.)"
S09E07,SARA,Looks like hives.
S09E07,JERRY,Where do you suppose that could've come from?
S09E07,GEORGE,"Jerry, what are you doing..."
S09E07,KRAMER,He is just setting the record straight.
S09E07,JERRY,"Come on Sitarides, cop to it. What brand of perverted science do you practice?"
S09E07,SARA,Are you suggesting I somehow I infected you on purpose?
S09E07,JERRY,"I want the antidote, pimple popper!"
S09E07,SARA,"That's it, I'm out of here! You're insane."
S09E07,JERRY,Am I? You touched my face. I didn't imagine that!
S09E07,GEORGE,"Dr. Sitarides don't go! Oh, thanks Jerry!"
S09E07,KRUGER,"Hey George, hey Doc. We doing the screening here?"
S09E07,GEORGE,"Aah, yeah, yeah. Won't you head on in, we'll be in in a second. Be right with you."
S09E07,KRAMER,"Doc, huh?"
S09E07,GEORGE,"Kramer, this is perfect. I need you to go in there, pretend you're a doctor and check this guy for moles."
S09E07,KRAMER,"Moles, yes. Freckle's ugly cousin."
S09E07,GEORGE,"And get a picture of him, with his shirt off."
S09E07,KRAMER,"You really are cooking up a little scheme here, aren't you?"
S09E07,GEORGE,"Alright, lets get in there. Quick, quick, quick..."
S09E07,ELAINE,This is it. I can take this anymore.
S09E07,(She turns the radio on loud (Foghat,"Slow Ride) and ""dances"" few little kicks.)"
S09E07,KRAMER,"Male mammal. Approximately 30 to 60 years of age. Weight...uh indeterminate. Ok, Mr. Kruger, we are gonna take a photo now for the records. So if you'll stand up please and give me a big smile, oh no no no, not that big. Yeah, that's nice, yes okay. Yes, let's have a looksee...ok, so eh, fiber from shirt on the left shoulder. I'm gonna have to keep my on that."
S09E07,KRUGER,How long have you been doing this Dr. Van Nostrand?
S09E07,KRAMER,"Uuh, long long time. Yes, I've seen moles so big they have their own moles. Freckles that cover two men."
S09E07,KRUGER,"So, how am I looking?"
S09E07,KRAMER,"Oh, so far, so good...(looks at Mr. Kruger's shoulder) yeuye..."
S09E07,GEORGE,"Kramer, I really owe you one."
S09E07,KRAMER,"George, we got a problem."
S09E07,GEORGE,What?
S09E07,KRAMER,"Well, he's got a mole on his shoulder. Very suspicious."
S09E07,GEORGE,"So, tell him you're concerned about it and he should see someone else."
S09E07,KRAMER,"George, why would I, a Juilliard trained dermatologist, send him to another doctor?"
S09E07,GEORGE,"Because, you're not a dermatologist."
S09E07,KRAMER,He thinks I am. I'm not gonna betray that trust. Here's what I wanna do; I think I can get a section...
S09E07,GEORGE,"Whoa, whoa, a section?!"
S09E07,KRAMER,"Yeah, if I could crab my slicer and he'd hold still..."
S09E07,GEORGE,"No, you're not taking a deli slicer to my boss..."
S09E07,KRAMER,"It'll be operative thing, he would barely feel it."
S09E07,GEORGE,No! Absolutely Not!
S09E07,KRAMER,"Well, it's my medical opinion, that you're making a big mistake. And it's going in my chart."
S09E07,[Elaine is on the phone and the radio plays music very loud (Iron Butterfly,In-A-Gadda-Da-Vida)]
S09E07,ELAINE,"Yeah, hello is this Allied Lock Smith?! Oh, finally, listen I need someone to come over here right away!"
S09E07,NEIGHBOR,Turn it off! Turn it off!
S09E07,ELAINE,"I am getting a lock smith, alright?! Relax!"
S09E07,NEIGHBOR,"Alright, that's it!"
S09E07,ELAINE,"Yeah, the address is 78th West..."
S09E07,NEIGHBOR,"Oh, oh mama..."
S09E07,JERRY,"So, Kramer pulled it off?"

S09E07,JERRY,"Well, that woman had it coming to her. Look at my neck, it looks like I had a beard of bees!"
S09E07,GEORGE,Why don't you see someone about it?
S09E07,JERRY,I've called everyone. You know how hard it is to get a dermatologist in this town? (Kramer comes in) A real dermatologist.
S09E07,KRAMER,(Points to a page on the book) Squamous cell carcinoma.
S09E07,GEORGE,You're not a doctor. You shouldn't even have books like this.
S09E07,KRAMER,"George, that's what he has and I have to give him a call. Now we gotta came clean."
S09E07,GEORGE,"You can't tell him the truth, you're gonna blow the whole thing."
S09E07,KRAMER,I don't want this on my conscience.
S09E07,GEORGE,I'll get him to see a real doctor. You just stay away from this.
S09E07,KRAMER,"Yeah, alright..."
S09E07,JERRY,"Hey, I wonder if they have a picture of my rash in here."
S09E07,KRAMER,"They've got everything there, Jerry. I underlined the best parts."
S09E07,JERRY,"Hey, this looks like the thing I have. Caused by exposure to benzene, a common ingredient in metal cleaners."
S09E07,KRAMER,"Well, that's weird."
S09E07,JERRY,What are you doing?
S09E07,KRAMER,"Well, I'm cleaning my slicer."
S09E07,JERRY,"That's my hand towel! I use that on my face, hands and chest! That's where the hives are coming from! It's not from Dr. Sitarides, it's from Dr. Van Nostrand!"
S09E07,KRAMER,"So, somehow the Bronzo (?) is reacting to the poison she's giving you."
S09E07,JERRY,"Alright, get out. And take your Bronzo with you (throws the bottle to Kramer.)"
S09E07,KRAMER,"Ohh, that's toxic. (Jerry throws the towel over Kramer's head.) Ououou...."
S09E07,KRUGER,"George, come in. I'm just going over our annual report...boy did we take it on the chin last year."
S09E07,GEORGE,"Eh, listen Mr. Kruger, I got a message from Dr. Van Nostrand and he says it might be wise to you to see another doctor about that mole."
S09E07,KRUGER,I'm not too worried about it.
S09E07,GEORGE,"Well, he said it could be cancer, maybe you should get it checked out."
S09E07,KRUGER,"George, take a look at this photo. This is taken 10 years ago. That mole looks exactly as it does today. So, there's no cause for concern, eh?"
S09E07,GEORGE,Whatever.
S09E07,KRUGER,"Actually, funny thing about this photo. We were at the beach and there was this dumb looking guy near by. When he went in for a swim, my sons and I took all his stuff and threw it in the ocean! What a pear shaped loser."
S09E07,GEORGE,"Well, that pear shaped loser was me! And I was in that photo, until I broke in here, stole the photograph and airbrushed myself out of there!"
S09E07,KRUGER,"Well, I'll be...you have lost a lot of hair."
S09E07,GEORGE,That's what they tell me!
S09E07,KRAMER,Do you want more pastrami?
S09E07,ELAINE,"Um, what was that last thing you gave me? That was pretty good."
S09E07,KRAMER,"Yeah, it was olive loaf. You want that?"
S09E07,JERRY,I can't believe Kruger didn't fire you after all you did.
S09E07,GEORGE,"He said he didn't care. Oh, God I love that place. Hey, have you seen other dermatologist?"
S09E07,JERRY,"Yeah, I finally got to see Dr. Kazarian. He said it was really bad."
S09E07,GEORGE,What did he give you for it.
S09E07,JERRY,Aloe. So where's that lock smith?
S09E07,GEORGE,Have to give him time on this hour.
S09E07,ELAINE,Can I have a zip? (Sticks a straw out from keyhole.)

S09E08,JERRY,No good. Too many people know the combination.
S09E08,ELAINE,(Confused) What combination?

S09E09,KRAMER,"(chuckling) Oh, Jerry, you know I can't do that."
S09E09,JERRY,"(standing in the bathtub) Now my sense of it is that you're probably wasting time working piecemeal, first cleaning one area, then another."
S09E09,KRAMER,"Well, that's how cats do it."
S09E09,JERRY,"But, when you have a faucet instead of a tongue, you want to use gravity."
S09E09,KRAMER,OK. Let's turn the water on now.

S09E09,HANKE,George.
S09E09,GEORGE,"You know, Jason, I, uh, I couldn't help notice, I... I didn't get my apology."
S09E09,HANKE,Apology? For what?
S09E09,GEORGE,A drafty apartment? A... sweaterless friend? A ball-game giveaway Metlife windbreaker?
S09E09,HANKE,"George, come on, not that neck hole thing."
S09E09,GEORGE,"Yeah, the neck hole thing, and I would appreciate it if you would say you're sorry."
S09E09,HANKE,"No way, you would've completely stretched it out."
S09E09,GEORGE,You're an alcoholic! You have to apologize. Step Nine! Step Nine.
S09E09,HANKE,"All right, George, all right. I'm sorry. I'm very, very sorry. I'm so sorry that I didn't want your rather bulbous head struggling to find its way through the normal-size neck hole of my finely knit sweater."

S09E09,MELISSA,"(grabbing the pickle jar and straining to open it) Oh, pickles! Unnhhhh! It's a tough one."
S09E09,JERRY,"Look, please stop! Let me help you with that!"
S09E09,MELISSA,(finally opening the jar) Unnnnh! Oooh. That's gonna leave a welt. Look at that.
S09E09,JERRY,(leaving the room) I can't. I can't look anymore. I-I-I've seen too much.
S09E09,ELAINE,"Peggy, we've got to talk. What is it about me that you find so offensive?"
S09E09,PEGGY,You seem to be with a lot of men.
S09E09,ELAINE,"What!? I happen to have a very steady boyfriend. You know, I mean, we broke up a few times and there has been an occasional guy here or... or there, but, wh-why is this your business?"
S09E09,PEGGY,It's not. Good day.
S09E09,ELAINE,"(leaving the room after rubbing Peggy's keyboard on her butt, sticking the stapler in her armpit, and coughing on her doorknob) Oh. All right. You think I've got germs? I'll give you some germs. How about some for your keyboard, huh? Huh? Oooh, how about for your stapler. Hmmm? That's good, isn't it? You have a happy and a healthy."
S09E09,JERRY,"Well, technically he did apologize."
S09E09,GEORGE,"Jerry, I felt like a straight man in some horrible sketch. He was riffing! Riffing! On my pain!"
S09E09,JERRY,"So now you want an apology for the apology, plus the original apology?"
S09E09,GEORGE,That's right. I'm two in the hole!
S09E09,JERRY,"Well, I hit the wall yesterday with Lady Godiva. She did a full body flex on a pickle jar."
S09E09,GEORGE,Did you explain to her about the good naked and the bad naked?
S09E09,JERRY,Where am I gonna get a fat guy and a cannonball?
S09E09,GEORGE,"Well... what if you showed up bad naked, huh? You still got that belt sander?"
S09E09,JERRY,Yeah.
S09E09,GEORGE,"(going into the bathroom) Well, you on all fours, that thing vibratin', kickin' up sawdust, ho ho! She'll get the picture!"
S09E09,JERRY,(answering the ringing phone) Hello?
S09E09,KRAMER,"Hey, Jerry, guess where I'm calling from!"
S09E09,JERRY,World War I plane?
S09E09,KRAMER,"No, I'm in my shower. Well, you know, I'm trying to get out of the shower sooner, and then I ask myself, 'Why?' I mean this is where I want to be. So I got a waterproof phone, I shaved, I brushed my teeth, and now I ordered a pair of chinos from J. Crew."
S09E09,JERRY,When are ya gettin' out?
S09E09,KRAMER,"I'm not! I'll see ya later, buddy."
S09E09,PETERMAN,"Bad news, people. Peggy is home sick."
S09E09,ELAINE,"Oh, please."
S09E09,PETERMAN,"She's stuffed up, achy, and suffering from intense malaise."
S09E09,ELAINE,"Oh, come on, we all have intense malaise. Right?"
S09E09,PETERMAN,"I just spoke with her, Elaine. She's in bed."
S09E09,ELAINE,"Yeah, let me tell you something this is all in her mind, OK? She is insane. She thinks I made her sick because I coughed on her doorknob, rubbed her stapler in my armpit, and put her keyboard on my butt. Yeah, she's a wacko."
S09E09,GEORGE,So you're Jason Hanke's supervisor?
S09E09,SPONSOR,Sponsor.
S09E09,GEORGE,"Whatever. Listen, I'm very concerned about this guy."
S09E09,SPONSOR,He's doing very well. He's already on to Step Ten.
S09E09,GEORGE,"Yeah, well when you don't actually do the steps, you can go through them pretty quick. You can get through six a day."
S09E09,SPONSOR,Is there some unresolved issue between you and Jason?
S09E09,GEORGE,"I don't know. A little thing called Step Nine? Instead of an apology, he was beboppin' and scattin' all over me."
S09E09,SPONSOR,I'm not sure what you want me to do.
S09E09,GEORGE,"Well, aren't you the boss of him? You shouldn't let him move up! When I was in the Cub Scouts, I got stuck on Weebolos for three years 'cause I kept losing the Pinewood Derby."
S09E09,SPONSOR,"You're quite upset, George."
S09E09,GEORGE,"Well, I think you should drop him down to Step Two."
S09E09,SPONSOR,Admit there's a higher power?
S09E09,GEORGE,"Yeah, let him chew on that for a while."
S09E09,Sponer,"You know George, I think I can help you. We're having a meeting tomorrow. Why don't you just come by?"
S09E09,GEORGE,"All right. That's more like it. Thank you very much. (giving the sponsor the 'be strong' hand clench) By the way, my uncle was an alcoholic, so..."
S09E09,KRAMER,"(on the phone in the shower) Lomez, you're not listenin'. Jerry likes the naked, just some of the things she does when she's naked. Calm down, I'm on your side. Geez. Hey, hold on a second. I got a clog, I'll call ya back."
S09E09,MELISSA,(naked on the couch) What are you doing?
S09E09,JERRY,"(naked, carrying a belt sander) I found a rough spot on the kitchen floor, I thought I'd polish it up with this belt sander I have here."
S09E09,MELISSA,"No, not that. Why are you naked?"
S09E09,JERRY,I thought naked is good.
S09E09,MELISSA,(eyeing him) This isn't good naked.
S09E09,SPONSER,"George, here, have a seat."
S09E09,GEORGE,(sitting down) Where's Hanke?
S09E09,SPONSER,(motioning to the leader) Shhhhh.
S09E09,LEADER,"OK, let's get started. Welcome to Rage-aholics Anonymous."
S09E09,GEORGE,What? Rate-aholics?
S09E09,SPONSER,"George, this can help you."
S09E09,GEORGE,"Hey, I am not here for rage. I'm here for revenge."
S09E09,LEADER,Excuse me. We have a 'no yelling' policy at these meetings.
S09E09,GEORGE,"Excuse me. Am I talking to you, Pinhead? Am I?!"
S09E09,LEADER,Please don't call me 'Pinhead'.
S09E09,GEORGE,I'm losin' it!
S09E09,JERRY,He took you to Rage-aholics? Why?
S09E09,GEORGE,Probably because this whole Universe is against me!
S09E09,JERRY,You've got a little rage.
S09E09,GEORGE,I know. And now they want me to bottle it up. It makes me so mad!
S09E09,JERRY,"By the way, my bad naked demo didn't quite work."
S09E09,GEORGE,This bread has nuts in it!
S09E09,JERRY,"(seeing Elaine enter Monk's) Oh, great. Elaine. What is wrong with my body?"
S09E09,ELAINE,Chicken wing shoulder blades.
S09E09,JERRY,That's it?
S09E09,ELAINE,"No, but that's one problem. Why?"
S09E09,JERRY,"Well, I was walking around naked in front of Melissa the other day--"
S09E09,ELAINE,Whoa! Walking around naked? Ahh... that is not a good look for a man.
S09E09,GEORGE,Why not? It's a good look for a woman.
S09E09,ELAINE,"Well, the female body is a... work of art. The male body is utilitarian, it's for gettin' around, like a jeep."
S09E09,JERRY,So you don't think it's attractive?
S09E09,ELAINE,"It's hideous. The hair, the... the lumpiness. It's simian."
S09E09,GEORGE,"Well, some women like it."
S09E09,ELAINE,Hmm. Sickies.
S09E09,KRAMER,"(in the shower, reading an instruction manual) Installing your Clarkman garbage disposal. Dismantle latch hasp beneath main drainage lot. Oh, come on, Clarkman."
S09E09,PUDDY,"(staring into space, picks up the phone) Puddy."
S09E09,KRAMER,"Is, uh, David Puddy there?"
S09E09,PUDDY,This is Puddy.
S09E09,KRAMER,"Well, this is Kramer."
S09E09,PUDDY,I know.
S09E09,KRAMER,"Um, listen, you're a mechanic. Could you help me install a garbage disposal?"
S09E09,PUDDY,"Well, it's a big job. You've got to dismantle the latch hasp from the auxiliary drainage line."
S09E09,KRAMER,No. It says 'main line'.
S09E09,PUDDY,"It's a misprint. What do you got, a Clarkman?"
S09E09,KRAMER,Yeah.
S09E09,PUDDY,"(seeing Elaine come in) Hey, man, I'll call you back. I'll talk you through it."
S09E09,KRAMER,"Oh, OK. Well, thanks, buddy."
S09E09,ELAINE,"Hey, Puddy."
S09E09,PUDDY,"Hey, Babe, your boss called. You owe five bucks for a balloon bouquet. Yeah, he says you can just give it to him tomorrow when you see him."
S09E09,ELAINE,Balloon bouquet? For who?
S09E09,PUDDY,Peggy took a turn for the worst.
S09E09,ELAINE,"Peggy. Oh, great. I suppose she's still blaming me?"
S09E09,PUDDY,That's what he said.
S09E09,ELAINE,I don't believe this woman.
S09E09,PUDDY,"Talk to me, Babe."
S09E09,ELAINE,She's this crazy woman who is convinced that my germs make her sick.
S09E09,PUDDY,"Oh, germ-o-phobe. I know what that's about."
S09E09,ELAINE,Huh?
S09E09,PUDDY,(showing her his necklace) I'm a recovering germ-o-phobe. Ten years.
S09E09,ELAINE,What is this symbol?
S09E09,PUDDY,It's a germ.
S09E09,PEGGY,"Elaine, it was very nice of you to bring the man you're currently sleeping with over to talk to me, but I assure you, I don't have any problem with germs."
S09E09,PUDDY,Don't you? Elaine.
S09E09,PEGGY,(flinching away) Please!
S09E09,PUDDY,I know it looks bleak. I've been there. Ten years ago waking up in bed next to a woman like this would've sent me running for the Phisohex.
S09E09,PEGGY,Really?
S09E09,PUDDY,I still have trouble looking at those disgusting old bedroom slippers she slogs around in.
S09E09,ELAINE,"Hey, I've had those since college. They're bunnies."
S09E09,PUDDY,They're bacteria traps.
S09E09,PEGGY,So you... just learned to live with it?
S09E09,PUDDY,For the most part.
S09E09,ELAINE,"OK, we're broken up for the rest of the day."
S09E09,JERRY,So I'm glad we had a talk and worked this out. Don't you feel this is better?
S09E09,MELISSA,This is nice.
S09E09,JERRY,"Yes, clothes. This is normal."
S09E09,MELISSA,"Hey, what are you doing tomorrow? I was thinking that we could go down..."
S09E09,MELISSA,"Jerry? Jerry, are you listening to me?"
S09E09,JERRY,Oh... yeah. What? I'm sorry.
S09E09,MELISSA,I wanted to know what you're doing tomorrow.
S09E09,JERRY,"Oh, maybe a haircut, and, I don't know, maybe a..."
S09E09,KRAMER,"(in the shower, on the phone with Jerry) So you broke up?"
S09E09,JERRY,"We couldn't carry on a conversation. I kept trying to picture her naked, she kept trying to not picture me naked."
S09E09,KRAMER,Hang on.
S09E09,JERRY,So what are you up to?
S09E09,KRAMER,"Oh, just cooking up a little thank you for Puddy. Hey, how do you make those radish roses?"
S09E09,JERRY,"Insert a knife into the center and twist. Then, to make it bloom, soak it in water for thirty to forty minutes."
S09E09,KRAMER,No problem there.
S09E09,HANKE,"George. Thanks for coming down to talk to me. I wanted to see you right away, but my hours here aren't very flexible. I just started yesterday."
S09E09,GEORGE,"Well, I'm here. What is it?"
S09E09,HANKE,"Well, I talked to my sponsor, and, uh, I've thought it over, and, you know, my apology at the coffee shop was sarcastic, and rude, and you deserve much better."
S09E09,GEORGE,"(ready to leave) Well, thank you."
S09E09,HANKE,You're welcome.
S09E09,KID,(entering the store) Can I get a Triple Minute Man Mint?
S09E09,HANKE,Waffle or sugar cone?
S09E09,GEORGE,"Uh, excuse me, uh, um, Jason. I don't want to get into a big thing here, but... I'm not sure if, technically, what you just said was actually an apology."
S09E09,HANKE,What?
S09E09,KID,Can you get on that cone?
S09E09,HANKE,"Would you hang on just a second, son? George, what are you talking about?"
S09E09,GEORGE,"Well, it's just, all you said was 'your welcome', which is nice. It's very nice. But... I feel I gotta get the apology."
S09E09,KID,Is there anybody else here but you?
S09E09,HANKE,"I'm alone, and it's my second day. You know, I don't even think we have that flavor so... George, really, enough, ok? You know, I-I admitted I was wrong, so what more do you want from me?"
S09E09,GEORGE,I would like an apology.
S09E09,HANKE,"All right, look, you know--"
S09E09,KID #2,(entering the store) Did you try it?
S09E09,KID,"No, this guy doesn't know what he's doing."
S09E09,HANKE,"Oh, yes I do. Yes, I do. OK? I'm interacting with someone here, if you can understand that. Now, I'm sorry."
S09E09,GEORGE,"Baah! There it is! You just said it! That's what I want! Now say it again, and tell it to me."
S09E09,HANKE,"I'm not saying anything to you. I'm not sorry. I was never sorry. It was cashmere. I hate Step Nine! Where's that Rum Raisin? Where is it? Can't find anything. I need a drink. Ah, daquiri ice. Here we go. What are you looking at? Get out! Come on, can't you see we're closed?! Get out!"
S09E09,ELAINE,"(eating dinner with Kramer, Elaine, and Puddy) Mmm. This food is fantastic, PEGGY And what a pretty radish rose, huh?"
S09E09,KRAMER,"Well, thank you."
S09E09,ELAINE,"Here's to Peggy, on her first week of being germ-free, free."
S09E09,KRAMER,Yeah. And here's to David Puddy for helping me install a much needed and much appreciated garbage disposal in my bathtub.
S09E09,PEGGY,You have a garbage disposal in your bathtub?
S09E09,KRAMER,"Oh, yeah, and I use it all the time. Yeah, I made this whole meal in there."
S09E09,ELAINE,This food was in the shower with you?
S09E09,KRAMER,Mm-hmm. I prepared it as I bathed.
S09E09,PUDDY,"Oh, germs. Germs. Germs!"
S09E09,GEORGE,"Excuse me. Is this, uh, Rage-aholics?"
S09E09,PUDDY,"(waiting with Elaine and Peggy) No, germ-o-phobes."
S09E09,GEORGE,Thanks. What are you guys doin' here?
S09E09,ELAINE,Kramer.
S09E09,GEORGE,Right.
S09E09,HANKE,"(speaking in front of other Rage-aholics) Hi, I'm, uh, Jason. I'm a rage-aholic."
S09E09,AUDIENCE,"Hi, Jason."
S09E09,HANKE,"Uh, this is my first meeting."
S09E09,GEORGE,Step-skipper. That man is a step-skipper! He skips Step Nine!
S09E09,HANKE,Please. Step Nine.
S09E09,GEORGE,That's right! He never apologized to me for saying that I would stretch out the neck hole of his sweater.
S09E09,GEORGE,It wasn't funny.
S09E09,HANKE,"It was a very nice sweater. Take a look at his neck, not to mention the melon sitting on top of it. I don't know if I'd trust him with a v-neck."
S09E09,GEORGE,"He's beboppin' and scattin', and I'm losin' it!"
S09E10,[Setting,Tim Whatley's apartment]
S09E10,ELAINE,"So.. Whatley's still Jewish, huh?"
S09E10,JERRY,"Oh, sure. With out the parents, it's a breeze."
S09E10,TIM,Hey! Happy Chanukah!
S09E10,JERRY,"Hey, Tim. Great party."
S09E10,TIM,(Suggesting a kiss to Elaine) eh?
S09E10,ELAINE,(Shrugging it off) eh.
S09E10,TIM,"(Accepting) Oh. (Turns to George) Hey, George, thanks again for getting me those Yankee tickets."
S09E10,GEORGE,"Oh, yeah. Still in good with the ground crew. (Laghs)"
S09E10,TIM,"(Notices a woman walking by) Oh, hey, listen, I'd better circulate.. (moving over to the woman) Happy Chanukah, Tiffany! (they both move off camera)"
S09E10,ELAINE,This place is like Studio 54 with a menorah.
S09E10,GEORGE,I'm gonna get some more of these kosher cocktail franks.. (leaves)
S09E10,ELAINE,Oh.. (sees a guy looking at her) I got denim vest checking me out. (laughs) Fake phone number's coming out tonight.
S09E10,JERRY,You have a standard fake?
S09E10,ELAINE,Mm-hmm.
S09E10,JERRY,"(Notices an attractive woman walking by, starts to follow her) That's neat."
S09E10,ELAINE,"(Holds onto Jerry's arm) No, please! Denim vest! He's smoothing it! Jerry! God! (Jerry excapes Elaine's grasp, moves over to the woman. The man wearing a denim vest moves over to Elaine.)"
S09E10,DENIM VEST,Hi!
S09E10,JERRY,"Hi, I'm Jerry."
S09E10,WOMAN,"Hi. JERRY You might not know it to look at me, but I can run really, really fast."
S09E10,ELAINE,Nice vest. I like the.. big metal buttons
S09E10,DENIM VEST,"They're snaps. Listen, maybe we should, uh, go out some time?"
S09E10,ELAINE,Why don't I give you my phone number?
S09E10,[Setting,Coffee Shop]
S09E10,GEORGE,Hey.
S09E10,JERRY,Hey! How'd it go with the cocktail franks?
S09E10,GEORGE,Great! I ate the entire platter! Had to call in sick today.
S09E10,JERRY,Didn't you call in sick yesterday?
S09E10,GEORGE,"Hey, I work for Kruger Industrial Smoothing ""We don't care, and it shows."""
S09E10,JERRY,(Notices George brought hhis mail) You're gonna open your mail here?
S09E10,GEORGE,"Hey, at least I'm bringing something to this. (Starts flipping through envelopes, reads one ) ""Have you seen me?"" (Flicks it aside) Nope. (looks at next envelope) Woah, something from Whatley."
S09E10,JERRY,"See? You give, and you get."
S09E10,GEORGE,"(Reading the card from Whatley) ""This holiday season a donation has been made in your name to the Children's Alliance.""?"
S09E10,JERRY,"Oh, that's nice."
S09E10,GEORGE,"I got him Yankee's tickets! He got me a piece of paper saying ""I've given your gift to someone else!"""
S09E10,JERRY,To a children's charity!
S09E10,GEORGE,Don't you see how wrong that is?! Where's your Christmas spirit? And eye for an eye!
S09E10,ELAINE,Hey!
S09E10,JERRY,Hey.
S09E10,ELAINE,"(To waitress) Oh, nothing for me. (Waitress leaves) I'm going to ""Atomic Sub"" later."
S09E10,JERRY,"""Atomic Sub""? Why are you eating there?"
S09E10,ELAINE,"I got a card, and they stamp it every time I buy a sub. 24 stamps, and I become a submarine (makes a gesture) captain."
S09E10,JERRY,What does that mean?
S09E10,ELAINE,(Embarrassed) Free sub.
S09E10,ELAINE,What?
S09E10,GEORGE,Nothing. It's a card from my dad.
S09E10,ELAINE,"What is it? (Grabs the card from George, he tries to stop her, but fails. She reads it out loud.) ""Dear son, Happy Festivus."" What is Festivus?"
S09E10,GEORGE,"It's nothing, stop it.."
S09E10,JERRY,When George was growing up..
S09E10,GEORGE,"(Interrupting) Jerry, No!"
S09E10,JERRY,His father..
S09E10,GEORGE,No!
S09E10,JERRY,"Hated all the commercial and religious aspects of Christmas, so he made up his own holiday."
S09E10,ELAINE,Ohhhh.. and another piece of the puzzle falls into place.
S09E10,GEORGE,(pleading) Alright..
S09E10,JERRY,"And instead of a tree, didn't your father put up an aluminum pole?"
S09E10,GEORGE,Jerry! Stop it!
S09E10,JERRY,And weren't there a feats of strength that always ended up with you crying?
S09E10,GEORGE,"I can't take it anymore! I'm going to work! ARe you happy now?! (Gathers his things, and runs out of the coffee shop. Elaine and Jerry laugh hysterically)"
S09E10,[Setting,Jerry's apartment]
S09E10,ELAINE,"Oh, I can't believe it! I've lost my ""Atomic Sub"" card!.. Oh no! I bet I wrote that fake number on the back of it when I gave it to denim vest!"
S09E10,JERRY,So?
S09E10,ELAINE,"I've eaten 23 bad subs, I just need 1 more! It's like a long, bad movie, but you want to see the end of it!"
S09E10,JERRY,"No, you walk out."
S09E10,ELAINE,"Alright, then, it's like a boring book, but you gotta finish it."
S09E10,JERRY,"No, you wait for the movie!"
S09E10,ELAINE,"(Irritated, and through clinched teeth) I want that free sub."
S09E10,JERRY,"You don't need the card. High-end hoagie outfit like that, it's all computerized! (Snaps) They're cloning sheep now."
S09E10,KRAMER,"(Correcting) No, they're not cloning sheep. It's the same sheep! I saw Harry Blackstone do that trick with two goats and a handkerchief on the old Dean Martin show!"
S09E10,JERRY,"So, why don't you just try your blow-off number and see if he's called it?"
S09E10,ELAINE,That's a good idea.
S09E10,KRAMER,"(Answering phone) Yeah, Go! Wha.. really? Yeah, ok. Yeah! Bye. (Hangs up) Great news! Yeah, the strike has been settled. I'm going back to work."
S09E10,JERRY,What strike?
S09E10,KRAMER,"Yeah, H&H Bagels. That's where I worked."
S09E10,JERRY,You?
S09E10,ELAINE,Worked?
S09E10,JERRY,Bagels?
S09E10,KRAMER,"Yeah. Look, see. I still have my business card. (Pulls it out, hands it to Elaine) Yeah, we've been on strike for 12 years."
S09E10,ELAINE,"Oh, I remember seeing those guys picketing out there, but I haven't seen them in a long time."
S09E10,KRAMER,"Yeah, well, H&H wouldn't let us use their bath room while we were picketing. It put a cramp on our solidarity."
S09E10,ELAINE,What were your.. demands?
S09E10,KRAMER,"Yeah, 5.35 an hour. And that's what they're paying now."
S09E10,ELAINE,I believe that's the new minimum wage.
S09E10,KRAMER,"Now you know who to thank for that!.. Alright, I've got to go. (Heads for the door)"
S09E10,JERRY,Why didn't you ever mention this?
S09E10,KRAMER,"Jerry, I didn't want you to know I was out of work. It's embarrassing! (Leaves) (Scene ends)"
S09E10,[Setting,H&H Bagel Shop]
S09E10,KRAMER,"All right, everybody! I'm back!"
S09E10,MANAGER,Who are you?
S09E10,KRAMER,Cosmo Kramer.. strikes over.
S09E10,MANAGER,Oh yeah! Kramer.
S09E10,KRAMER,Huh.. wha- Didn't any of the guys come back?
S09E10,MANAGER,"NO, I""m sure they all got jobs.. like, ten years ago."
S09E10,KRAMER,"Oh, man. Makes you wonder what it was all for.."
S09E10,MANAGER,I could use someone for the holidays..
S09E10,KRAMER,"Alright! Toss me an apron, let's bagel! (Takes off his coat, puts it in the display case, then turns to see a plate full of bagels.) What are those?"
S09E10,MANAGER,Those are rasin bagels.
S09E10,KRAMER,"(Picks one up, he's mesmerized) I never thought I'd live to see that.."
S09E10,[Setting,Horse Track Betting]
S09E10,ELAINE,"So, anyway, I've been giving out your number as my standard fake."
S09E10,BOOKIE,So. You're Elaine Benes. We've been getting calls fro you for 5 years.
S09E10,ELAINE,"So, listen, when this guy calls, if you could just give him my real number.."
S09E10,BOOKIE,"(Interrupting) Hey, Charlie! Guess who's here. Elaine Benes."
S09E10,CHARLIE,Elaine Benes?!

S09E10,GEORGE,"So, attractive one day - not attractive the next?"
S09E10,JERRY,Have you come across this?
S09E10,GEORGE,"Yes, I am familiar with this syndrome -- she's a two-face."
S09E10,JERRY,(Relating) Like the Batman villain?
S09E10,GEORGE,(Annoyed) If that helps you..
S09E10,JERRY,"So, if I ask her out again - I don't know who's showing up The good, the bad, or the ugly."
S09E10,GEORGE,(Identifying what Jerry said) Clint Eastwood!
S09E10,JERRY,Yeah.
S09E10,GEORGE,"Hey, check this out. I gotta give out Christmas presents to everyone down at Kruger, so I'm pulling a Whatley. (Give a Christmas card to Jerry)"
S09E10,JERRY,"(Reading it) ""A donation has been made in your name to the Human Fund."" - What is that?"

S09E10,JERRY,"(Continuing reading) ""The Human Fund. Money for people."""
S09E10,GEORGE,What do you think?
S09E10,JERRY,It has a certain understated stupidity.

S09E10,JERRY,..Yeah.
S09E10,KRAMER,"Ah, gentlemen.. bagels on the house!"
S09E10,JERRY,How was your first day?
S09E10,KRAMER,"Oh, fantastic! (Jerry and George both pick out a bagel) It felt so good to get my hands back in taht dough."
S09E10,JERRY,Your hands were in the dough?
S09E10,KRAMER,"No, I didn't make these bagels. (Jerry and George both take a bite) Yeah, they're day-olds. The homeless won't even touch them. (Jerry and George stop eating) Oh, we try to fool them by putting a few fresh ones on top, but they dig.. they, they test."
S09E10,GEORGE,"Alright. Uh, well, I'm out of here. (Gets up to leave)"
S09E10,JERRY,Happy Festivus!

S09E10,GEORGE,Stop it! It's nothing. It's a stupid holiday my father invented. It doesn't exist!
S09E10,ELAINE,"Happy Festivus, Georgie."
S09E10,KRAMER,Frank invented a holiday? He's so prolific!
S09E10,ELAINE,"Kramer, listen, I got a little phone relay going, so, if a guy calls H&H and he's looking for me, you take a message."
S09E10,JERRY,You're still trying to gget that free sub?
S09E10,ELAINE,"Hey! I have spent a lot of time, and I have eaten a lot of crap to get to where I am today. And I am NOT throwing it all away now."

S09E10,FRANK,"Many Christmases ago, I went to buy a doll for my son. I reach for the last one they had - but so did another man. As I rained blows opon him, I realized there had to be another way!"
S09E10,KRAMER,What happened to the doll?
S09E10,FRANK,"It was destroyed. But out of that, a new holiday was born. ""A Festivus for the rest of us!"""

S09E10,KRAMER,Is there a tree?
S09E10,FRANK,"No. Instead, there's a pole. It requires not decoration. I find tinsel distracting."
S09E10,KRAMER,"Frank, this new holiday of yours is scratching me right where I itch."

S09E10,GEORGE,"So, just bring her here. This is all you really need."
S09E10,JERRY,"I can't just keep bringing her to the coffee shop. I mean, what if things, you know, progress?"
S09E10,GEORGE,Lights out.
S09E10,JERRY,"Alright, I'll give it a shot! I do really like this coffee shop. Nice cuff links, by the way."

S09E10,GEORGE,What is that? Is taht the pole?!

S09E10,GEORGE,(Sulking) That's why I hate it.
S09E10,KRAMER,There's a big dinner Tuesday night at Frank's house - everyone's invited.
S09E10,FRANK,"George, you're forgetting how much Festivus has meant to us all. I brought one of the casette tapes. (Franks pushes play, George as a child celebrating Festivus is heard)"
S09E10,FRANK,Read that poem.

S09E11,GEORGE,"(Getting up, he addresses Jerry) All right, remember no rust-proofing. Commit to nothing. If you have to speak - mumble."
S09E11,JERRY,"(As George is leaving for the donuts) Au revoir, Le George."
S09E11,GEORGE,Dont think it cant happen! (Leaves)
S09E11,JERRY,"So, Puddy, this is a pretty good move for you, huh? No more ""grease monkey""."
S09E11,PUDDY,I dont care for that term.
S09E11,JERRY,"Oh. Sorry, I didnt know.."
S09E11,PUDDY,"No, I dont know too many monkeys who could take apart a fuel injector."
S09E11,JERRY,I saw one once that could do sign language.

S09E11,JERRY,No. We both just saw the same monkey.
S09E11,GEORGE,"(Aggravated) Well, I got screwed on the donuts. There were none left. Heh!"
S09E11,PUDDY,"(Standing up) Well, theres a vending machine. I could show you where it is. (Leaves, showing George the way)"

S09E11,GEORGE,(Talking it) Im here helpin you.
S09E11,ELAINE,Hey. Wheres Puddy? The copy machine is broken.
S09E11,GEORGE,"(On his way out) Heh, heh, heh. Thats what they want you to think."
S09E11,JERRY,"Hey, Elaine, have you noticed your boyfriend has developed an annoying little habit?"
S09E11,ELAINE,"(Squints, imitating Puddy) The squinting?"
S09E11,JERRY,No.
S09E11,ELAINE,"(Stares ahead, again, imitating Puddy) The staring?"
S09E11,JERRY,No. He keeps asking me to give him a high-five.
S09E11,ELAINE,(Shrugging) I thought all guys do that.
S09E11,JERRY,"Slapping hands is the lowest form of male primate ritual. In fact, even some of them have moved on - theyre doing sign language now."
S09E11,ELAINE,Its that bad?
S09E11,JERRY,What do you think the Nazis were doin? (Imitates the Nazis salute) That was the heil-five.
S09E11,ELAINE,"(Pointing out) Isnt that from your act, like, ten years ago?"
S09E11,JERRY,"(Slightly embarrassed) It was a good bit in the 80s, and its still relatable today."
S09E11,PUDDY,Good news. We got a 900 in black. Thats the hot color. (Holds up his hand) High-five.

S09E11,MECHANIC,(While walking away) Dont have one.
S09E11,GEORGE,"(Stopping him) Ah, excuse me. When your, uh, when your wallet was open, I - I glanced inside, and I couldnt help but notice that you have several crisp dollar bills."
S09E11,MECHANIC,(Calm) Youre incorrect.
S09E11,GEORGE,"(Persistent) Perhaps you could look again, please? Im very hungry."

S09E11,JERRY,"Either that, or theyve got a weird little hang-up about lying face-down in filth. Why dont you just go to the cashier?"
S09E11,GEORGE,The cashier is at lunch - which is where Id like to be.
S09E11,JERRY,How much was under there?
S09E11,GEORGE,(Looking at his finger) I think somethin bit me. I just need another nickel.
S09E11,JERRY,"(While fishing through his pocket for change) Hey, Puddy thinks I should go for the CD player. What do you think? (Hands him a nickel)"

I can see the crumb right there in the corner of your lip! Now, that-that-that is a cookie - and we all know that Twix is the only candy bar with the cookie crunch."

S09E11,KRAMER,"Yeah, yeah. (Getting out of the car) Well, Ill think about it.."
S09E11,RICK,Do you have my card?
S09E12,WAITRESS,"Careful, this plate is extremely hot."
S09E12,ELAINE,Thank you. Ow!
S09E12,WAITRESS,I just told you it was hot. Why'd you touch it?
S09E12,ELAINE,I just wanted to know what your idea of 'hot' is.
S09E12,PUDDY,"Hey, babe. You ready to hit the ice?"
S09E12,ELAINE,"I am ready to skate up a-- ha, ha, ha...Why are you wearing that?"
S09E12,PUDDY,It's my winter coat.
S09E12,ELAINE,A fur?
S09E12,PUDDY,Is there a problem?
S09E12,ELAINE,A seemingly infinite supply.
S09E12,ELAINE,"Ow! Careful, it's hot."
S09E12,PUDDY,Ow!
S09E12,JERRY,"So, Puddy wear's a man fur?"
S09E12,ELAINE,He was struttin' around the coffee shop like Stein Erickson.
S09E12,JERRY,"And, of course, you find fur morally reprehensible."
S09E12,ELAINE,"Eh, anti-fur. I mean, who has the energy anymore? This is more about hanging off the arm of an idiot."
S09E12,GEORGE,And this is the first you're seeing of the coat?
S09E12,ELAINE,We never dated in winter.
S09E12,JERRY,You might want to get a look at that bathing suit drawer.
S09E12,ELAINE,"Oh, I walked by Bloomingdale's the other day, and I saw that massage chair we want to get Joe Mayo as an apartment gift."
S09E12,GEORGE,"An apartment-warming gift? We got to give presents to people for moving? Birthdays, Christmas, it's enough gifts. I would like one month off."
S09E12,JERRY,Kramer said it's a perfect gift. That's what we're gettin' him.
S09E12,GEORGE,"All right, but we're not buyin' it at Bloomingdale's. I will buy it, you pay me back later. I'll sniff out a deal. I have a sixth sense."
S09E12,JERRY,Cheapness is not a sense.
S09E12,ELAINE,"I can't stand Joe Mayo's parties. You know, the second you walk in, he's got you workin' for him. 'Hey, can you do me a favor? Can you keep an eye on the ice, make sure we have enough?' Uh..."
S09E12,JERRY,I had a great time at the last one. I was in charge of the music. I turned that mother out.
S09E12,KRAMER,Hey.
S09E12,JERRY,Hey.
S09E12,KRAMER,You got any pliers?
S09E12,JERRY,"What, has Newman got another army man stuck in his ear?"
S09E12,NEWMAN,Hilarious.
S09E12,KRAMER,Newman and I are reversing the peepholes on our door. So you can see in.
S09E12,ELAINE,Why?
S09E12,NEWMAN,To prevent an ambush.
S09E12,KRAMER,"Yeah, so now I can peek to see if anyone is waiting to jack me with a sock full of pennies."
S09E12,JERRY,But then anyone can just look in and see you.
S09E12,KRAMER,"Our policy is, we're comfortable with our bodies. You know, if someone wants to help themselves to an eyefull, well, we say, 'Enjoy the show.'"
S09E12,ELAINE,I'm sorry I can't stay for the... second act.
S09E12,JERRY,"Hey, George. Here's the model number on that chair, by the way."
S09E12,KRAMER,Mmm... Nice wallet.
S09E12,NEWMAN,Wallet.
S09E12,JERRY,What?
S09E12,KRAMER,"Nobody carries wallets anymore. I mean, they went out with powdered wigs. Yeah, see here's what you need. Just a couple of cards and your bankroll. See, keep the big bills on the outside."
S09E12,JERRY,That's a five.
S09E12,KRAMER,"I'm on the Mexican, whoa ohh, radio..."
S09E12,SILVIO,"Eh, what are you doing?"
S09E12,KRAMER,"Hey, Silvio. Yeah, I'm reversing my peephole."
S09E12,SILVIO,"Hey, you know you gotta get permission from me. I'm the super. Who said you could do that?"
S09E12,KRAMER,"Well, who says I can do any of the things I do in my place?"
S09E12,SILVIO,Like what?
S09E12,KRAMER,"Well, I... uh, nothing. No, I'll, um, I'll switch it back."
S09E12,SILVIO,"No, no, no, no. No, that's all right."
S09E12,KRAMER,"Well, that's good. Because, uh, Newman and I--"
S09E12,SILVIO,"Newman? He did this, too?"
S09E12,KRAMER,"Well, yeah."
S09E12,SILVIO,I deal with him.
S09E12,GEORGE,"Hey, look at this. This is the same massage chair we're gettin' for Joe Mayo, $60 cheaper."
S09E12,JERRY,Except the store's in Delaware.
S09E12,GEORGE,I'll have 'em overnight it.
S09E12,JERRY,Maybe cheapness is a sense. You know it is better without this big wallet. It's more comfortable.
S09E12,GEORGE,It doesn't matter if it's more comfortable. It's wrong.
S09E12,JERRY,Why?
S09E12,GEORGE,"Because important things go in a case. You got a skull for your brain, a plastic sleeve for your comb, and a wallet for your money."
S09E12,JERRY,But look at this thing. It's-it's huge. You got more cow here than here.
S09E12,GEORGE,I need everything in there.
S09E12,JERRY,Irish money?
S09E12,GEORGE,I might go there.
S09E12,JERRY,Show this card at any participating Orlando-area Exxon station...to get your free 'Save the Tiger' poster.
S09E12,GEORGE,"All right, just gimme that. And gimme some of those Sweet & Lows."
S09E12,KRAMER,Who is it?
S09E12,NEWMAN,It's Newman.
S09E12,KRAMER,What do you want? I'm in the middle of something.
S09E12,NEWMAN,I can't believe I'm being evicted.
S09E12,KRAMER,What? What are you talking about?
S09E12,NEWMAN,The reverse peepholes. Silvio said I'm an agitator and I'm out of the building.
S09E12,KRAMER,"No. No, he can't do that."
S09E12,NEWMAN,"I'm homeless! I'm gonna be out on a street corner, dancing for nickels. I'll be with the hobos in the trainyard, eating out of a bucket."
S09E12,KRAMER,"Come on, we'll go and talk to him, and we'll straighten this thing out."
S09E12,NEWMAN,"Uh, you, uh, you better put something on."
S09E12,JERRY,"George, I am loving this no wallet thing."
S09E12,GEORGE,A man carries a wallet.
S09E12,JERRY,"You know, the very fact that you oppose this makes me think I'm onto something."
S09E12,JOY MAYO,"Hey, Jerry."
S09E12,JERRY,"Hey, Joe Mayo. Nice place."
S09E12,JOY MAYO,"Thanks. George, can you do me a favor and stay by the phone in case anybody calls and needs directions?"
S09E12,GEORGE,Love to.
S09E12,JOY MAYO,Thanks. Jerry...
S09E12,JERRY,Music?
S09E12,JOY MAYO,"Actually, can you keep an eye on the aquarium and make sure nobody taps on the glass?"
S09E12,JERRY,But I could do that and the music.
S09E12,JOY MAYO,"Oh, no, don't worry about the music. Just... have fun!"
S09E12,JERRY,I was ready to get jiggy with it.
S09E12,PUDDY,Hey.
S09E12,JERRY,"Hey, Elaine."
S09E12,ELAINE,Hey. I think you know Dr... Zaius.
S09E12,JERRY,"So, Elaine, notice anything different about my... pants?"
S09E12,ELAINE,"So, George... did you get the chair?"
S09E12,GEORGE,"No, I don't have it yet."
S09E12,JERRY,"So, we're givin' him nothing?"
S09E12,GEORGE,"No, I brought a picture of the chair."
S09E12,JERRY,Did you at least get him a card?
S09E12,GEORGE,I thought we'd all sign the picture.
S09E12,JOY MAYO,Elaine...
S09E12,ELAINE,"Hey, Joe Mayo."
S09E12,JOY MAYO,I need you to be in charge of coats.
S09E12,ELAINE,"Oh, fantastic."
S09E12,JOY MAYO,"And Puddy, can you make sure no one puts a drink on my...sound system?"
S09E12,PUDDY,"Sure thing, Joe Mayo."
S09E12,JERRY,"Hi, I'm Jerry. How do you like my pants?"
S09E12,KERI,Nice.
S09E12,JERRY,"(talking to George) It's working. (to the girl, who's tapping on the aquarium) Don't tap on the glass."
S09E12,GEORGE,(answering the phone while walking away) Joe Mayo's apartment?
S09E12,PUDDY,(standing guard by the stereo as George walks by him) Hey! Cocktail off the speaker.
S09E12,ELAINE,"Goodbye, Dr. Zaius."
S09E12,SILVIO,Why are we in Jerry's apartment?
S09E12,KRAMER,"Well, I, uh, I like to think of this as my conference room. Yeah, it has a more formal atmosphere, you know, with the shelves, and the furniture."
S09E12,SILVIO,"Make it quick Kramer, my wife and I are about to go bowling."
S09E12,KRAMER,"Oh, well, um, Newman thinks that you, uh, evicted him?"
S09E12,SILVIO,I did. I don't like Mr. Newman. He is an agitator.
S09E12,KRAMER,"Look... I've known Newman all my life, in the building, and you're all wrong about him. He's a model tenant. Portly, yes, but smart as a whip."
S09E12,SILVIO,"OK, on your word he can stay."
S09E12,KRAMER,All right.
S09E12,SILVIO,But... I'm gonna keep my eye on him.
S09E12,KRAMER,"Well, you won't regret it."
S09E12,SILVIO,What's wrong?
S09E12,JOY MAYO,"Elaine, thanks for coming."
S09E12,ELAINE,Good working with you.
S09E12,PUDDY,"All right, let's hit the bricks."
S09E12,ELAINE,What?
S09E12,JOY MAYO,"Hey, I got a coat just like this!"
S09E12,ELAINE,Oh. Uhhh...
S09E12,ELAINE,So Joe Mayo had the same coat.
S09E12,GEORGE,And you threw it out the window?
S09E12,ELAINE,Mm-hmm.
S09E12,GEORGE,"God, you're like a rock star."
S09E12,ELAINE,So now Joe Mayo wants me to buy him a new coat.
S09E12,JERRY,Because you threw it out.
S09E12,ELAINE,"No, because I was in charge of the coats. It's... insane."
S09E12,JERRY,But you did actually throw his coat out the window.
S09E12,ELAINE,"But he doesn't know that. As far as he knows, somebody stole it, and that's the person who should be responsible."
S09E12,JERRY,But that's you.
S09E12,ELAINE,"So I guess I'll have to buy him a new coat, even though I don't think I should be held responsible, which I am anyway."
S09E12,GEORGE,"Well, I'm satisfied. Uh...my back is...killing me."
S09E12,JERRY,Of course. Because of that wallet. You-you got a filing cabinet under half of your ass.
S09E12,GEORGE,"This...is an organizer, a secretary, and a friend."
S09E12,ELAINE,Look at you. You're on a slant.
S09E12,GEORGE,"Here, just give me a couple of napkins."
S09E12,GEORGE,"There, there I'm fine."
S09E12,JERRY,What was that?
S09E12,GEORGE,I think I had some hard candy in there.
S09E12,GEORGE,"No, no, this is supposed to go to Joe Mayo's apartment."
S09E12,GEORGE,Ahhh. How does this thing work?
S09E12,GEORGE,Ahhhhh...
S09E12,DELIVERY MAN,"Sir, do you want me to deliver this to your friend's place or not?"
S09E12,GEORGE,Ahhhhh...
S09E12,KERI,Ready to go?
S09E12,JERRY,All set. I can't believe I'm going dancing.
S09E12,KERI,You don't go that often?
S09E12,JERRY,"No, because it's so stupid. Shall we?"
S09E12,KERI,Do me a favor. Can you hold this stuff for me?
S09E12,JERRY,"Compact, lipstick, all this?"
S09E12,KERI,And can you help to carry my keys?
S09E12,JERRY,"What are you, a medieval dungeon master?"
S09E12,KERI,And a tin of altoids.
S09E12,JERRY,Ow! Sharp key.
S09E12,KRAMER,"So, you're sleeping with Silvio's wife?"
S09E12,NEWMAN,"Well, there's very little sleeping going on."
S09E12,KRAMER,"Well, why didn't you tell me about this?"
S09E12,NEWMAN,"Quite frankly, I don't see how it's any of your business."
S09E12,KRAMER,"Well, it's my business now. Look, I stuck up for you. Man, if he catches you, we're both out."
S09E12,NEWMAN,"Hey, what is that up that tree?"
S09E12,KRAMER,"Hoooh! Man, that looks like a dead bear."
S09E12,NEWMAN,"No, that's a fur coat! Hey, uh, give me a boost."
S09E12,KRAMER,"Man, where did you learn to climb trees like that?"
S09E12,NEWMAN,The Pacific Northwest.
S09E12,ELAINE,"So, you had to carry some of Keri's stuff. Big deal."
S09E12,JERRY,"You don't understand. I went on a successful pocket diet, and I want to keep that weight off."
S09E12,ELAINE,You know what? We sell this thing at Peterman that would be perfect for you.
S09E12,JERRY,Not more of that crap from the Titanic?
S09E12,ELAINE,No. No. It's a small men's carryall.
S09E12,JERRY,I'm not carrying a purse.
S09E12,ELAINE,It's not a purse. It's European.
S09E12,JERRY,Oh.
S09E12,ELAINE,"Hey, did George buy Joe Mayo that chair yet?"
S09E12,JERRY,I don't know.
S09E12,ELAINE,"If I'm gettin' him a new fur, I'm not chippin' in on a gift, too."
S09E12,GEORGE,Yeah?
S09E12,JERRY,"Hey, George, did you get Joe Mayo that chair yet?"
S09E12,GEORGE,Not yet. Oh! Ho ho! God...
S09E12,JERRY,What?
S09E12,GEORGE,It's in... transit.
S09E12,ELAINE,Did he get it?
S09E12,JERRY,No.
S09E12,ELAINE,"Mmm, good. Tell him I'm out."
S09E12,GEORGE,"(hearing Elaine over the phone) What, she's out?"
S09E12,JERRY,"Well, so what? You're gettin' a deal, right? We'll split it three ways."
S09E12,GEORGE,Allllll right!
S09E12,JERRY,What is that noise?
S09E12,GEORGE,(hangs up the phone) That's my toaster. I got to go. Ohhhhhhhhhhhhh!
S09E12,JERRY,"You know, sometimes I get the feeling George isn't being completely honest with me."
S09E12,KRAMER,"Hey. Oh, uh, yeah. Uh, here are your pliers back....Weak hinge."
S09E12,ELAINE,"Well, I guess I better go and price fur coats."
S09E12,KRAMER,"Oh, go down to 88th Street. They're free."
S09E12,ELAINE,What are you talking about?
S09E12,KRAMER,"Well, they're hanging from the trees. You know, Newman found one there yesterday. Man, that guy can climb like a ring-tailed lemur!"
S09E12,ELAINE,88th Street? That's where Joe Mayo lives. That's the coat!
S09E12,JERRY,What was that pop sound?
S09E12,KRAMER,"Well, I had some hard candy in there."
S09E12,NEWMAN,"So, to what do I owe this unusual invitation?"
S09E12,ELAINE,"Come in, come in."
S09E12,NEWMAN,"Ahh! This is very much as I imagined it to be. Aside from this rattan piece, which seems oddly out of place."
S09E12,ELAINE,"Please, sit down. Newman, um, I wanted to talk to you about something."
S09E12,NEWMAN,This isn't about my opening your mail?
S09E12,ELAINE,What?
S09E12,NEWMAN,"Because I don't, never have, anything I read was already open."
S09E12,ELAINE,"Uh, yeah, uh, no. Newman, uh, I heard that you found a fur coat in a tree. And, I believe that it belongs to a friend of mine, and I'd like to give it back to him."
S09E12,NEWMAN,"Sorry. Climbers, keepers."
S09E12,ELAINE,"You know, Newmie. Um, I know how you feel about me, and I have to tell you, I'm quite flattered."
S09E12,NEWMAN,You are?
S09E12,ELAINE,"Oh, yeah. I mean, of all the men that I know, you're the only one who's held down a steady job for several years."
S09E12,NEWMAN,"Well, it's-it's interesting work, I don't mind it."
S09E12,ELAINE,Ha ha ha ha.
S09E12,NEWMAN,"Don't you have a-a boyfriend? A, uh, burly, athletic type?"
S09E12,ELAINE,"Uh, don't worry, he's cool."
S09E12,NEWMAN,Cool?
S09E12,ELAINE,"Very cool. So, what do you say? Can you do this one little favor, Newmie?"
S09E12,NEWMAN,"Oh, how I've waited for this moment. But alas, my heart belongs to another man's wife, and I have given the coat to her."
S09E12,ELAINE,"All right, we're done here."
S09E12,NEWMAN,"For I am in love with Svetlana, and I don't care if the whole world knows, except for Silvio, who would throw me out of the apartment, where I would be dancing on the sidewalk--"
S09E12,ELAINE,"Thank you, thank you, thank you very much."
S09E12,KERI,Nice carryall.
S09E12,JERRY,It's European.
S09E12,KERI,Do you still have my lipstick?
S09E12,JERRY,"Uh, yeah, I think I do. I can never find anything in here. Ah, here it is. So, that Joe Mayo throws the worst parties, doesn't he? So what was your job?"
S09E12,KERI,My job was to keep you away from the music.
S09E12,JERRY,"What, he doesn't like my taste in music?"
S09E12,KERI,Guess not.
S09E12,JERRY,You should've been there last year. I got jiggy with it!
S09E12,SILVIO,"Kramer! It's Silvio! Open up, I need to talk to you! I can see you through the reverse peephole."
S09E12,KRAMER,"Hey, Silvio!"
S09E12,SILVIO,Look at this.
S09E12,KRAMER,Huh?
S09E12,SILVIO,"Svetlana says she find it in the laundry room, but I think it is a gift from that postman agitator. Where is he?"
S09E12,KRAMER,"Relax, Silvio."
S09E12,SILVIO,"No, that's it. You're both out of the building!"
S09E12,KRAMER,"Oh, come on! Hey, Newman didn't even give her that! No, that's not even a woman's coat. It's a man's!"
S09E12,SILVIO,A man's?
S09E12,KRAMER,Yeah.
S09E12,SILVIO,What kind of a man would wear fur?
S09E12,KRAMER,"Oh, lots of 'em."
S09E12,SILVIO,Would you?
S09E12,KRAMER,No.
S09E12,SILVIO,Then who?
S09E12,KRAMER,What about Jerry?
S09E12,SILVIO,Jerry?
S09E12,KRAMER,"Yeah, sure, he's a celebrity. Oh, yeah, they wear a lot of furs. They're desperate, insecure people."
S09E12,SILVIO,"Yes, you are right. It's all about, me, me, me. Please, look at me! I am so pretty! Love me! Want me!"
S09E12,KRAMER,"Yeah, something like that."
S09E12,JERRY,I have to do what?
S09E12,KRAMER,All you have to do is wear the fur so Silvio thinks it's yours.
S09E12,JERRY,I'm not wearing the fur.
S09E12,KRAMER,"Well, then, Newman and I, we get thrown out of the building."
S09E12,JERRY,Is that right?
S09E12,KRAMER,"All right, why don't you just take a good, hard look at what your life will be like if I'm not around?"
S09E12,JERRY,"Newman, too?"
S09E12,KRAMER,"Oh, come on, man! Well, I'll tell you what, if you do this, I'll give you that walkman you're always asking about."
S09E12,JERRY,That's my walkman!
S09E12,KRAMER,And you'll get it back.
S09E12,JERRY,All right.
S09E12,KRAMER,"All right. Good, thanks, I owe you one."
S09E12,GEORGE,Hey.
S09E12,KRAMER,"Oh, hey, and by the way, uh, that walkman was broke when you gave it to me."
S09E12,JERRY,"George, did you get that chair yet?"
S09E12,GEORGE,It gets here when it gets here. Would you stop ridin' me?
S09E12,JERRY,You know what? Just call up and cancel it. I'm out.
S09E12,GEORGE,Excuse me?
S09E12,JERRY,Joe Mayo doesn't like my taste in music. He's not gettin' a gift from me.
S09E12,GEORGE,"Oh, I can't believe you're dropping out, too. So now Kramer and I have to pay for the entire gift?"
S09E12,KRAMER,"Whoa, whoa. Now, who's this Joe Mayo everyone's talking about?"
S09E12,GEORGE,"He's the guy we're the buying the chair for, remember? It was your suggestion."
S09E12,KRAMER,"I think the chair is a fantastic gift idea. But I never heard of this Joe Mayo. And frankly, it sounds made up."
S09E12,GEORGE,"Oh, so now I have to buy this whole chair by myself?"
S09E12,JERRY,"No, you don't have to buy anything."
S09E12,GEORGE,"I already bought it! I've been lyin' to you for three days, and now you're all screwin' me!"
S09E12,JERRY,I don't understand. Why didn't you tell us you had it?
S09E12,GEORGE,I needed it! My back is... a little tweaked.
S09E12,JERRY,Because of your giant wallet. Just get rid of it!
S09E12,GEORGE,"Never! It is a part of me. I will just return the chair, and it will be easy, because the receipt is in my good friend."
S09E12,JERRY,Your good friend is morbidly obese.
S09E12,GEORGE,"Well, at least, I'm not carrying a purse."
S09E12,JERRY,It's not a purse. It's European!
S09E12,KRAMER,"All right, Silvio's down there. He's shoveling the walk. Now, all you gotta do is put this on, you go down to the corner, you pick up a paper, and you come right back."
S09E12,JERRY,All right.
S09E12,KRAMER,There you go.
S09E12,JERRY,How do I look?
S09E12,KRAMER,Ahh....
S09E12,GEORGE,"Learn guitar, first lesson free? Huh."
S09E12,GEORGE,My receipts! The chair! My tiger poster!
S09E12,JERRY,"Hey, Silvio, just out for a little stroll in my favorite fur coat."
S09E12,SILVIO,That is your coat?
S09E12,JERRY,It sure is.
S09E12,SILVIO,Kramer says you need it because you're an entertainer and you're desperate for attention.
S09E12,JERRY,That's true.
S09E12,KRAMER,"Jerry, you forgot your purse."
S09E12,JERRY,"Oh, thanks."
S09E12,KRAMER,"Hey, Silvio, look at Jerry here, prancing around in his coat with his purse. Yup, he's a dandy. He's a real fancy boy."
S09E12,JERRY,Maybe this isn't my coat.
S09E12,KRAMER,"All right, you're not fancy!"
S09E12,SILVIO,"No, he's very fancy! Want me, love me! Shower me with kisses!"
S09E12,ELAINE,"Jerry, where'd you get it? That's his coat."
S09E12,JERRY,"No, it's not. It's mine. I'm a fancy boy."
S09E12,ELAINE,"No, that's not your coat."
S09E12,SILVIO,"If that is not his coat, whose coat is it?"
S09E12,ELAINE,It's Joe Mayo's coat.
S09E12,SILVIO,Who's Joe Mayo?
S09E12,KRAMER,That must be the man that's sleeping with your wife.
S09E12,JERRY,Hey! Officer! Someone took my European carryall!
S09E12,COP,Your what?
S09E12,JERRY,"The...black, leather...thing with a strap."
S09E12,COP,You mean a purse?
S09E12,JERRY,"Yes, a purse. I carry a purse!"
S09E12,JERRY,"So, Silvio ambushed Joe Mayo?"
S09E12,ELAINE,"Yeah, he was waitin' inside his apartment for him with a sock full of pennies."
S09E12,JERRY,He should have had a reverse peephole.
S09E12,PUDDY,"Hey, Babe."
S09E12,JERRY,Hello? Hello?
S09E12,ELAINE,What is that?
S09E12,PUDDY,It's my new coat.
S09E12,ELAINE,You ditched the fur?
S09E12,PUDDY,"Yeah, I saw Jerry wearing his. He looked like a bit of a dandy. Check it out! 8-Ball! You got a question, you ask the 8-Ball."
S09E12,ELAINE,You're gonna wear this all the time?
S09E12,PUDDY,All signs point to 'Yes!'
S09E13,JERRY,So your saying UNICEF is a scam?
S09E13,KRAMER,It's the perfect cover for a money laundering operation . No one can keep track of all those kids with the little orange boxes of change.
S09E13,JERRY,Oh! No it's Sally Weaver.
S09E13,KRAMER,Oh! Yeah your old college roommate huh?
S09E13,JERRY,"No, It's Susan Ross's old college roommate; she moved to New York a few years ago . she's trying to become an actress."
S09E13,KRAMER,"Hmmm,, Dramatica comedia heh!"
S09E13,JERRY,"Untalented, She's always inviting me to see her in some bad play in tiny room without ventilation. It's really depressing."
S09E13,KRAMER,Euh.. We don't go to enough theater.
S09E13,JERRY,She should just give up.
S09E13,JERRY,Heeyyy!...
S09E13,SALLY,Hey there Mr. Too big to come to my shows. I just came back from (?) Whoooooooo.....I'm on my way to an audition still waiting for that big break.
S09E13,KRAMER,Why don't you just give up?
S09E13,JERRY,Kramer!!!
S09E13,KRAMER,"At least that's what Jerry says. Now face it. If it hasn't happen it's not gonna happen. All right, we go grab some bouffe . Join us?"
S09E13,JERRY,So......Susan's dead.....
S09E13,KRAMER,I think she was happy someone finally said it.
S09E13,JERRY,Why'd you have to say anything to her?
S09E13,KRAMER,'felt that the conversation was lagging.
S09E13,JERRY,Why can't you ever keep your big mouth shut?
S09E13,KRAMER,I come in here to get a pleasant meal and if we're not gonna have one I'll grab a bite to eat at your place.
S09E13,ELAINE,"You know, maybe Kramer is right, some people should just give up . I have."
S09E13,JERRY,What did you wanna be?
S09E13,ELAINE,"I don't remember, but it certainly wasn't this. Look at this cartoon in the New Yorker, I don't get this."
S09E13,JERRY,I don't either.
S09E13,ELAINE,And you're on the fringe of the humor business.
S09E13,GEORGE,Hey!
S09E13,ELAINE,Hey! George look at this.
S09E13,GEORGE,That's cute.
S09E13,ELAINE,You got it?
S09E13,GEORGE,"No, never mind."
S09E13,ELAINE,"Come on, We're two intelligent people here. We can figure this out. Now we got a dog and a cat in an office."
S09E13,JERRY,It looks like my accountant's office but there's no pets working there.
S09E13,ELAINE,"The cat is saying "" I've enjoyed reading your E-mail""."
S09E13,GEORGE,Maybe it's got something to do with that 42 in the corner .
S09E13,ELAINE,It's a page number.
S09E13,GEORGE,"Well, I can't crack this one."
S09E13,ELAINE,Aahh! this has got to be a mistake.
S09E13,GEORGE,"try shaking it...(long pause) Well,Janet should be here any minute."
S09E13,JERRY,You've been hiding her from us. you must really like her?
S09E13,GEORGE,"Aah! the minute I saw this girl, we just clicked. She's got such a nice face. hummmm her eyes, her mouth, nose"
S09E13,ELAINE,We know what a face consists of.
S09E13,JANET,I'm sorry I'm late.
S09E13,GEORGE,"Jerry, Elaine, I give you.. Janet."
S09E13,JANET,Nice to meet you.
S09E13,ELAINE,Hi!
S09E13,JANET,Do we still have time to make the movie?
S09E13,GEORGE,Oh! euh.. Yeah We just can't go to the supermarket to get some candy.
S09E13,ELAINE,"Jerry, She looks exactly like you."
S09E13,JERRY,She does not.
S09E13,ELAINE,"Well maybe she doesn't, I don't care."
S09E13,JERRY,Hey! Kramer.
S09E13,KRAMER,"hey! you got some messages.. Yeahumm.. .George, George, Elaine, George again, Elaine, Newman; but that was a crank call. and some Sally woman called said ""Thanks a lot, she's quitting the business, you ruined her life."
S09E13,JERRY,What! You're the one who ruined her life.
S09E13,KRAMER,Well that's not how she remembers it.
S09E13,JERRY,"Well, I got to talk her out of this."
S09E13,KRAMER,I thought you said she stinks
S09E13,JERRY,She does stink and she should quit. But I don't want it to be because of me. It should be the traditional route; years of rejections and failures till she's spit out the bottom of the porn industry.
S09E13,JERRY,Yeah...
S09E13,GEORGE,Hey! George and Janet.
S09E13,KRAMER,Aahh...Who's Janet?
S09E13,JERRY,"George's girlfriend, Elaine thinks she looks like me but I think it's as you would say,kookie talk."
S09E13,KRAMER,You know what woman I always thought you looked like; Leena Horne.
S09E13,ALL,"Hey, Hey!"
S09E13,KRAMER,And you must....look exactly like Jerry. You don't see this; you're like twins .. WOoooohhhhh!!! this is eerie.
S09E13,GEORGE,"Kramer, what are you talking about...Janet doesn't look anything like Jerry"
S09E13,JANET,well maybe we do look a little like each other.
S09E13,GEORGE,"No..hummm, What do you know about what you look like."
S09E13,KRAMER,C'mon George relax . Just because they look alike doesn't mean you're secretly in love with Jerry.
S09E13,GEORGE,(nervous) All right now we're going bye bye.
S09E13,JANET,We just got here George
S09E13,GEORGE,"Well,,, it's getting dark."
S09E13,KRAMER,"yeah, she's a nice girl, kinda quiet though."
S09E13,JERRY,What are you doing? Don't tell a woman she looks like a man and George doesn't want to hear his girlfriend looks like me and frankly neither do I
S09E13,KRAMER,"Well how should I have ""broached the subject"""
S09E13,JERRY,"You don't broach, you keep your mouth shut."
S09E13,KRAMER,Well sounds like someone's having a bad day.
S09E13,JERRY,Yeah! Because of you.
S09E13,KRAMER,"Well, I think one of us should leave."
S09E13,JERRY,"Sally, you can't quit the business. This is all because of me."
S09E13,SALLY,(nods) Hehumm!!
S09E13,JERRY,"You can't give up. You don't think people tell me I stink? When I'm on stage that's all I hear; You stink, You suck. We like magic."
S09E13,SALLY,Really?
S09E13,JERRY,"Of course, I stink, you stink. It's show bizz. everybody stinks.."
S09E13,SALLY,Yeah! You've been stinking since the Eighties.
S09E13,JERRY,"All right, I think we've covered my act. Now you get out there and stink it up with everybody else."
S09E13,SALLY,"Right!, Yesss!! Thank you I'm gonna do it. (starts to eat her food)"
S09E13,JERRY,NOW!!!!.... (she leaves in a hurry)
S09E13,ELAINE,"Well I've asked every one at work and nobody gets this cartoon. I mean I don't understand why no one can explain it, but I'm gonna get to the bottom of this."
S09E13,JERRY,Oh! I think we're at the bottom.
S09E13,ELAINE,"(to George who just came in) Hey! George, Janet looks very nice and she's quite a handsome woman."
S09E13,GEORGE,What does that mean?
S09E13,JERRY,Yeah. What does that mean?
S09E13,GEORGE,(to Jerry) What do you mean by that?
S09E13,ELAINE,Enjoy. (she leaves)
S09E13,JERRY,Elaine huh?.. She's completely..
S09E13,GEORGE,Oh! I know....'Cos you don't think Janet?..
S09E13,JERRY,No....
S09E13,GEORGE,Why would I...
S09E13,JERRY,It's ludicrous..
S09E13,GEORGE,Yes.
S09E13,JERRY,For either one of us..
S09E13,GEORGE,No...
S09E13,JERRY,So...
S09E13,GEORGE,Exactly.
S09E13,JERRY,I'm not gay.
S09E13,GEORGE,...neither am I.
S09E13,BOTH,"Kramer, Kramer, get in here."
S09E13,GEORGE,"Where's the crazy man, Come on up."
S09E13,JERRY,Come on in here.
S09E13,GEORGE,Haaaaaa!!!
S09E13,JERRY,"What's happening? What, you doing, come and talk to us."
S09E13,KRAMER,I've made an important life decision.
S09E13,JERRY,Lets talk about that.
S09E13,GEORGE,Don't leave (George slams the door)
S09E13,KRAMER,Aw right. I know I've been shooting off at the mouth lately; First with that girl whose life you destroyed and.. emm...about George dating a lady Jerry
S09E13,GEORGE,What's the decision?
S09E13,KRAMER,I know you want me to keep my big mouth shut and that's exactly what I'm going to do. I'm never gonna talk again.
S09E13,JERRY,Yeah right.
S09E13,KRAMER,"What do I need to talk for.. ha!, For to blab to the neighbors about George has a new fem-Jerry friend or to tell everybody at the coffee shop ho George is all mixed up in a perverse sexual amalgam of some girl and his best friend. See now, I've done all that.....Now it's time for silence."
S09E13,GEORGE,Silence YES!!
S09E13,JERRY,Kramer you're never gonna be able to completely stop talking.
S09E13,KRAMER,"Jerry, ninety four percent of communications is non-verbal. Here watch."
S09E13,JERRY,Well what does this mean?
S09E13,KRAMER,Well it's Frank and Estelle's reaction of hearing George's man love towards she-Jerry.
S09E13,GEORGE,"(frantic by now) SHUT UP,SHUT UP, SHUT UP,...(then leaves)"
S09E13,KRAMER,That's the idea.
S09E13,JERRY,Kramer there's no way you stick to this.
S09E13,KRAMER,(makes a zipper gesture to his mouth) ..Weeeeeepp!!
S09E13,JERRY,Oh! you just startin' now?
S09E13,KRAMER,that's right......Aye oooh!! ...Right now.
S09E13,KRAMER,Ouch!!..........Now!!
S09E13,MR. ELINOFF,"So, J. Peterman wants to hire some of our cartoonists to illustrate your catalog?"
S09E13,ELAINE,"Well we're hoping that if perhaps that the catalog is a little funnier,people won't be so quick to return the clothes ha ha....For example.. I..I really do....Well I love this one"
S09E13,MR. ELINOFF,Oh! yeah... That's a rather clever jab at inter office politics don't you think.
S09E13,ELAINE,"Ahan, Ahan....yeah...Euh but, Why is it that the, that the animals enjoy reading the email?"
S09E13,MR. ELINOFF,Well Miss Benes . Cartoons are like gossamer and one doesn't dissect gossamer. heh..hemm..
S09E13,ELAINE,Well you don't have to dissect if you can just tell me. Why this is suppose to be funny?
S09E13,MR. ELINOFF,Ha! It's merely a commentary on contemporary mores. (slides the magazine to her)
S09E13,ELAINE,"But, what is the comment. (she slides the magazine back to him)"
S09E13,MR. ELINOFF,It's a slice of life.
S09E13,ELAINE,No it isn't.
S09E13,MR. ELINOFF,Pun?
S09E13,ELAINE,"I don,t think so."
S09E13,MR. ELINOFF,Vorshtein?
S09E13,ELAINE,That's not a word.....You have no idea what this means do you?
S09E13,MR. ELINOFF,No.
S09E13,ELAINE,Then why did you print it.
S09E13,MR. ELINOFF,I liked the kitty.
S09E13,ELAINE,"(gets up) You know what? you people should be ashamed of yourself, you know ya doodle a couple of bears at a cocktail party talking about the stock market. You think you're doing comedy."
S09E13,MR. ELINOFF,Actually that's not bad..
S09E13,ELAINE,Oh! really (laughs) well you know..... I have others
S09E13,JERRY,"Sally, I can't believe you're already doing a One-woman show?"
S09E13,SALLY,"No, no.. It's just a little performance piece I wrote... You know what? You really inspired me,oKay, a tear."
S09E13,JERRY,Ah! There you are.(Kramer motions silence)
S09E13,JERRY,"Aw.. right, code of silence.. how's that going?....Ha!!..."
S09E13,SALLY,"Hi everybody think you're really going to like this 'cos it' about me...All right it's not just about me It's about me and this guy; Jerry Seinfeld. who I like to call; The Devil...Okay, Okay so.. I run into this Jerry on the street and he says to me "" Sally, You stink, You should give up acting."" Oh! I'm doing Jerry Now so you've got imagine I have ; horns, a tail and hooks instead of feet. (big laughs from the audience and Kramer is cracking up)"
S09E13,JERRY,(to Kramer) Oh! Shut up!!!
S09E13,ELAINE,She does a full hour about how you're the devil .I got to go see this thing.
S09E13,JERRY,"Good luck, It's sold out for the next three weeks."
S09E13,ELAINE,Well I bet I can get in once I mention I'm from ...The New Yorker.
S09E13,JERRY,The New Yorker?
S09E13,ELAINE,"Yes, The New Yorker, I've met with their cartoon editor and I got him to admit that that cartoon ...MADE NO SENSE...."
S09E13,JERRY,"Wow! Good work, Nancy Drew"
S09E13,ELAINE,Then we ended up going out to lunch and he had some great gossip about James Thurber.
S09E13,JERRY,Nodding off...
S09E13,ELAINE,....And he said I could submit some of my own cartoons.
S09E13,JERRY,Wow! that's incredible......But you don't draw.
S09E13,ELAINE,I do to.
S09E13,JERRY,"What, your sad little horsies, the house with the little curl of smoke, the sunflower with the smiley face. the transparent cube... (as she leaves)"
S09E13,ELAINE,It's better than your drawings of naked Lois Lane.
S09E13,JERRY,Where did you see that? Those are private!!!
S09E13,SALLY,"Jerry, sorry I'm late. Channel Nine is doing a piece on my show. Isn't that great? Do you hate me?"
S09E13,JERRY,"No,no I tought the show was terrific. I was just wondering if you have to keep saying Jerry Seinfeld is the devil."
S09E13,SALLY,Well...That is the title.
S09E13,JERRY,I know but I thought that maybe you could mention how I apologized then encouraged you to stick with it.
S09E13,SALLY,You know I workshopped that and.. SNOOZERS!!! he he he....but I'll tell you what I'll think... It's all a journey.
S09E13,JERRY,You got a little shmootz there (picks something on her sweater)
S09E13,NEWMAN,"Excuse me Miss Weaver, OH! My god it is you! I.. I've seen your show six times.."
S09E13,JERRY,What a surprise.
S09E13,NEWMAN,"Aahh! You're great,It's great, It's so great to see a show that's (looks at Jerry) about something."
S09E13,DRIVER,Where to?
S09E13,GEORGE,"(we hear him think) My friends are idiots, she doesn't look like Jerry. She doesn't look like anybody. And so what if does look like Jerry,what does that mean?. That I could have everything I have with Jerry but because it's a woman I could also have sex with her....And that somehow that would be exactly what I always wanted.....She doesn't even look like Jerry.."
S09E13,SALLY,You know I really do look like your friend Jerry.
S09E13,GEORGE,I know....
S09E13,TV ANNOUNCER,Thanks for watching Nine News. We leave you tonight with a scene from Sally Weavers One woman show.
S09E13,SALLY,"Ok so I go to meet Jerry Seinfeld at this horrible coffee shop right? And he's like ""Hey stop doing your show."" and I'm like, Hello! It's a free country. So then he goes."" Okay Shmootsie"" and he starts pulling at my sweater right?. He's getting, you know, Hands Across America."
S09E13,JERRY,There really was shmootz on I didn't try to grab her
S09E13,SALLY,...And this is what he looks like when he's eating...
S09E13,JERRY,Get Out of my House!!.
S09E13,ELAINE,"Well boys, I did it. I had to stay up all night but I finally came up with a great New Yorker cartoon."
S09E13,JERRY,I'd stayed up all night I'd fixed myself up a little before I'd go out.
S09E13,ELAINE,That is not the point.
S09E13,JERRY,"some mouthwash, a hat, something."
S09E13,ELAINE,Just read it!
S09E13,JERRY,(glances at it) Pretty good.
S09E13,ELAINE,Pretty good? Well uh! This is a gem . Kramer look it....(Kramer stays silent).....What? It's funny.
S09E13,JERRY,It's a pig at a complain department.
S09E13,ELAINE,"And he's saying "" I wish I was taller"" ha ha. See? that's his complaint."
S09E13,JERRY,I get it.
S09E13,ELAINE,Do you!!!.. because that's not a normal complaint.
S09E13,JERRY,"How 'bout if it was something like "" I can't find my receipt my place's a stye."
S09E13,ELAINE,Everything with you has to be so .. jokey.
S09E13,JERRY,I'm a comedian.
S09E13,ELAINE,"I wish I was taller, that's, that's, that's nice. that's real."
S09E13,JERRY,Well I got a complaint. This cartoon stinks.
S09E13,ELAINE,"I'll tell you who doesn't think it stinks, The New Yorker. that's right. They're publishing it in their next issue. Oh! you know what I just ran into Newman in the hall and he said you tried to grope Sally Weaver."
S09E13,JERRY,oh! that's it I'm gonna put an end to this.
S09E13,ELAINE,"The pig says ""my wife is a slut."""
S09E13,JERRY,"Now that's a complaint. ...Hello Sally, yeah this is Jerry,I just wanted to leave you a message that I caught your little piece on TV and.."
S09E13,JERRY,....I'm getting a little tired of hearing how horrible I am and would appreciate it if you would leave me out of your act all together.
S09E13,JERRY,"(from the back of the club, leaving) That's it I'm calling in the big guns."
S09E13,SALLY,"To cease and desist on behalf of my client, Jerry Seinfeld. Signed ; Crybaby Jerry Seinfeld's Lawyer. Ok but I got two words for you Jerry Seinfeld...(censored beep)...You"
S09E13,JERRY,How could she say that on TV?.. And how did she get a cable special . I 've never gotten a cable special.....well that's it I'm not giving her any more material. We are incommunicado. (to the silent Kramer on the couch beside him) ...Exactly.
S09E13,ELAINE,"Check it out, from the new issue of the New Yorker...huh!...Funny isn't it? (Dugan shrugs) Look at it, the pig wants to be taller and what's this guy gonna say?.. he he...Nothin'..he he."
S09E13,PETERMAN,"Elaine, I'm afraid I have incurred yet another flat tire."
S09E13,ELAINE,Can I fix that after lunch sir?
S09E13,PETERMAN,"Oh! no right away, chop, chop........Oh! a new cartoon.....""I wish I was taller (hearty laugh) I'd like to see that complaint get rectified. (more laughs and he leaves)"
S09E13,ELAINE,(to Dugan ) You see? You see? Smart people think this is funny and you want to know why? 'Cause I wrote it.
S09E13,DUGAN,You shouldn't make fun of pigs. (he leaves)
S09E13,PETERMAN,(returns) Flash of lightning Elaine I just realized why I like this cartoon so much.
S09E13,ELAINE,Oh! Do tell sir?
S09E13,PETERMAN,It's a Ziggy!
S09E13,ELAINE,A Ziggy?
S09E13,PETERMAN,"That irreverence, that wit I'd recognize it anywhere. Some charlatan has stolen a Ziggy and passed it off as his own. I can prove it. Quick Elaine, to my archives."
S09E13,GEORGE,"You know, you know what's great about our relationship?...It's not about looks."
S09E13,JANET,It's not?
S09E13,GEORGE,"No, Can't be...For instance I remember when we first met, we had a great conversation."
S09E13,JANET,I remember you said I was the prettiest girl at the party.
S09E13,GEORGE,....But after that we really talked didn't we?
S09E13,JANET,"Well,you told me how familiar I looked and that you must have seen me somewhere before."
S09E13,GEORGE,Na....no ... This relationship he..he..has got to be about something and fast or I'm in very serious and weird trouble....hum What else happened?
S09E13,JANET,You asked for a piece of gum because you thought your breath smelled like hummus.
S09E13,GEORGE,Aw right YES! GUM! Good enough I'll take it.
S09E13,JANET,I like gum.
S09E13,GEORGE,I do too. you see that's what we're about . You don't remind me of anyone and we love gum.
S09E13,JANET,I have gum in my hair.
S09E13,GEORGE,I'm losin' it
S09E13,SALLY,"(joining Kramer) Hey! Your Jerry's friend. You're Goofy, mind if I sit. My show is going really well. Have you seen it yet? you should. Everybody else have and you know what? I got recognized the other day, How weird is that. I know . At first I liked the attention but it's like Whoa!! take three steps back, Get a life, okay. but then there wouldn't be a Sally Weaver without the fans, know what I mean. But who am I? anyway. I mean there's Sally weaver the woman, Sally Weaver the artist, Sally Weaver the person..."
S09E13,KRAMER,"(loudly) Now you gotta shut up!.....(Sally is speechless)...I'm sorry, I..I haven't spoken in days."
S09E13,SALLY,"Well, lay it on me string bean."
S09E13,JANET,Let me get this gum out of my hair and then I'll be ready for bed.
S09E13,GEORGE,"OK Look, the gum isn't cutting it for me. We need to be about something else...anything..please."
S09E13,JANET,George.
S09E13,GEORGE,Your hair?
S09E13,JANET,Well I had to cut the gum out and I had a little trouble getting it even. So why don't you get undressed George. (George speeds out the door)
S09E13,GEORGE,George is in big trouble....
S09E13,JERRY,You ripped off a Ziggy?
S09E13,ELAINE,"It must've seeped up my subconscious, Puddy has Ziggy bed sheets....D'you read the comics today?"
S09E13,JERRY,"I see that Ziggy's back at the complaint department.. ""The New Yorker is stealing my ideas."" ha ha ha See that's funny.....'cause it's real."
S09E13,ELAINE,Hey look it ;Sally's cable show's on (Kramer turns around to leave)
S09E13,JERRY,"Hey! Kramer come on in. You've got to watch this, now she's got nothing."
S09E13,SALLY,(on TV) Master of Evil Jerry Seinfeld has broke off all contacts with me.
S09E13,JERRY,That's right sister. Why don't you just give up?
S09E13,ELAINE,Why are you yelling at the TV?
S09E13,SALLY,..OK get this; I heard he makes his best friend date women that look just like him.Hello issues..
S09E13,JERRY,"Elaine, have you been talking to her?"
S09E13,ELAINE,Hey! I'm just a fan..ha ha...
S09E13,SALLY,Oh and speaking of issues . Guess who got a no-polish manicure and begged his neighbor not to tell anyone?
S09E13,JERRY,(to Kramer) I thought you stopped talking??
S09E13,KRAMER,...All right ..Starting now......
S09E13,JERRY,You broke up with her just because she cut her hair! how short?
S09E13,GEORGE,like that (looking at Jerry)
S09E13,JERRY,You mean like.. (points to his hair)
S09E13,GEORGE,..That.
S09E13,JERRY,So she..
S09E13,GEORGE,Yes..
S09E13,JERRY,And you don't...
S09E13,GEORGE,Nooo...
S09E13,JERRY,So...
S09E13,GEORGE,Exactly..
S09E13,JERRY,Hmmmm...
S09E13,GEORGE,We...must never ever speak of this again..
S09E13,JERRY,"No, no......(long pause . they stare at the walls) Hey uh.. you want to see a movie?"
S09E13,GEORGE,Actually I think I'm gonna take a few days off (starts to leave)
S09E13,JERRY,I think that's for the best.
S09E14,GEORGE,"(clears throat) Maura, I, uh- I want you to know... I-I've given this a lot of thought. I'm sorry, but... we, uh, we have to break up."
S09E14,MAURA,No. (sips her drink)
S09E14,GEORGE,(double takes) What's that?
S09E14,MAURA,We're not breaking up. (takes another sip)
S09E14,GEORGE,(puzzled) W-we're not?
S09E14,MAURA,No. (hands George his cup)
S09E14,GEORGE,All right (he smiles weakly at Maura)
S09E14,JERRY,She said no?
S09E14,GEORGE,She said no.
S09E14,JERRY,What did you do?
S09E14,GEORGE,What could I do?! We fooled around and went to a movie!
S09E14,JERRY,"George, both parties don't have to consent to a break-up. It's not like you're launching missiles from a submarine and you both have to turn your keys. Obviously, you didn't make a convincing case. Let me hear your arguments."
S09E14,GEORGE,"Well, I don't really like her."
S09E14,JERRY,That's good.
S09E14,GEORGE,I don't find her attractive.
S09E14,JERRY,Solid.
S09E14,GEORGE,I'd like to sleep with a LOT of other women.
S09E14,JERRY,Always popular.
S09E14,GEORGE,"Sometimes at restaurants she talks to her food 'Ooh, Mr. Mashed Potatoes, you are sooo goood.'"
S09E14,JERRY,You have an airtight case!
S09E14,GEORGE,And in bed--
S09E14,JERRY,I'm afraid we're out of time.
S09E14,JERRY,Hey.
S09E14,GEORGE,What?
S09E14,JERRY,"Check these out. These are Jerry Lewis' old cufflinks that he actually wore in the movie ""Cinderfella"". I got 'em at an auction."
S09E14,GEORGE,I got some cufflinks I could've loaned you.
S09E14,JERRY,"No, Jerry Lewis is gonna be at this Friar's Club roast I'm goin' to next week. Now I have an in to strike up a conversation with him."
S09E14,GEORGE,You already have an in. You have the same first name!... (no reaction) 'Jerry'!
S09E14,JERRY,"Oh, that'll intrigue him."
S09E14,GEORGE,"Well, it worked when I met George Peppard last week."
S09E14,JERRY,George Peppard has been dead for years.
S09E14,GEORGE,"Well, whoever he was, he knew a lot about The A-Team!"
S09E14,GLENN,So you would choose your last meal based on the method of execution?
S09E14,ELAINE,"Right, right. I mean, if I was getting the chair, I'd go for something... hot and spicy, you know... Thai, maybe Mexican. Lethal injection, feels like pasta... you know, painless, don't want anything too heavy..."
S09E14,GLENN,"So, um, why don't we get together some time?"
S09E14,ELAINE,"Oh, sure! Why don't you give me your number?"
S09E14,GLENN,I think it'd be better if I called you.
S09E14,ELAINE,Oh. OK. Maybe we could grab some lunch sometime. D-do you work around here or-?
S09E14,GLENN,"Mm mm... no, not really."
S09E14,ELAINE,"So, is there anything you can tell me about yourself?"
S09E14,GLENN,(seductive tone) I think you're very beautiful.
S09E14,ELAINE,(flattered) Oh (laughs) That'll do! (laughs some more)
S09E14,JERRY,What about Puddy?
S09E14,ELAINE,"I haven't talked to him in, like, three weeks... I THINK it might be over..."
S09E14,JERRY,"(unimpressed) So, what's this guy about?"
S09E14,ELAINE,"I don't know. He wouldn't tell me his phone number, where he worked... I'll bet he's in a relationship."
S09E14,JERRY,"Or he's a crime fighter safeguarding his secret identity! Elaine, you could be dating the Green Lantern!"
S09E14,ELAINE,Which one is he?
S09E14,JERRY,"Green suit, power ring."
S09E14,ELAINE,I don't care for jewellery on men (wags her finger disapprovingly)
S09E14,KRAMER,Hey. It happened again. (puts box on counter) Another robbery in the building.
S09E14,JERRY,So you bought a cooler?
S09E14,KRAMER,"No, it's a strongbox to protect my irreplaceables."
S09E14,ELAINE,And... what would those be?
S09E14,KRAMER,"Some taxidermy that's been in my family for generations, my Tony, my... military discharge."
S09E14,JERRY,(doubtful) You were in the Army?
S09E14,KRAMER,"Y- B-briefly. Now, I gotta find a good place to hide this key. Because if somebody finds this, they hold the key to all my possessions. (makes a clicking sound)"
S09E14,ELAINE,Literally.
S09E14,KRAMER,"(offended) 'Literally'? What's THAT supposed to mean? (then to Jerry, before Elaine can answer) You mind if I hide this somewhere?"
S09E14,JERRY,"No, go ahead."
S09E14,KRAMER,"(stuttering gibberish, gestures that they should leave) A little... privacy, uh?"
S09E14,JERRY,"Oh, come on!"
S09E14,ELAINE,Oh!
S09E14,KRAMER,"Come on, Jerry, this is a security issue! (Elaine laughs) Boy, you wouldn't last a DAY in the Army."
S09E14,JERRY,(walking towards door with Elaine) How long did you last? (opens door)
S09E14,KRAMER,"Well, that's classified."
S09E14,ELAINE,"Hey, what if he's married?"
S09E14,JERRY,Kramer?!
S09E14,ELAINE,"No, the Green Lantern."
S09E14,KRAMER,(from inside) OK!
S09E14,JERRY,"So, you would date a married guy? That's so hacky."
S09E14,ELAINE,"Well, I don't know. I may never marry. It might be the closest I get."
S09E14,KRAMER,(bangs arm of couch in frustration) You peeked!
S09E14,JERRY,THIS is your hiding place?! (Elaine laughs)
S09E14,KRAMER,It was under a spoon!
S09E14,GEORGE,"And so, for all these reasons, we are officially broken up. (shuts book and reaches for door) Thank you, (opens door) and good night."
S09E14,MAURA,"No, George, we're not."
S09E14,GEORGE,(gestures towards book) But I proved it!
S09E14,MAURA,I refuse to give up on this relationship. It's like... launching missiles from a submarine. Both of us have to turn our keys.
S09E14,GEORGE,"Well, then, I am gonna have to ask you to turn your key."
S09E14,MAURA,"(assertive) I'm sorry, George, I can't do that."
S09E14,GEORGE,"(shouting) Turn your key, Maura. Turn your key!"
S09E14,ELAINE,"So, how is a guy like you not involved?"
S09E14,GLENN,I might ask you the same thing.
S09E14,ELAINE,"(in her mind) That's true, maybe he's not married."
S09E14,ELAINE,"Oh, that is so sweet."
S09E14,ELAINE,"(in her mind, cynical) How long do I have to hold this?"
S09E14,GLENN,"(seeing a woman on the street) Oh, no."
S09E14,ELAINE,Who is it?
S09E14,GLENN,"Um, uh, no one, no one. (running with Elaine into an alley) Here, uh, let me show you a short cut. Come on. Come on."
S09E14,ELAINE,"(in her mind) Married. That's it, I'm chucking the flower. (she does)"
S09E14,ELAINE,(shouting up) Jerry! Jerry!
S09E14,JERRY,"Elaine, what are you doin' down there?"
S09E14,ELAINE,You didn't hear me buzzing?
S09E14,JERRY,"Oh, I guess it's broken!"
S09E14,ELAINE,Throw down your key.
S09E14,JERRY,It's liable to bounce and go into a sewer.
S09E14,ELAINE,I'll catch it!
S09E14,JERRY,You'll chicken out at the last second.
S09E14,ELAINE,"...Yeah, you're right. Well, will you at least keep me company until somebody comes out?"
S09E14,JERRY,"(annoyed) All right. (after a pause) Hey, you know what's weird?"
S09E14,ELAINE,Huh?
S09E14,JERRY,I used to be able to have a huge meal and go right to sleep. But I can't anymore.
S09E14,ELAINE,"Nodding off!... Well, I was right. He's an adulterer. And he's cheating on his wife with me!"
S09E14,JERRY,All right.
S09E14,JERRY,Here! I'm gonna try and fix the buzzer.
S09E14,ELAINE,(from the street) It went in the sewer! (Jerry reacts)
S09E14,JERRY,Hey...
S09E14,KRAMER,(re buzzer box) What are you doin'?
S09E14,JERRY,(waving the key) You jammed your key in here? You shorted out my intercom!
S09E14,KRAMER,"(grabbing the key) You just had to go lookin' for it, didn't you? See, you hate it that I have a little secret. Anything I do -- oooh, oooh! -- you gotta know all about it. You're so OBSESSED with me."
S09E14,JERRY,I'm gonna go let Elaine in. (Kramer reaches out to stop him leaving)
S09E14,KRAMER,"Oo, y- what are you doing with her? (Jerry ignores him and exits)"
S09E14,JERRY,"(in the hallway, hearing the door lock behind him, turns back) Kramer!"
S09E14,KRAMER,(from inside) Security issue!
S09E14,JERRY,"Oh, hey. You got in."
S09E14,ELAINE,"Yeah, flirted with the menu guy. Here. (hands him a large stack of papers)"
S09E14,JERRY,"(taking the menus) Oh, thanks."
S09E14,KRAMER,(clattering inside) That wasn't me!
S09E14,JERRY,"So, he's definitely married, huh?"
S09E14,ELAINE,Uh...
S09E14,JERRY,"Boy, I would love to have been there when you told him off."
S09E14,JERRY,"Oh, come on!"
S09E14,ELAINE,"Well, he could be a superhero! You should've seen him run."
S09E14,KRAMER,(from inside Jerry's apartment) OK! (door opens)
S09E14,KRAMER,"All right, Jerry. Let's see if you can get it in your head that this is not an Easter egg hunt for your childish amusement. (shuts door)"
S09E14,GEORGE,(from the street below Jerry's window) Jerry!
S09E14,JERRY,"(out of window) George, the buzzer's broken! I'll come down!"
S09E14,JERRY,"(putting on his coat to go downstairs, he finds the key in his coat pocket) I believe this belongs to you."
S09E14,KRAMER,Heyyyy! (bangs the table in frustration and grabs the key)
S09E14,JERRY,(opens the door for George) Where did you get that?
S09E14,GEORGE,(puzzled) I bought it. (enters lobby)
S09E14,Phil,(walking up to get inside after George) Thanks.
S09E14,JERRY,(barring the way) I'm sorry. I-I don't know you.
S09E14,PHIL,What?
S09E14,JERRY,There's been some robberies in the building. I-I can't let you in.
S09E14,PHIL,"But, I live here! I ran out to buy some birdseed, and-and I forgot my key."
S09E14,GEORGE,Sounds like a scam. (takes a bite from the granola bar)
S09E14,JERRY,(shakes his head) I'm very sorry. (closing the door on Phil. Jerry smiles and shrugs apologetically as Phil stares at them through the glass)
S09E14,GEORGE,"So, I broke up with Maura. It's done. I'm out."
S09E14,JERRY,"Great, you're lonely and miserable again. (presses button to call elevator)"
S09E14,GEORGE,Feels right. (cheerfully takes another bite)
S09E14,JERRY,"Is that guy still there? (They are side-on to Phil who is in the background, still pressed against the glass, aghast)"
S09E14,GEORGE,(looking at the door) He's starin' at us.
S09E14,JERRY,Don't look at him. (Phil starts to knock on the door)
S09E14,JERRY,We don't hear that. (They enter the elevator)
S09E14,GEORGE,Want a bite?
S09E14,JERRY,"Nooo, I don't. (the elevator doors shut)"
S09E14,GEORGE,"(in his mind) I think that ginger ale at the coffee shop is just Coke and Sprite mixed together. How can I prove it? Ah! Can't, dammit. (knock at door. George goes to open it)"
S09E14,MAURA,"(cheerily) Hey, Honey. (she sweeps in, shuts the door behind her, and sits down)"
S09E14,GEORGE,"(still by the door) What? M-Maura, what are you doin' here? I ended this relationship... twice!"
S09E14,MAURA,"George, you didn't mean that. That was just a fight."
S09E14,GEORGE,Why does it always seem like I'm the only one working at this break-up?
S09E14,MAURA,"George, I listened to your arguments, and they were rambling and flimsy. I'm not convinced. Come on, get dressed and let's get some dinner."
S09E14,GEORGE,(pauses to consider this then gives in) All right. (starts heading towards bedroom)
S09E14,MAURA,"(picking up the apple) Eww, Mr. Apple. You have a brown spot. (George freezes, shakes his head, and continues walking)"
S09E14,ELAINE,"So, this is your little... love nest? (laughs)"
S09E14,GLENN,"It's nothing special, just a little place I keep."
S09E14,ELAINE,Oh.
S09E14,GLENN,"Ah, should I light a fire?"
S09E14,ELAINE,"Oh, that sounds... romantic."
S09E14,GLENN,"I'm having a little problem with the heat. Um, I got some cardboard out here. (climbing through the window)"
S09E14,ELAINE,"(in her mind, anguished) This is wrong. I should go. (There's a knock at the door)"
S09E14,GLENN,"(leaning in) Can you get that, please?"
S09E14,ELAINE,"Oh, sure."
S09E14,WOMAN,Where's Glenn?
S09E14,ELAINE,"(guiltily) Ah... You're the woman from the street, and I am so sorry. You know, I'm not really a home-wrecker. I-I-I-I-I thought he was a superhero. I swear."
S09E14,WOMAN,"Lady, I'm not his wife, I'm his welfare caseworker. Is he home?"
S09E14,ELAINE,This is his home?
S09E14,WOMAN,Yes.
S09E14,ELAINE,"So, he's..."
S09E14,WOMAN,(nodding) Poor. (Elaine mouths 'oo')
S09E14,GLENN,(coming back through the window carrying an old chair) I think this will burn!
S09E14,JERRY,So you do live here.
S09E14,PHIL,(sulkily) Yeah. (Jerry has an anguished expression as the elevator doors shut)
S09E14,JERRY,You live on this floor?
S09E14,PHIL,Yeah.
S09E14,JERRY,"(arriving at apartment, sees Phil start to open his apartment door, only one door down from Kramer's) So you live right... there."
S09E14,PHIL,Yeah. (enters his apartment)
S09E14,JERRY,So I guess I'll s--
S09E14,ELAINE,He wouldn't give me his number because he doesn't have a phone. (unwrapping a lollipop) He's not married. He's poor. (puts lollipop in her mouth)
S09E14,JERRY,Is he wretchedly poor? Does he wear one of those barrels with the straps?
S09E14,ELAINE,He probably busted it up and burned it for heat.
S09E14,JERRY,"So, when are you giving Boxcar Willie his walking papers?"
S09E14,ELAINE,How can I end it over money? I feel bad.
S09E14,JERRY,"Well, let's think. Have you ever dealt with the poor in any other situation?"
S09E14,ELAINE,Yes. There was this homeless guy who used to urinate on our garbage cans.
S09E14,JERRY,Good. How did you handle that?
S09E14,ELAINE,"Well, we gave him a few bucks, and... now he goes in the alley across the street."
S09E14,JERRY,"Same situation. Pay him off, and you're clean."
S09E14,ELAINE,"Well, I am NOT paying Glenn off to get out of this relationship. Wh-what am I supposed to do, just walk into his hovel, and hand him... well, how much do you think it would be?"
S09E14,GEORGE,(entering Monk's) Hey.
S09E14,JERRY,"Hey, where have you been?"
S09E14,GEORGE,"(sitting down next to Jerry) Seeing Maura. Apparently, I was unable to break up beyond a reasonable doubt."
S09E14,ELAINE,"If only he could have been cheating on his wife, you know, things would have been so much simpler."
S09E14,GEORGE,"Who's this, Blue Arrow?"
S09E14,ELAINE,Green Lantern.
S09E14,JERRY,We found out his super power was lack of money.
S09E14,ELAINE,(not amused) All right.
S09E14,JERRY,He's invulnerable to creditors.
S09E14,ELAINE,(annoyed) We get it. (George is laughing)
S09E14,JERRY,He's the Got-no-Green Lantern.
S09E14,ELAINE,Thank you. (gets up from her seat)
S09E14,GEORGE,"Hey, Elaine. Maybe his girlfriend is Lois Loan."
S09E14,ELAINE,"(leaning over to George) Ooh, (fake laugh) well crafted. (exits)"
S09E14,GEORGE,"Hey, maybe this cheating thing is what I could use to ditch Maura."
S09E14,JERRY,"Sure, just tell Maura you're having an affair."
S09E14,GEORGE,"She's like a district attorney. If it's not the truth, I'll break under the cross. I actually have to do it."
S09E14,JERRY,(fidgets like he has no room with George next to him)... Could you move over there?!
S09E14,GEORGE,"Hey, you know, there's this secretary at work that always had a crush on me."
S09E14,JERRY,Really? How come you never pursued her before?
S09E14,GEORGE,"She's too tanned. It's the middle of the winter, she's like a carrot."
S09E14,ELAINE,(coming back into Monk's) Did I leave my glasses here?
S09E14,JERRY,"(to Elaine, still joking) He can wipe out his checking account in a single bounce!"
S09E14,ELAINE,(leaving again) Keep 'em! (George and Jerry savour the joke)
S09E14,KRAMER,Heh.
S09E14,JERRY,There's a giant parrot in the hallway.
S09E14,KRAMER,It's Phil's.
S09E14,JERRY,Who?
S09E14,KRAMER,"Our neighbor that you... turned against. (Jerry reacts) Anyway, I told him it'd be fine with us if he wanted to let it stretch its wings out in the hallway."
S09E14,JERRY,What'd ya tell him that for?
S09E14,KRAMER,"Because since you've been playing God with the front door, I've been tryin' to smooth things out, Jerry. In fact, I was just hanging out at his place."
S09E14,JERRY,Really? What's it like? Is it nicer than mine? Where does he have the couch?
S09E14,KRAMER,"Well, I don't know, but the key problem is solved. I hid it at Phil's..."
S09E14,JERRY,He let you?
S09E14,KRAMER,"No, he doesn't know. See, I hid it without tellin' him. So, uh, (starts walking towards door) Phil won't be compulsively looking for it like some people... You! (points at Jerry)"
S09E14,GEORGE,"So, you... you say you've been in the city all winter?"
S09E14,LORETTA,I was in Maine for a couple days. (George looks puzzled at how she's so tanned)
S09E14,GEORGE,Well... (shuts door) heeere we are (puts down his coat and chuckles)
S09E14,LORETTA,"George, I've always fantasized about jumping into bed with you."
S09E14,GEORGE,(excited) Ho ho! (gestures and steps towards bedroom but Loretta walks the other way to the couch)
S09E14,LORETTA,But... I don't want to spoil things by sleeping with you too soon.
S09E14,GEORGE,(walking back) Are you sure? 'Cause it could really help me out of a jam.
S09E14,LORETTA,"I want to build something with you, George."
S09E14,GEORGE,"Oh, not more building."
S09E14,LORETTA,(sighs) And I won't take no for an answer. (she sits down)
S09E14,GEORGE,No?
S09E14,LORETTA,No.
S09E14,GEORGE,"(after hesitating, resignedly) All right. (He sits down and smiles unconvincingly at her)"
S09E14,ELAINE,"So, uh, what are we doing in this alley, anyway?"
S09E14,GLENN,It's a surprise.
S09E14,ELAINE,(giggling) Oh.
S09E14,ELAINE,What are you doing? What is that?
S09E14,GLENN,It's a bag of donuts.
S09E14,ELAINE,It's garbage.
S09E14,GLENN,"No, no, no, no. When they make the new ones, the old ones come out... right here."
S09E14,ELAINE,"(has had enough) All right, that's it. (rummaging in purse, pulls out her chequebook) How do you spell your last name?"
S09E14,GLENN,(still looking through the garbage bag) It's a bear claw! You have no idea how rare this is.
S09E14,ELAINE,(writing out cheque) I'll make it out to cash. How 'bout two hundred bucks? Two-fifty?
S09E14,GLENN,(eating the bear claw) Oooh!
S09E14,ELAINE,Make it three hundred.
S09E14,GLENN,"(re the bear claw) You know, Elaine, you're the bear claw in the garbage bag of my life. (breaks bear claw in half and offers her a piece)"
S09E14,ELAINE,"(touched, she takes it) Aw, Glenn."
S09E14,JERRY,Hi. Is Phil here?
S09E14,Phil,"(from inside the apartment) Yeah, I'm here. (comes to the door. The caged parrot is visible in the background)"
S09E14,JERRY,"Phil... hi. I-I know we got off to kind of a bad start. But your bird, which is lovely... by the way, made a mess on my door."
S09E14,PHIL,And?
S09E14,JERRY,"I thought maybe you'd clean it up, or your maid, there."
S09E14,PHIL,That's my wife.
S09E14,JERRY,"(nodding awkwardly for a moment) All right, I think we're done here. (Jerry leaves and Phil shuts the door darkly)"
S09E14,JERRY,"(in a tuxedo) So, you're in a relationship with a woman you don't like, and you're having an affair with a woman that won't have sex with you."
S09E14,GEORGE,This isn't going well.
S09E14,JERRY,"I cannot find my Jerry Lewis cufflinks. Without 'em, I have no in!"
S09E14,GEORGE,"You don't need the cufflinks! You have the same name! (no reaction) 'Jerry'! (heads for door, grabbing his coat)"
S09E14,JERRY,Where are you goin'? Help me look!
S09E14,GEORGE,"(opening door) It's a big night. I'm, uh, ice skating with one, and going to a staged reading of ""Godspell"" with the other."
S09E14,JERRY,Which is with who?
S09E14,GEORGE,"(shaking his head, weary) It doesn't matter. (he leaves)"
S09E14,KRAMER,"(entering Jerry's apartment, in his own tuxedo) Whoo! Boy. Yeah, you clean up nice."
S09E14,JERRY,I can't go until I find my cufflinks.
S09E14,KRAMER,"Yeah, see? I knew you would lose 'em. That's why I took 'em out of your dresser drawer and put 'em in my strongbox."
S09E14,JERRY,"You're a lifesaver. Would you get them, please?"
S09E14,KRAMER,"Yeah, we'll stop by Phil's, we'll pick up the key, uh?"
S09E14,KRAMER,"Hey, what's going on?"
S09E14,PHIL,Fredo is dead. (his wife sobs)
S09E14,JERRY,That strange Portuguese guy that lives next-door to the incinerator?
S09E14,PHIL,No! My bird. We just got back from the pet cemetery. (starts opening door)
S09E14,JERRY,"Oh, Phil... Mrs. Phil. I'm so sorry."
S09E14,PHIL,"Oh, I'll bet you are! They told us he was poisoned! Something in his food."
S09E14,JERRY,"But I, I didn't, I--"
S09E14,JERRY,"Kramer, they think I killed Fredo! (Kramer gestures sympathetically) And who buries a bird?"
S09E14,KRAMER,"Yeah. Just give it to the Portuguese guy, and he... puts it in the incinerator."
S09E14,JERRY,Just get the key and let's get out of here.
S09E14,KRAMER,"Yeah, yeah. (goes to Phil's door) You know, it's a... it's a funny thing about that bird dying. I hid the key in Fredo's food dish. Whoo! That's a weeeird coincidence."
S09E14,JERRY,"Kramer!? (grabbing Kramer's arm roughly, pulling him back as he's about to knock)"
S09E14,KRAMER,What?
S09E14,JERRY,You killed Fredo!
S09E14,KRAMER,"(high-pitched) Well, Fredo was weak and stupid! He shouldn't have eaten that key!"
S09E14,JERRY,"Kramer, I need those cufflinks, but now they're in the box, and the key is in the bird... What are we gonna do?"
S09E14,KRAMER,You just answered your own question.
S09E14,JERRY,"(frowning in realization) Oh, no!"
S09E14,KRAMER,"(nodding) I'll get the shovel. (walks towards his apartment, as Jerry grimaces at the prospect)"
S09E14,GEORGE,"The, uh, actor that played Jesus made some odd choices."
S09E14,LORETTA,"(shaking head, confused) What?"
S09E14,GEORGE,"I mean, uh... I had fun ice skating."
S09E14,LORETTA,"Oh. (she smiles, reassured, and nods)"
S09E14,MAURA,George?
S09E14,GEORGE,"Maura. (starts acting dramatically, looking from Maura to Loretta and back again) Oh, my God! What are you doing here?!"
S09E14,MAURA,You told me to meet you here for lunch.
S09E14,GEORGE,"(standing up, still acting) Uhh! I'm caught in my own web of lies! (holds his hands up in surrender)"
S09E14,MAURA,(calmly ignoring George) I'm Maura. (shaking Loretta's hand and smiling)
S09E14,LORETTA,"(to Maura, also friendly) I'm Loretta. You want to join us? (Maura nods and sits down next to her)"
S09E14,GEORGE,"(laughs hysterically, gesticulating wildly) This is all blowing up in my face! My serious girlfriend, and my torrid love affair have accidentally crossed paths. I have ruined three lives... (grabbing coat) Well, I understand if you never want to see me again, so... (points towards door)"
S09E14,MAURA,"George, what we have is too important. We can work through this."
S09E14,LORETTA,So can we.
S09E14,GEORGE,"(astounded) What? So, this is still not over?"
S09E14,MAURA,No.
S09E14,GEORGE,You?
S09E14,LORETTA,No.
S09E14,GEORGE,All right. (throws his coat back down on the seat and sits down opposite them)
S09E14,GLENN,"Elaine, wow, a TV, a stereo?"
S09E14,ELAINE,"Yeah, and I got you a cord of wood, so you won't have to burn 'em."
S09E14,GLENN,"Oh, my God, Alison. You're home early."
S09E14,ELAINE,Who is this?
S09E14,ALISON,"(arms crossed, angry) His wife."
S09E14,ELAINE,You're... poor AND married?
S09E14,GLENN,Looks like it.
S09E14,ALISON,Who the hell are you?
S09E14,ELAINE,I guess I'm... Lois Loan.
S09E14,JERRY,"Kramer, I can't believe we're grave robbers."
S09E14,KRAMER,"(reading a tombstone) 'Man's best friend'. Jerry, I want something like that on my tombstone."
S09E14,JERRY,"(seeing Fredo's tombstone) Oh, my God. Here he is. I don't want to dig him up! (hands the shovel to Kramer)"
S09E14,KRAMER,"(sighs) All right, then you're the one getting the key out of him."
S09E14,JERRY,(grimaces and takes the shovel back) I'll dig.
S09E14,KRAMER,"Listen, I heard that Lassie #3 is buried around here. I'm gonna go check it out."
S09E14,JERRY,"(hitting metal with the first strike of the shovel) Well, that was easy."
S09E14,PHIL,"All right, Honey, one last look, then you have to let Fredo rest in peace."
S09E14,JERRY,"(with a wild expression) Hey, Kramer! I dug Fredo up, now let's cut him open!"
S09E14,PHIL,"(horrified) Oh, my God!"
S09E14,JERRY,"(after a very awkward pause, cheerily) Hey, neighbor."
S09E14,GEORGE,All right. I'm gonna try givin' them fifty-five dollars each... (to Elaine) What do you think?
S09E14,ELAINE,"Give me forty, you'll never see me again."
S09E14,ELAINE,"(to Jerry) So, what are you gonna do? Are you gonna live here, or are you gonna move out, or what?"
S09E14,JERRY,"(still in tuxedo, tie undone) Ah, I'll just take the fire escape to get in and out of the building."
S09E14,GEORGE,"So, what's in the cooler? (flips open the lid)"
S09E14,KRAMER,"Oh. Well, would you look at that. (puts a gun-shaped hand to his head and goes 'Pop') I guess I forgot to lock it."
S09E14,JERRY,You mean it was open? We desecrated a pet cemetery for nothing?
S09E14,KRAMER,"Well, this is one for the books, huh, Jerry?... Reeeally one for the books!"
S09E15,GEORGE,When are they gonna learn that any news about China is an instant page-turner? (seeing Jerry with a small black device) What's that?
S09E15,JERRY,It's a Wizard electronic organizer for my dad. I'm goin' to Florida for his birthday.
S09E15,GEORGE,How much was it?
S09E15,JERRY,Two hundred. But I'll tell him it's fifty. He doesn't care about the gift. He gets excited about the deal.
S09E15,GEORGE,Where are you gettin' a Wizard for fifty dollars?
S09E15,JERRY,"Ah, I'll tell him I got it on the street, and maybe it's hot. That's his favorite."
S09E15,GEORGE,I got a message from the Rosses at work today.
S09E15,JERRY,Susan's parents? When's the last time you talked to them?
S09E15,GEORGE,"At the funeral, give or take. You know, deep down, I always kinda felt that they blamed me for Susan's death."
S09E15,JERRY,"Why, because you picked out the poision envelopes? That's silly."
S09E15,ELAINE,"(entering Monk's with her boyfriend) Oh, um... Darryl. These are... people I know. Jerry, George."
S09E15,DARRYL,"Nice meeting you. Ah, I gotta run, Elaine. I'll see you later."
S09E15,ELAINE,OK.
S09E15,JERRY,Still no Puddy?
S09E15,ELAINE,"Uh, I think his answering machine's broken, so I just gave up. Well, what do you think?"
S09E15,JERRY,What? About you datin' a black guy? What's the big deal?
S09E15,ELAINE,What black guy?
S09E15,JERRY,"Darryl. He's black, isn't he?"
S09E15,ELAINE,He is?
S09E15,GEORGE,"No, he isn't."
S09E15,JERRY,"Isn't he, Elaine?"
S09E15,ELAINE,You think?
S09E15,GEORGE,I thought he looked Irish.
S09E15,JERRY,What's his last name?
S09E15,ELAINE,Nelson.
S09E15,GEORGE,That's not Irish.
S09E15,JERRY,I think he's black.
S09E15,GEORGE,Should we be talkin' about this?
S09E15,ELAINE,I think it's OK.
S09E15,GEORGE,"No, it isn't."
S09E15,JERRY,Why not?
S09E15,GEORGE,"Well, it would be OK if Darryl was here."
S09E15,JERRY,If he's black.
S09E15,ELAINE,Is he black?
S09E15,JERRY,Does it matter?
S09E15,ELAINE,"No, course not. I mean, I'd just like to know."
S09E15,JERRY,"Oh, so you need to know?"
S09E15,ELAINE,"No, I don't need to know. I just think it would be nice if I knew."
S09E15,WAITRESS,Should I take that?
S09E15,JERRY,"(getting out his wallet) Uh, one second."
S09E15,ELAINE,"(looking in her purse) Oh, here."
S09E15,GEORGE,"(pulling out some money) Uh, yeah. Hang on. Just... yeah."
S09E15,GEORGE,"(on the phone) Uh, Mrs. Ross? It's-it's George."
S09E15,MRS. ROSS,"Uh, who?"
S09E15,GEORGE,"George Costanza. Susan's, uh, friend? Long time no speak."
S09E15,MR. ROSS,(walking by Mrs. Ross) We're all out of lime juice. I told that woman to buy more.
S09E15,MRS. ROSS,"Uh, George, the Susan Ross Foundation is having an event this weekend."
S09E15,GEORGE,"Oh, I just, uh, leased a house out in the Hamptons, and I have got to get out there this weekend and sign the papers."
S09E15,MR. ROSS,(again walking by) I'm goin' back to bed.
S09E15,MRS. ROSS,"Thank you for calling, George."
S09E15,GEORGE,"Oh, sure. I mean, after all, you were almost my, uh... OK, I gotta go."
S09E15,JERRY,House in the Hamptons?
S09E15,GEORGE,"Well, you know, I've been lyin' about my income for a few years. I figured I could afford a fake house in the Hamptons."
S09E15,KRAMER,(enters) Well.
S09E15,JERRY,Hey.
S09E15,KRAMER,"Well, grab a cigar, boys. Yeah. It's time to celebrate."
S09E15,JERRY,Wow. What are we celebrating?
S09E15,KRAMER,"Uh, you remember my coffee table book?"
S09E15,JERRY,With the little legs?
S09E15,KRAMER,That's the one. A big Hollywood so-and-so optioned it for a movie.
S09E15,GEORGE,How are they gonna make that book into a movie?
S09E15,KRAMER,You remember that photo book on toy ray guns?
S09E15,GEORGE,Yeah?
S09E15,KRAMER,Independence Day?
S09E15,GEORGE,Oh.
S09E15,JERRY,How much are they payin' you?
S09E15,KRAMER,Let's just say that I don't have to worry about working for a while. A long while.
S09E15,JERRY,That's funny because I haven't seen you working for a while. A long while.
S09E15,KRAMER,"Yeah, and you're not going to, because I'm hanging it up. Boys, I'm retiring."
S09E15,JERRY,From what?
S09E15,KRAMER,"From the grind. I mean, who needs it? I mean, I've accomplished everything I've set out to do."
S09E15,JERRY,(seeing that Kramer has a new watch) What's that?
S09E15,KRAMER,"Oh, I bought myself a little retirement gift. Gold watch."
S09E15,JERRY & GEORGE,Ooh!
S09E15,KRAMER,"Well, it's not really gold."
S09E15,JERRY & GEORGE,Aww.
S09E15,ELAINE,(as Darryl opens his door) Hey.
S09E15,DARRYL,Hey.
S09E15,ELAINE,Great music.
S09E15,DARRYL,"Oh, it's my neighbor. They blast that stuff twenty four hours a day. I hate it."
S09E15,DARRYL,"Yo, you! Turn it down!"
S09E15,ELAINE,"Oh, wow, these are nice. Do they have any cultural significance?"
S09E15,DARRYL,They're... African.
S09E15,ELAINE,Right. African.
S09E15,DARRYL,"Well, not Africa, actually. South Africa."
S09E15,ELAINE,South Africa.
S09E15,DARRYL,"My family used to live there, but, uh, we got out years ago, for obvious reasons. You know how it is."
S09E15,ELAINE,Maybe.
S09E15,GEORGE,"(to a street vender selling hot dogs) You must hate hot dogs, huh? Or else, you, uh, you really like 'em and that's why you, you do this."
S09E15,GEORGE,"I'll tell ya, if I had one of these things, I'd be eatin' hot dogs all the time."
S09E15,VENDER,Are you gonna buy a hot dog or not?
S09E15,GEORGE,Mmm... no.
S09E15,MORTY,"(Jerry comes out of his room, having just woken up) Rise and shine, sleepy head! Ha ha!"
S09E15,JERRY,It's 530 in the morning!
S09E15,HELEN,We let you sleep in.
S09E15,JERRY,"(handing his dad a gift) Well, as long as I'm up. Dad, I got you a birthday present. Here. Happy Birthday."
S09E15,MORTY,"Aw, Jerry. I should be buyin' you presents."
S09E15,JERRY,What does that mean?
S09E15,HELEN,Leave your father alone. It's his birthday.
S09E15,MORTY,Oooh! Heh heh! It's a radar detector.
S09E15,JERRY,Radar detector? I've never seen you go over twenty miles an hour. You're like the Grand Marshall of the Rose Bowl Parade. It's a Wizard organizer.
S09E15,MORTY,This looks like too much money.
S09E15,JERRY,"Nah, I got it from a guy on the street. It was, like, fifty bucks."
S09E15,MORTY,You think it's hot?
S09E15,JERRY,Could be.
S09E15,MORTY,"Attaboy! Helen, Jerry got me a hot Wizard computer!"
S09E15,HELEN,I'm right here.
S09E15,JERRY,"And you can do everything with it. You can get e-mail, fax, there's a calculator."
S09E15,MORTY,"So, I can use it in the restaurant to figure out the tip?"
S09E15,JERRY,"Yeah, I guess. But the really cool thing is the daily planner."
S09E15,MORTY,"Helen, we got into restaurants and figure out the tips."
S09E15,HELEN,"Jerry, you're getting your father too excited."
S09E15,KRAMER,"(entering the condo, and going to the fridge as if he's a neighbor) Hey, buddy. When'd you get here?"
S09E15,JERRY,"Kramer, what are you doing here?"
S09E15,KRAMER,I told you I was retiring. I moved in next door.
S09E15,HELEN,"Mr. Kornstein died, and it's a beautiful apartment."
S09E15,KRAMER,"Yeah, your, uh, folks said it was for rent, so I jumped on it."
S09E15,JERRY,"Kramer, you can't live down here. This is where people come to die."
S09E15,JERRY,(getting looks from his parents) Not you. Older people.
S09E15,HELEN,Don't eat cookies for breakfast! I'll fix you something. How 'bout a feta cheese omelette?
S09E15,KRAMER,"Mmmm, that sounds great, Mom."
S09E15,JERRY,"If you feed him, he'll never leave."
S09E15,HELEN,We don't have any feta. How about cottage cheese and Egg Beaters?
S09E15,KRAMER,(immaturely) I guess.
S09E15,JERRY,I can't believe this.
S09E15,KRAMER,"I know, I know. Don't I look more relaxed?"
S09E15,ELAINE,"So, George, do you have any thoughts on this Darryl situation?"
S09E15,GEORGE,"Actually, I did have a thought."
S09E15,ELAINE,Oh.
S09E15,GEORGE,Why don't you just ask him?
S09E15,ELAINE,"(rudely and giving him a 'duh' look) Because, if I ask him, then it's like I really want to know."
S09E15,GEORGE,"Maybe he's, um... mixed."
S09E15,ELAINE,Is that the right word?
S09E15,GEORGE,I really don't think we're supposed to be talkin' about this.
S09E15,ELAINE,Yeah.
S09E15,GEORGE,(standing up) I'm just gonna go to the bathroom.
S09E15,ELAINE,"(starting to leave) You know what, I'm leavin'."
S09E15,GEORGE,Yeah.
S09E15,ELAINE,"I'll just talk to Jerry when he gets back. (seeing the Rosses entering Monk's) Oh. Mrs. Ross, Mr. Ross."
S09E15,MRS. ROSS,"Oh, you're George's friend."
S09E15,MR. ROSS,"We saw him in the city this weekend. Uh, what happened to his place in the Hamptons?"
S09E15,ELAINE,"(laughing uproariously) The Hamptons? George Costanza? I, uh... I don't think so. Have a good one."
S09E15,GEORGE,Rosses.
S09E15,MR. ROSS,"George, we were just talking about you."
S09E15,GEORGE,"Well, sorry I missed that, uh, charity thing. But this was one of those truly glorious Hampton weekends that you always hear about."
S09E15,MRS. ROSS,Really?
S09E15,GEORGE,"Yeah, I may move out there. (getting 'yeah, right' glances from the Rosses) I mean it, I'll do it! OK, I'll see ya later. Keep it real!"
S09E15,MORTY,"(eating lunch with Helen and Jerry) Another fine meal, and now for my Wizard tip calculator."
S09E15,JERRY,"Dad, it's got lots of other functions."
S09E15,MORTY,Don't worry. I'll get to the other functions. (trying to open it) I can't get it open.
S09E15,HELEN,Yay! Jerry got it open.
S09E15,MORTY,The service was slow. And God forbid they should refill the water. How does 12.4% sound?
S09E15,JERRY,"(looking at the Wizard) Well, your tip is four dollars and thirty-six point six six six six cents."
S09E15,MORTY,We'll round down.
S09E15,HELEN,"Jerry, it was so nice of you to come down here on your father's birthday. You've helped take his mind off the condo elections."
S09E15,JERRY,"Oh, right. You can't run for condo president because you were impeached at the other condo."
S09E15,MORTY,I was never impeached! I resigned!
S09E15,HELEN,"Even so, the press would bury him!"
S09E15,JERRY,What press?
S09E15,HELEN,"The condo newsletter, the Boca Breeze."
S09E15,MORTY,Pinko Commie rag.
S09E15,OLD MAN,"(coming up to the three Seinfelds) Hey, Morty. Your boy here, he just got a date with that young aquacise instructor."
S09E15,JERRY,She's fifty.
S09E15,OLD MAN,You know what he's got? He's got charisma. That's my man.
S09E15,KRAMER,"All right, I'll see you guys."
S09E15,OLD MAN,Yeah.
S09E15,KRAMER,Yeah.
S09E15,KRAMER,"(taping Morty's glasses) Morty, what're you lookin' at?"
S09E15,MORTY,"I'll tell you what I'm looking at the next condo president of Del Boca Vista, Phase Three."
S09E15,KRAMER,Hmm.
S09E15,DARRYL,"Elaine, thank you for the Wizard!"
S09E15,DARRYL,"Wow, it's got so many functions."
S09E15,ELAINE,"Yeah, yeah. Forget about all that. First thing is first. Warranty information. Name, we know that. Uh, hobbies. Skiing, racquetball..."
S09E15,DARRYL,"Well, I don't do that stuff."
S09E15,ELAINE,"It doesn't matter, it doesn't matter, it doesn't matter. Um. Oh, here's one race."
S09E15,DARRYL,Isn't that optional?
S09E15,ELAINE,It certainly should be. It's nobody's damn business! But they really would like to know.
S09E15,DARRYL,"All right, I'm... Asian."
S09E15,ELAINE,What?
S09E15,DARRYL,Just to mess with 'em.
S09E15,ELAINE,laughing awkwardly Oh. Right. Good one.
S09E15,DARRYL,"Average income, uh... over a hundred thousand."
S09E15,ELAINE,Really?
S09E15,DARRYL,Does that matter?
S09E15,ELAINE,"No, but... it is very nice to know."
S09E15,JERRY,"(in his parent's condo, on the phone with Elaine) So did you figure out Darryl's... you know."
S09E15,ELAINE,"(in Jerry's apartment) Ah, I've given up. So, now we're going to a bunch of Spanish restaurants. I figure that'll cover us either way."
S09E15,JERRY,(as Kramer walks by) You're a master of race relations.
S09E15,ELAINE,"Hey, so Kramer's running for president of the condo?"
S09E15,JERRY,"Yeah, it's all my father's doing."
S09E15,JERRY,He wants to install Kramer in a puppet regime and then wield power from behind the scenes. Preferably from the sauna in the clubhouse.
S09E15,ELAINE,"Oh, heh heh heh. Who are they running against?"
S09E15,JERRY,Common sense and a guy in a wheelchair.
S09E15,GEORGE,(entering Jerry's apartment) Jerry?
S09E15,ELAINE,(to George) He's still down with his folks.
S09E15,GEORGE,(to Elaine) What are you doin' here?
S09E15,JERRY,"(overhearing the other two Elaine, Elaine--"
S09E15,ELAINE,(to George) I'm gettin' his mail.
S09E15,JERRY,"(overhearing the other two) Oh, no."
S09E15,GEORGE,(to Elaine) He asked you to get the mail?
S09E15,ELAINE,(to George) Mm-hmm.
S09E15,GEORGE,"(taking the phone from Elaine) Jerry, why is Elaine getting your mail?"
S09E15,JERRY,"George, listen to me. I have a very important job for you. I want you to come by twice a day and flush the toilet so the gaskets don't dry out and leak."
S09E15,ELAINE,(trying to understand what they're talking about) What?
S09E15,GEORGE,What about the mail?
S09E15,JERRY,"This is far more important. You must exercise the gaskets, George."
S09E15,GEORGE,"(hanging up) All right, Jerry. I'll do it. See ya."
S09E15,GEORGE,"So, I ran into the Rosses again."
S09E15,ELAINE,"Oh, right, at the coffee shop. Where did they get the idea that you have a place in the Hamptons?"
S09E15,GEORGE,From me.
S09E15,ELAINE,What did you say?
S09E15,GEORGE,I told them I have a place in the Hamptons. What did you say?
S09E15,ELAINE,I told them you didn't. And I laughed and I laughed.
S09E15,GEORGE,"So, they knew? Those liars!"
S09E15,ELAINE,But you lied first.
S09E15,GEORGE,"Yeah, but they let me go on and on all about the Hamptons, they never said a thing! You don't let somebody lie when they know you're lying. You call them a liar!"
S09E15,ELAINE,Like you're a liar!
S09E15,GEORGE,Yes. Thank you! Is that so hard?
S09E15,ELAINE,"So, this is over, not over? I'm bettin', not over."
S09E15,GEORGE,"Hmm-hmm, not by a long shot. I'm calling up the Rosses and inviting them up to my non-existent place in the Hamptons. Then we'll see who blinks first."
S09E15,ELAINE,Haven't you done enough to these people?
S09E15,GEORGE,"This is not about them. Now, if you'll excuse me, I have to exercise Jerry's gaskets."
S09E15,KRAMER,"(to a room) Vote for Kramer. (to a man walking by) Cosmo Kramer. I'm running for condo president. I'd like your vote. Thanks. (to an old woman) Remember, ma'am, a vote for me, is a vote for Kramer."
S09E15,OLD WOMAN,Will you cut my meat?
S09E15,KRAMER,Gladly.
S09E15,WAITRESS,(to Darryl) Coffee?
S09E15,DARRYL,Sure.
S09E15,WAITRESS,(to Darryl) Are you black? Or should I bring some cream.
S09E15,DARRYL,"I'm black. (re-thinking) Oh, you know what? Bring a little cream. (seeing a couple gesturing towards him and Elaine) Did you hear that?"
S09E15,ELAINE,What?
S09E15,DARRYL,"God, there are still people who have trouble with an interracial couple."
S09E15,ELAINE,Interracial? Us?
S09E15,DARRYL,Isn't that unbelievable!?
S09E15,ELAINE,"Yes, it's awful! They're upset because we're an interracial couple. That is racism!"
S09E15,DARRYL,I don't feel like eating.
S09E15,ELAINE,"Me neither. Well, maybe this turkey club."
S09E15,GEORGE,So... here I am. Ready to take you to the Hamptons.
S09E15,MRS. ROSS,Sounds grand.
S09E15,GEORGE,Do you have your bathing suits?
S09E15,MR. ROSS,It's March.
S09E15,GEORGE,"Speak now, or we are headed to the Hamptons. It's a two-hour drive. Once you get in that car, we are going all the way... to the Hamptons. All right, you wanna get nuts? Come on. Let's get nuts!"
S09E15,JERRY,"(in his parent's condo, to his father, who's in another room) Hey, Dad. You know you can program this thing to beep every time you need to take a vitamin. (as Kramer comes walking out in a retirement-like athletic sweatsuit) Dad, you look so different."
S09E15,KRAMER,"Oh, no. We're campaigning, Jerry. To rule the people, one... must walk among them."
S09E15,MORTY,(coming into the hall) This is the home stretch. Tomorrow's the election!
S09E15,KRAMER,"Right. Yeah. The polls close after dinner, three o'clock. But then when we win, the celebration goes all night until the break of eight p.m."
S09E15,JERRY,"You know, you can put that whole schedule right in your daily planner."
S09E15,MORTY,Daily what?
S09E15,HELEN,(coming into the condo) Have you read today's Boca Breeze?
S09E15,KRAMER,"(looking at the newsletter) Hey, look at that. Picture of me, huh? (reading out loud) Candidate Cosmo Kramer caught barefoot in clubhouse."
S09E15,MORTY,Barefoot in the clubhouse? Don't you realize this is against the rules.
S09E15,KRAMER,"Well, I couldn't find my shoes."
S09E15,JERRY,"Kramer, these people work and wait their whole lives to move down here, sit in the heat, pretend it's not hot, and enforce these rules."
S09E15,HELEN,Who wants hot chocolate?
S09E15,KRAMER,"Oh, yeah! Me."
S09E15,MORTY,This is a huge scandal! We need damage control.
S09E15,KRAMER,"All right, look. People seem to like those tip calculators, huh?"
S09E15,JERRY,Wizards!
S09E15,KRAMER,"Yeah, well, how 'bout if we give one out to every member on the condo board."
S09E15,JERRY,Kramer...
S09E15,MORTY,There are twenty people on the board. Thank God you can get that deal.
S09E15,KRAMER,"Payoffs. Now we're playin' politics. All right, what do we next, Morty, huh? Wiretaps, slush funds?"
S09E15,MORTY,"(rushing to his bedroom) First, I need a nap."
S09E15,HELEN,"(running after him) Oh, I'll get your electric blanket!"
S09E15,JERRY,"Kramer, I can't get that many Wizards."
S09E15,KRAMER,"Well, what about your deal, huh?"
S09E15,JERRY,I didn't have a deal! They're two hundred dollars a pop. What do I do?
S09E15,KRAMER,"Well, don't worry about it. I know a guy."
S09E15,JERRY,Down here?
S09E15,KRAMER,"Yeah, Bob Saccamano's father."
S09E15,MRS. ROSS,Tell us more.
S09E15,GEORGE,You want to hear more? The master bedroom opens into the solarium.
S09E15,MR. ROSS,Another solarium?
S09E15,GEORGE,"Yes, two solariums. Quite a find. And I have horses, too?"
S09E15,MR. ROSS,What are their names?
S09E15,GEORGE,Snoopy and Prickly Pete. Should I keep driving?
S09E15,MRS. ROSS,"Oh, look, an antique stand. Pull over. We'll buy you a housewarming gift."
S09E15,GEORGE,"(chuckling to himself) Housewarming gift. (swerving the car to go to the antique stand) All right, we're taking it up a notch!"
S09E15,WAITRESS,(handing Elaine a menu) Here you go.
S09E15,ELAINE,(to the black waitress) Long day?
S09E15,WAITRESS,"Yeah, I just worked a triple shift."
S09E15,ELAINE,"I hear ya, Sister."
S09E15,WAITRESS,Sister?
S09E15,ELAINE,(as Darryl comes into Monk's) Yeah. It's OK. My boyfriend's black. Here he is. See?
S09E15,DARRYL,"Hi, Elaine."
S09E15,ELAINE,Hey.
S09E15,WAITRESS,He's black?
S09E15,ELAINE,Yeah.
S09E15,DARRYL,I'm black?
S09E15,ELAINE,Aren't you?
S09E15,WAITRESS,(leaving) I'll give you a couple minutes to decide.
S09E15,DARRYL,What are you talking about?
S09E15,ELAINE,You're black. You said we were an interracial couple.
S09E15,DARRYL,We are. Because you're Hispanic.
S09E15,ELAINE,I am?
S09E15,DARRYL,Aren't you?
S09E15,ELAINE,No. Why would you think that?
S09E15,DARRYL,"Your name's Benes, your hair, and you kept taking me to those Spanish restaurants."
S09E15,ELAINE,That's because I thought you were black.
S09E15,DARRYL,Why would you take me to a Spanish restaurant because I'm black?
S09E15,ELAINE,I don't think we should be talking about this.
S09E15,DARRYL,"So, what are you?"
S09E15,ELAINE,I'm white.
S09E15,DARRYL,"So, we're just a couple of white people?"
S09E15,ELAINE,I guess.
S09E15,DARRYL,Oh.
S09E15,ELAINE,Yeah. So do you want to go to the Gap?
S09E15,DARRYL,(leaving with Elaine) Sure.
S09E15,KRAMER,"(having lunch with Jerry and his parents) Oh, well... I handed out all the Wizards. Polls close in one hour. Whoo hoo hoo! I think we've got this baby all sewn up, huh? Oh, uh, there was an extra one. Norman Burgerman, he won't be leavin' any tips where he is."
S09E15,JERRY,Aw.
S09E15,MORTY,"Congratulations, Mr. President."
S09E15,KRAMER,"Congratulations, Mr. Puppet Master."
S09E15,OLD MAN,"Hey, Morty, what's wrong with these tip calculators?"
S09E15,MORTY,What are you talking about?
S09E15,OLD MAN,It's overtipping. I just left five bucks for a BLT.
S09E15,MORTY,"This isn't a Wizard, it's a Willard."
S09E15,JERRY,"A Willard? Saccamano, Sr. screwed me!"
S09E15,OLD MAN #2,Mine doesn't have a seven!
S09E15,OLD MAN #3,I'm ruined!
S09E15,MORTY,"Jerry, why didn't you get them Wizards?"
S09E15,JERRY,Because a real Wizard's two hundred dollars.
S09E15,MORTY,You didn't have a deal?
S09E15,JERRY,No deal. Not hot.
S09E15,OLD MAN,"Morty, you, and Kramer, you're finished."
S09E15,KRAMER,What?
S09E15,OLD MAN,Everyone vote for the guy in the wheelchair.
S09E15,KRAMER,"(getting up to leave) Well, the people have spoken. Well, that's it for me. I'm, I'm headin' back to New York."
S09E15,JERRY,"Dad, I'm sorry."
S09E15,MORTY,You should be! How could you spend two hundred dollars on a tip calculator?!
S09E15,JERRY,It does other things!
S09E15,MR. ROSS,"Where are we, George?"
S09E15,GEORGE,Almost there.
S09E15,MR. ROSS,"Well, this is the end of Long Island. Where's your house?"
S09E15,GEORGE,"We, uh, we go on foot from here."
S09E15,MR. ROSS,All right.
S09E15,GEORGE,There's no house! It's a lie! There's no solarium. There's no Prickly Pete. There's no other solarium.
S09E15,MR. ROSS,We know.
S09E15,GEORGE,"Then, why? Why did you make me drive all the way out here? Why didn't you say something? Why? Why? Why?"
S09E15,MRS. ROSS,"We don't like you, George."
S09E15,MR. ROSS,And we always blamed you for what happened to Susan.
S09E15,GEORGE,Oh.
S09E15,MR. ROSS,All right! Let's head back.
S09E16,PUDDY,"Alright, be careful with the car, babe."
S09E16,ELAINE,"Yeah, yeah."
S09E16,PUDDY,"And don't move the seat, I got it right where I like it."
S09E16,ELAINE,Goodbye?
S09E16,PUDDY,"Two and ten, babe."
S09E16,ELAINE,Okay.
S09E16,PUDDY,Don't peel out.
S09E16,ELAINE,I won't.
S09E16,(Elaine peels out and turns on the car stereo. She hears,"""Jesus is one, Jesus is all, Jesus picks me up when I fall..."" Elaine changes the stations but all of the presets are set to religious radio stations; ""And he said unto Abraham..."", ""Amen! Amen!"", ""So we pray..."", ""Saved!"", ""Jey-sus!"" She turns off the radio.)"
S09E16,ELAINE,Jesus?
S09E16,KRUGER,"According to our latest quarterly thing,Kruger Industrial Smoothing is heading into the red. Or the black, or whatever the bad one is. Any thoughts?"
S09E16,GEORGE,"Well, I know when I'm a little strapped, I sometimes drop off my rent check having forgotten to sign it. That could buy us some time."
S09E16,KRUGER,"Works for me. Good thinking, George."
S09E16,CO-WORKER #1,"Alright, George."
S09E16,CO-WORKER #2,Way to go man.
S09E16,GEORGE,"Or we don't even send the check and then when they call, we pretend we're the cleaning service. Heh heh. ""Hello? I sorry, no here Kruger."""
S09E16,KRUGER,"Are you done? Silly voices, c'mon people, let's get real."
S09E16,CO-WORKER #1,Good one.
S09E16,CO-WORKER #2,That was bad.
S09E16,GEORGE,"I had 'em, Jerry. They loved me."
S09E16,JERRY,And then?
S09E16,GEORGE,I lost them. I can usually come up with one good comment during a meeting but by the end it's buried under a pile of gaffs and bad puns.
S09E16,JERRY,"Showmanship, George. When you hit that high note, you say goodnight and walk off."
S09E16,GEORGE,I can't just leave.
S09E16,JERRY,That's the way they do it in Vegas.
S09E16,GEORGE,You never played Vegas.
S09E16,JERRY,I hear things.
S09E16,ELAINE,Here's one. I borrowed Puddy's car and all the presets on his radio were Christian rock stations.
S09E16,GEORGE,I like Christian rock. It's very positive. It's not like those real musicians who think they're so cool and hip.
S09E16,ELAINE,"So, you think that Puddy actually believes in something?"
S09E16,JERRY,"It's a used car, he probably never changed the presets."
S09E16,ELAINE,"Yes, he is lazy."
S09E16,JERRY,Plus he probably doesn't even know how to program the buttons.
S09E16,ELAINE,"Yes, he is dumb."
S09E16,JERRY,So you prefer dumb and lazy to religious?
S09E16,ELAINE,"Dumb and lazy, I understand."
S09E16,GEORGE,Tell you how you could check.
S09E16,ELAINE,How?
S09E16,GEORGE,"Reprogram all the buttons, see if he changes them back. You know? The old switcheroo."
S09E16,JERRY,"No, no, the old switcheroo is you poison your drink then you switch it with the other person's."
S09E16,GEORGE,"No, it's doing the same thing to someone that they did to you."
S09E16,JERRY,"Yeah, Elaine's gonna do the same thing to Puddy's radio that the radio did to her."
S09E16,GEORGE,Well that's the gist of it!
S09E16,ELAINE,Quiet! So where is this Sophie?
S09E16,JERRY,"Oh, she's picking me up in a few minutes."
S09E16,ELAINE,How long have you two been together?
S09E16,JERRY,"I dunno. Since the last one. Oh, here she is. You wanna meet her?"
S09E16,ELAINE & GEORGE,Nah.
S09E16,GEORGE,"By the way, how did Puddy get back in the picture?"
S09E16,ELAINE,I needed to move a bureau.
S09E16,KRAMER,"Hey Jerry, you got any pepper?"
S09E16,MICKEY,Hey Jerry.
S09E16,JERRY,Hey Mickey. Check the pepper shaker.
S09E16,KRAMER,"Yeah. (inhales some pepper then sneezes violently) See? It should sound like that, something like that."
S09E16,MICKEY,Aah-choo.
S09E16,KRAMER,"A little wetter. See, I didn't believe it."
S09E16,JERRY,What's with the fake sneezing?
S09E16,KRAMER,"Yeah, we're going down to Mt. Sinai Hospital, See they hire actors to help the students practice diagnosing."
S09E16,MICKEY,They assign you a specific disease and you act out the symptoms. It's an easy gig.
S09E16,JERRY,Do medical schools actually do this?
S09E16,KRAMER,"Well the better ones. Alright, let's practice retching."
S09E16,KRAMER & MICKEY,HUAAHHH!!
S09E16,JERRY,I think the phone is ringing.
S09E16,KRAMER & MICKEY,HUAAHHH!!
S09E16,JERRY,"Would you hold it a second?! Thank you, will you get out of here with that stuff?"
S09E16,KRAMER,"Mickey, DTs."
S09E16,JERRY,Hello?
S09E16,SOPHIE,Hey. It's me.
S09E16,JERRY,Elaine?
S09E16,SOPHIE,"No, it's me."
S09E16,JERRY,George??
S09E16,SOPHIE,"Jerry, it's Sophie. I can't believe you don't recognize my voice."
S09E16,JERRY,"Oh, I knew it was you, I was joking. I'm a comedian."
S09E16,KRAMER,You got any Ipecac?
S09E16,JERRY,"Ipecac? Kramer, I really think you guys are going too far with this."
S09E16,KRAMER,"No, Mickey, he swallowed twelve aspirin."
S09E16,JERRY,Did he overdose?
S09E16,KRAMER,"No, it's just too much."
S09E16,KRUGER,"...And it gets worse. The team working on the statue in Lafayette Square kind of over-smoothed it. They ground the head down to about the size of a softball, and that spells trouble."
S09E16,GEORGE,"Alright, well why don't we smooth the head down to nothing, stick a pumpkin under its arm and change the nameplate to Ichabod Crane?"
S09E16,GEORGE,(getting up and leaving) Alright! That's it for me. Goodnight everybody.
S09E16,DR. WEXLER,In your packet you will find the disease you have been assigned and the symptoms you will need to exhibit.
S09E16,MICKEY,Bacterial Meningitis. Jackpot!
S09E16,KRAMER,Gonorrhea? You wanna trade?
S09E16,MICKEY,"Sorry buddy, this is the ""Hamlet"" of diseases. Severe pain, nausea, delusions, it's got everything."
S09E16,MAN,Sure.
S09E16,KRAMER,"Okay, what do you got?"
S09E16,MAN,The surgeon left a sponge inside me.
S09E16,KRAMER,Good luck with that.
S09E16,GEORGE,I knew I had hit my high note so I thanked the crowd and I was gone.
S09E16,JERRY,What did you do the rest of the day?
S09E16,GEORGE,"I saw ""Titanic"". So that old woman, she's just a liar, right?"
S09E16,JERRY,And a bit of a tramp if you ask me.
S09E16,ELAINE,Hello boys.
S09E16,GEORGE,"Hey, so, did you give that radio the old switcheroo?"
S09E16,ELAINE,I did.
S09E16,GEORGE,And the Christian rock?
S09E16,ELAINE,"Ressurected! And look what I pried off of his bumper, a Jesus fish!"
S09E16,GEORGE,"Jerry, do you have any fishsticks?"
S09E16,JERRY,No. So you're disappointed he's a spiritual person?
S09E16,ELAINE,"Well yeah, I got him because he seemed so one-dimensional, I feel misled."
S09E16,GEORGE,I think it's neat. You don't hear that much about god anymore.
S09E16,JERRY,"I hear things. Hey, so Sophie gave me the ""It's me"" on the phone today."
S09E16,ELAINE,"""It's me?"" Isn't it a little premature?"
S09E16,JERRY,I thought so.
S09E16,ELAINE,"Hah. She's not a ""me"". I'm a ""me""."
S09E16,GEORGE,"I'm against all ""it's me""s. So self-absorbed and egotistical, it's like those hip musicians with their complicated shoes!"
S09E16,KRAMER,"Well, I got gonorrhea."
S09E16,ELAINE,That seems about right.
S09E16,KRAMER,That's what they gave me.
S09E16,GEORGE,They? The Government?
S09E16,JERRY,"No, no. He's pretending he's got gonorrhea so med students can diagnose it."
S09E16,KRAMER,"And it's a waste of my talent. It's just a little burning. Mickey, he got bacterial meningitis."
S09E16,GEORGE,"I guess there are no small diseases, only small actors."
S09E16,GEORGE,(leaving) Alright that's it for me. Good night everybody.
S09E16,ELAINE,What was that?
S09E16,JERRY,"Showmanship, George is trying to get out on a high note."
S09E16,KRAMER,"See, showmanship. Maybe that's what my gonorrhea is missing."
S09E16,JERRY,Yes! Step into that spotlight and belt that gonorrhea out to the back row.
S09E16,KRAMER,"Yes, yes I will! I'm gonna make people feel my gonorrhea, and feel the gonorrhea themselves."
S09E16,STUDENT #1,And are you experiencing any discomfort?
S09E16,KRAMER,Just a little burning during urination.
S09E16,STUDENT #1,"Okay, any other pain?"
S09E16,KRAMER,"The haunting memories of lost love. May I? (signals to Mickey) Lights? (Mickey turns down the lights and Kramer lights a cigar) Our eyes met across the crowded hat store. I, a customer, and she a coquettish haberdasher. Oh, I pursued and she withdrew, then she pursued and I withdrew, and so we danced. I burned for her, much like the burning during urination that I would experience soon afterwards."
S09E16,STUDENT #1,Gonorrhea?!
S09E16,KRAMER,Gonorrhea!
S09E16,JERRY,One message. Hope it's not from you.
S09E16,ANSWERING MACHINE,"""Hey Jerry, it's me. Call me back."""
S09E16,JERRY,Sophie.
S09E16,GEORGE,She's still doing that?
S09E16,JERRY,Yep.
S09E16,GEORGE,"Alright, I'll tell you what you do. You call her back and give her the ""it's me"", heh? Pull the old switcheroo."
S09E16,JERRY,"I think that's a ""what's good for the goose is good for the gander""."
S09E16,GEORGE,"What the hell is a gander, anyway?"
S09E16,JERRY,"(picking up the phone and dialing) It's a goose that's had the old switcheroo pulled on it. Hi Sophie, it's me."
S09E16,SOPHIE,Hey Raef.
S09E16,JERRY,(to George) She thinks it's someone named Raef.
S09E16,GEORGE,"Good, let her think it."
S09E16,JERRY,"(into the phone, with a disguised voice) So, what's going on?"
S09E16,SOPHIE,Not a lot.
S09E16,GEORGE,"Ask about you, ask about you."
S09E16,JERRY,"So, uh, how are things with Jerry?"
S09E16,SOPHIE,"Oh, I really like him but, well, I still haven't told him the tractor story."
S09E16,JERRY,"Right, right, the tractor story."
S09E16,SOPHIE,"Are you sick, Raef? You sound kinda funny."
S09E16,JERRY,I sound funny?
S09E16,GEORGE,Abort! Abort!
S09E16,JERRY,"Yeah I better get to a doctor, bye. (Hangs up) That was close! What drives me to take chances like that?"
S09E16,GEORGE,That was very real.
S09E16,JERRY,She said there's some tractor story that she hasn't told me about.
S09E16,GEORGE,"Woah, back it up, back it up. Beep, beep, beep. Tractor story?"
S09E16,JERRY,"Beep, beep, beep? What are you doing?"
S09E16,ELAINE,So where do you wanna eat?
S09E16,PUDDY,Feels like an Arby's night.
S09E16,ELAINE,Arby's. Beef and cheese and do you believe in god?
S09E16,PUDDY,Yes.
S09E16,ELAINE,"Oh. So, you're pretty religious?"
S09E16,PUDDY,That's right.
S09E16,ELAINE,So is it a problem that I'm not really religious?
S09E16,PUDDY,Not for me.
S09E16,ELAINE,Why not?
S09E16,PUDDY,I'm not the one going to hell.
S09E16,GEORGE,You know what I think? I bet she stole a tractor.
S09E16,JERRY,"No one's stealing a tractor, it's a five-mile-an-hour getaway. We're dancing around the obvious, it's gotta be disfigurement."
S09E16,GEORGE,Does she walk around holding a pen she never seems to need?
S09E16,JERRY,"No, she looks completely normal."
S09E16,GEORGE,"Oh. Okay, here it is, I got it. She lost her thumbs in a tractor accident and they grafted her big toes on. They do it every day."
S09E16,JERRY,You think she's got toes for thumbs?
S09E16,GEORGE,"How's her handshake? A little firm, isn't it? Maybe a little too firm?"
S09E16,JERRY,I don't know.
S09E16,GEORGE,Hands a little smelly?
S09E16,JERRY,Why do I seek your counsel?
S09E16,ELAINE,Well I'm going to hell.
S09E16,JERRY,That seems about right.
S09E16,ELAINE,According to Puddy.
S09E16,JERRY,"Hey, have you heard the one about the guy in hell with the coffee and the doughtnuts and--"
S09E16,ELAINE,I'm not in the mood.
S09E16,GEORGE,(To a passing waitress) I'll have some coffee and a doughnut.
S09E16,JERRY,What do you care? You don't believe in hell.
S09E16,ELAINE,"I know, but he does."
S09E16,JERRY,So it's more of a relationship problem than the final destination of your soul.
S09E16,ELAINE,"Well, relationships are very important to me."
S09E16,JERRY,Maybe you can strike one up with the prince of darkness as you burn for all eternity.
S09E16,GEORGE,(to the waitress bringing his doughnut) And a slice of devil's food cake.
S09E16,GEORGE,Hey. Where is everyone?
S09E16,KRUGER,"They're all off the project. They were boring. George, you are my main man."
S09E16,GEORGE,I am?
S09E16,KRUGER,"I don't know what it is, I can't put my finger on it, but lately you have just seemed 'on'. And you always leave me wanting more."
S09E16,GEORGE,This is a huge project involving lots of numbers and papers and folders.
S09E16,KRUGER,"Ah, I'm not too worried about it. Let's get started."
S09E16,GEORGE,Okay.
S09E16,KRUGER,"George? Check it out. (He begins to spin around in his chair) Three times around, no feet."
S09E16,GEORGE,And?
S09E16,KRUGER,All me.
S09E16,DR. WEXLER,"Alright, and here are you ailments for this week. By the way, Mr. Kramer, you were excellent."
S09E16,KRAMER,"Oh, thank you."
S09E16,MICKEY,Cirrhosis of the liver with jaundice! Alright I get to wear make-up! What did you get?
S09E16,KRAMER,"Gonorrhea? Excuse me, I think there's been a mistake, see, I had gonorrhea last week."
S09E16,DR. WEXLER,"Oh, it's no mistake. We loved what you did with it."
S09E16,KRAMER,"I don't believe this, I'm being typecast."
S09E16,SOPHIE,I move my knight... here. Check.
S09E16,JERRY,"They should update these pieces, nobody rides horses anymore. Maybe they should change it to a tractor."
S09E16,SOPHIE,"Jerry, are you embarrassed that you're losing?"
S09E16,JERRY,"Losing? You know, yesterday I lost control of my car, almost bought the farm."
S09E16,SOPHIE,Bought the farm?
S09E16,JERRY,Tractor!
S09E16,SOPHIE,"This is an odd side of you, Jerry. I feel uncomfortable."
S09E16,JERRY,"Wait, don't go. Let's thumb wrestle."
S09E16,GEORGE,A scar?
S09E16,JERRY,A big long scar where her leg would dangle when she's riding a...?
S09E16,GEORGE,A tractor.
S09E16,JERRY,I'm sure she's a little self-conscious and doesn't like to talk about it.
S09E16,GEORGE,I don't see why's she more self-conscious about that than her toe thumbs.
S09E16,JERRY,She doesn't have toe thumbs.
S09E16,GEORGE,"Well, if she keeps horsing around with that tractor--"
S09E16,JERRY,Alright. So how's the two-man operation at Kruger?
S09E16,GEORGE,"Two-man? It's all me. Kruger doesn't do anything; Disappears for hours at a time, gives me fake excuses. This afternoon I found him with sleep creases on his face. The only reason I got out to get a bite today was that he finally promised to buckle down and do some actual work. (turning around, George sees Mr. Kruger at a booth eating a piece of cake) Oh, I don't believe this. This is what I have to put up with, Jerry. (He walks over) Mr. Kruger? Who said he was going to do some actual work today? Who?"
S09E16,KRUGER,I'm not too worried about it.
S09E16,GEORGE,Well I am. Couldn't you try to go through some of that stuff I put in your shoebox?
S09E16,KRUGER,"Alright, alright I'm going."
S09E16,GEORGE,(to Jerry) Huh-ho! Have you ever seen anything like this?
S09E16,JERRY,Never.
S09E16,PUDDY,"Elaine, they forgot to deliver your paper today. Why don't you just grab that one."
S09E16,ELAINE,"'Cause that belongs to Mr. Potato Guy, that's his."
S09E16,PUDDY,"C'mon, get it."
S09E16,ELAINE,"Well if you want it, you get it."
S09E16,PUDDY,"Sorry, thou shalt not steal."
S09E16,ELAINE,"Oh, but it's ok for me?"
S09E16,PUDDY,"What do you care, you know where you're going."
S09E16,ELAINE,"Alright, that is it! I can't live like this."
S09E16,PUDDY,Nah.
S09E16,ELAINE,C'mon.
S09E16,PUDDY,"Alright, what did I do?"
S09E16,ELAINE,"David, I'm going to hell! The worst place in the world! With devils and those caves and the ragged clothing! And the heat! My god, the heat! I mean, what do you think about all that?"
S09E16,PUDDY,Gonna be rough.
S09E16,ELAINE,"Uh, you should be trying to save me!"
S09E16,PUDDY,Don't boss me! This is why you're going to hell.
S09E16,ELAINE,"I am not going to hell and if you think I'm going to hell, you should care that I'm going to hell even though I am not."
S09E16,PUDDY,"You stole my Jesus fish, didn't you?"
S09E16,ELAINE,"Yeah, that's right!"
S09E16,MICKEY,"Oh, my liver! Why did I drink all those years? Why did I look for love in a bottle?"
S09E16,DR. WEXLER,Mr. Kramer? You're up.
S09E16,MICKEY,"Wait a minute. You are doing gonorrhea, aren't you?"
S09E16,KRAMER,"Well, we'll see."
S09E16,STUDENT #2,"So, what seems to be bothering you today, Mr. Kramer?"
S09E16,KRAMER,"(pulling a liquor bottle from his jacket pocket) Well, I guess it started about twenty years ago when I got back from Viet Nam, and this was the only friend I had left."
S09E16,MICKEY,Hey! That's my cirrhosis! He's stealing my cirrhosis! (he jumps Kramer) You wanna be sick? I'll make you sick.
S09E16,STUDENT #2,Cirrhosis of the liver and PCP addiction?
S09E16,FATHER CURTIS,Let me see if I understand this. You're concerned that he isn't concerned that you're going to hell. And you feel that she's too bossy.
S09E16,ELAINE & PUDDY,"Yeah, that's right."
S09E16,FATHER CURTIS,"Well, oftentimes in cases of inter-faith marriages, couples have difficulty--"
S09E16,FATHER CURTIS,You aren't?
S09E16,PUDDY,No.
S09E16,ELAINE,"We're just, you know, having a good time."
S09E16,FATHER CURTIS,"Oh, well then it's simple. You're both going to hell."
S09E16,PUDDY,"No way, this is bogus, man!"
S09E16,ELAINE,"Well, thank you father."
S09E16,FATHER CURTIS,"Oh, did you hear the one about the new guy in hell who's talkng to the devil by the coffee machine?"
S09E16,PUDDY,"I'm really not in the mood, I'm going to hell."
S09E16,ELAINE,"Oh, lighten up. It'll only feel like an eternity."
S09E16,SOPHIE,"You know, Jerry, there's this thing that I haven't told you about. See, there was this tractor and, oh boy, this is really difficult."
S09E16,JERRY,"Sophie, it's me. I know about the tractor story and I'm fine with it."
S09E16,SOPHIE,How could you know?
S09E16,JERRY,"(putting his finger to Sophie's lips, then to his own, then back to Sopie's) Shh. Shh. Shh. It's not important. What's important is I'm not gonna let a little thing like that ruin what could be a very long-term and meaningful relationship."
S09E16,KRAMER,"...I didn't say that, no."
S09E16,MICKEY,"You gave me gonorrhea, you didn't even tell me!"
S09E16,KRAMER,"Well, I'm sorry. I gave you gonorrhea because I thought you'd have fun with it."
S09E16,JERRY,"Hey, hey! I'm with someone."
S09E16,KRAMER,Oh. Hello.
S09E16,SOPHIE,"No, I understand. This could be a tough thing to deal with. The important thing is that you have a partner who's supportive."
S09E16,KRAMER,(to Mickey) You know? She's right.
S09E16,SOPHIE,"Unfortunately, I didn't have a partner. I got gonorrhea from a tractor."
S09E16,JERRY,You got gonorrhea from a tractor?? And you call *that* your tractor story??
S09E16,KRAMER,You can't get it from that.
S09E16,SOPHIE,But I did. My boyfriend said I got gonorrhea from riding the tractor in my bathing suit.
S09E16,JERRY,"(walking out) Alright, that's it for me. You've been great. Goodnight everybody."
S09E16,GEORGE,Would you mind helping me out with some of this stuff?!?
S09E16,KRUGER,You seem like you've got a pretty good handle on it.
S09E16,GEORGE,"No! I don't! Don't you even care? This is your company! It's your name on the outside of the building! Speaking of which, the 'R' fell off and all it says now is K-uger!"
S09E16,KRUGER,"K-uger, that sounds like one of those old-time car horns, huh? K-uger! K-uger!"
S09E16,GEORGE,"Huh-ho! Oh! You are too much, Mr. Kruger! Too much!"
S09E16,KRUGER,"(getting up to leave) Thank you George, you've been great. That's it for me."
S09E16,GEORGE,"Oh no, you're not going out on a high note with me Mr. Kruger!"
S09E16,KRUGER,It's K-uger!

S09E17,GEORGE,I read somewhere that this Brentano's is the place to meet girls in New York.
S09E17,JERRY,"First it was the health club, then the supermarket, now the bookstore. They could put it anywhere they want, no one's meetin' anybody."
S09E17,KRAMER,"Jerry, look at all these pagodas, huh? I gotta get over to Hong Kong before it all goes back to China.."
S09E17,JERRY,(Sarcastic) You better hurry.
S09E17,GEORGE,I'm gonna hit the head.
S09E17,KRAMER,"Oh, boy, look at this. Hong Kong's outlawed the rickshaw. See, I always thought those would be perfect for New York."
S09E17,JERRY,(Sarcastic) Yes. The city needs more slow-moving wicker vehicles.
S09E17,KRAMER,"Hmm, Elaine's been to Hong Kong. I should give her a call."
S09E17,JERRY,She's at that annual Peterman party tonight. You know the one she danced at last year?
S09E17,KRAMER,"(Remembering) No, that wasn't dancing."
S09E17,JERRY,"(Pointing) Hey, there's Leo."
S09E17,KRAMER,Oh? Who's Leo?
S09E17,JERRY,Uncle Leo.
S09E17,KRAMER,"Oh, yeah. Right. Uncle, Leo. Forgot his first name.."
S09E17,JERRY,Did I just see that?!

S09E17,WALTER,"(Joking around with her) So, Elaine.. are you going to dance this year?"
S09E17,ELAINE,Maybe.. All over your face!
S09E17,WAITER,"If you do dance, the cooks want to know - so they can be brought out of the kitchen. They missed it last year."
S09E17,PETERMAN,"My friends, a toast. As the wolly-haired Melanasians of Papua, New Guinea once said, (Makes a series of clicking and popping sounds. The music starts up) All right! Who's dancing? (No one makes a gesture that they intend to dance) No one? Alright, I'll just have to get things started. (Grabs a female employee, and starts dancing with her. The crowd is impressed)"

S09E17,GEORGE,(Not sure what the answer should be) What do you want to hear?
S09E17,[Setting,The Coffee shop]
S09E17,GEORGE,"They made me buy it.. A hundred bucks this thing cost me. (Gesturing to the book) How dare they?! I got news for you, if it wasn't for the toilet, there would be no books."
S09E17,JERRY,(Sarcastic) Yeah. I understand Guttenberg used to spend a lot of time in there.
S09E17,GEORGE,"They're selling coffee, bran muffins.. you're surrounded by reading material. It's entrapment!"
S09E17,JERRY,(Reading the cover of the book George was forced to buy) 'French Impressionist Paintings'?
S09E17,GEORGE,I find the soothing pastorial images very conduc-
S09E17,JERRY,(Cutting him off) Thank you very much.
S09E17,GEORGE,"Well, I'm gonna go back there later and return it when there's different people working.. You want to catch a movie?"
S09E17,JERRY,I can't. I'm meeting Uncle Leo. I saw him shoplifting at the bookstore.
S09E17,GEORGE,"(Praising Leo's stealing) Alright, Leo! Stickin' it to the man!"

S09E17,GEORGE,"You, uh, didn't dance again, did you?"
S09E17,ELAINE,"(Angered) No, I found a better way to humiliate myself. There was this guy, and we had a few too many.."
S09E17,GEORGE,You went home with him?
S09E17,ELAINE,Worse. We made out at the table like our plane was going down!
S09E17,JERRY,"(Rubbing it in) Ah, the drunken make-out. An office classic. Did you end up xeroxing anything?"
S09E17,ELAINE,(Gives Jerry a look) Do you know how embarrassing this is to someone in my position?
S09E17,JERRY,(Confused) What's your position?
S09E17,ELAINE,I am an associate.
S09E17,GEORGE,"Hey, me too."
S09E17,WAITRESS,"Yeah, me too."
S09E17,ELAINE,Oh God. Why did I do this? Now I'm the office skank.
S09E17,GEORGE,"Well, unless you tell everybody you're dating."
S09E17,ELAINE,"(Liking the idea) Ohh.. right. Cause if we're dating, what everyone saw was just a beautiful moment between two lovers."

S09E17,NEWMAN,(Gesturing to dishes and silverware on the table) But you can clear some of this stuff out of the way.
S09E17,KRAMER,"Jerry, check this out. (Pointing at some papers on the table) Remember my idea about rickshaws in New Youk? Well, we're gonna make it happen!"
S09E17,JERRY,"(Jokingly trying to be skeptical) No, you're not."
S09E17,KRAMER,"Newman, he knows a guy in the Hong Kong post office.."
S09E17,JERRY,"(Still skeptical) No, he doesn't."
S09E17,NEWMAN,He's shipping us a rickshaw. It can't miss!
S09E17,JERRY,"Yes, it can."
S09E17,KRAMER,"We'll start out with one, and they when it catches on, we're gonna have a whole fleet!"
S09E17,NEWMAN,It's the romance of the Handsome Cab without the guilt or dander of the equine.
S09E17,JERRY,"So, who's gonna pull this thing?"
S09E17,KRAMER,"(To Newman) Well, I just assumed you would."
S09E17,NEWMAN,"Yeah, but I though-"
S09E17,KRAMER,(Stopping his thought) Da-da-da-da no.
S09E17,JERRY,"(Extremely happy about Kramer and Newman's dilemma) My, isn't this an awkward moment?"
S09E17,KRAMER,(Brainstorming) What about the homeless?
S09E17,NEWMAN,Can't we worry about them later?
S09E17,KRAMER,(Explaining) To pull the rickshaw.
S09E17,NEWMAN,(Pondering Kramer's plan out loud) They do have an intimate knowledge of the street..
S09E17,KRAMER,They're always walkin' around the city. Why not just strap something to them?!

S09E17,LEO,I still have the ringing in the ears. Sounds like the phone.
S09E17,JERRY,"(Shrugging his problems off) Yeah, yeah. But what about money? Are you strapped? Do you need a little?"
S09E17,LEO,"What, are you kidding? I should you loaning you money! (Quickly amending what he just said) But I'm not."
S09E17,JERRY,"(Being frank) Leo, I saw you in Brentano's yesterday."
S09E17,LEO,Why didn't ya say hello?
S09E17,JERRY,Because you were too busy stealing a book.
S09E17,LEO,(Giving a courtesy lesson) You still say hello.
S09E17,JERRY,"(Showing that it's a problem) Leo, I saw you steal."
S09E17,LEO,"Oh, they don't care. We all do it."
S09E17,JERRY,"Who, criminals?"
S09E17,LEO,Senior citizens. No big deal.
S09E17,JERRY,You could get arrested.
S09E17,LEO,Arrested? Come on! (Goes into a routine explaination for his stealing) I'm an old man. I'm confused! I thought I paid for it. What's my name? Will you take me home?
S09E17,JERRY,(Pleading) Leo..
S09E17,LEO,"Alright, alright. Mr. Goody Two-Shoes. You made your point."

S09E17,KRAMER,"Alright, listen up. Now, you three have been hand-picked out of possibly dozens that applied. Now, what we're looking for are motivated, hard-working, homeless gentlemen like yourselves to pull rickshaws. (One of the homeless men starts to wander off, walking away) Now, I don't caer where you're from, or how you got here, or what happened to your homes. But you will have to be physically fit."
S09E17,HOMELESS MAN,The government!
S09E17,KRAMER,(Continuing as if nothing happened) Because to pull rickshaws means more than just strong legs. You're also going to need a well-toned upper body.
S09E17,NEWMAN,"Alright, who's first?"
S09E17,KRMAER,Hey.
S09E17,NEWMAN,"Name, please."
S09E17,HOMELESS MAN,Rusty.

S09E17,GEORGE,Oh.
S09E17,REBECCA,"(Opens the cover of the book) Oh, wait a second. (Certain) This book has been in the bathroom."
S09E17,GEORGE,(Nervous) Wh-what are you talking about? That - that's rediculous.
S09E17,REBECCA,"It's been flagged. I know. I used to work in a Brentano's. Mister, we're trying to help the homeless heare - it's bad enough that we have some nut out there trying to strap 'em to a rickshaw!"
S09E17,GEORGE,"(Desperate to get rid of the book) Alright, I, I'll just take fifty. Do - do we have a deal?"
S09E17,REBECCA,"Yeah, and here it is You get your toilet book out of here, and I won't jump over this counter and punch you in the brain!"
S09E17,GEORGE,I could take it in merchandise..
S09E17,REBECCA,(Threatening to hit him) Here I come..
S09E17,[Setting,Bookstore]
S09E17,ELAINE,"So, this book'll tell me how to get puke out of cashmere?"
S09E17,CASHIER,Yeah.
S09E17,ELAINE,Great.
S09E17,JERRY,"(To Elaine) So, the worst is over?"
S09E17,ELAINE,"Yeah. Now I can break up with him. He's clean, and I'm the office hero."
S09E17,JERRY,Seems like you're better at fake relationships than real ones.
S09E17,ELAIEN,"Yeah, huh. I even got an idea out of it. the Detox Poncho."
S09E17,ELAINE,(Leaving Jerry) See ya.
S09E17,JERRY,"(To cashier) I'd like to speak with the manager, please."
S09E17,[Setting,NYC Street]
S09E17,NEWMAN,"Mind your pace, Boy. Chop, chop!"
S09E17,KRAMER,"(Tired) Oh, I can't go on. I gotta take a break. (Sets the rickshaw down - taking a rest)"
S09E17,NEWMAN,"Well, don't tarry. I'm behind schedule as it is."
S09E17,KRAMER,(Stretching) Oh..
S09E17,NEWMAN,(Scared) Boy.. Boy. Kramer!
S09E17,KRAMER,Woah! Wait!
S09E17,NEWMAN,Ahhh! Yaaaahhh!
S09E17,ZACH,"(Optimistic) Well, this is the first day of the rest of my life!"
S09E17,NEWMAN,Waaaaahhhh!
S09E17,[Setting,Bookstore]
S09E17,JERRY,George? What are you doin' here?
S09E17,GEORGE,I can't sell the book. It's been marked.
S09E17,JERRY,(Sarcasticly joking) It certainly has.
S09E17,GEORGE,"So, I'm gonna steal another one, and then return it. That way, everything is even."
S09E17,JERRY,"(Trying to straighten things out) You defile one book, steal another, ask for your money back - and to you that's even?"
S09E17,GEORGE,I'm goin' in!
S09E17,MANAGER,Did you want to speak with the manager?
S09E17,JERRY,Yes. My Uncle Leo was cought shoplifing here the other day..
S09E17,MANAGER,"Yes, Uncle Leo. I remember him. I'm sorry, our policy is we prosecute all shoplifters."
S09E17,JERRY,"(Pleading) Oh, come on. He's just a lonely old man. All old people steal."
S09E17,MANAGER,"That's right. That's why we stopped carrying batteries. Look, I'll be honest with you, we've had a lot of trouble with theft lately - and my boss says I have to make an example to someone."
S09E17,JERRY,So it could be anyone?
S09E17,MANAGER,I.. guess. As long as we catch him in the act.
S09E17,JERRY,That guy! (Pointing at George) Swarm! Swarm!
S09E17,GEORGE,No! Jerry!
S09E18,ALL (singing),Happy birthday to you.
S09E18,WALTER,Thanks.
S09E18,FEMALE WORKER,"Elaine, cake?"
S09E18,ELAINE,"Uh, no, thanks."
S09E18,FEMALE WORKER,It's Walter's special day.
S09E18,ELAINE,"You know, there are 200 people who work in this office. Every day is somebody's special day."
S09E18,MALE WORKER,Elaine! Where're you going? It's Walter's last day. We have to celebrate.
S09E18,ELAINE,It's his birthday and it's his last day?
S09E18,MALE WORKER,"This is other-Walter, from returns."
S09E18,OTHER-WALTER,"Hey, what's going on here?"
S09E18,ALL,Surprise!
S09E18,OTHER-WALTER,Oh guys.
S09E18,OTHER-WALTER,"Elaine, it's my last day. Have a piece."
S09E18,ELAINE,"All right, pile it on."
S09E18,"ALL (singing, competing)",For he's a jolly good fellow...happy birthday to you...for he's a jolly good fellow...birthday to you...which nobody can deny...
S09E18,JERRY,What is so bad about having a little piece of cake?
S09E18,ELAINE,"It is the forced socializing. I mean, just because we work in the same office, why do we have to act like we're friends?"
S09E18,JERRY,Why aren't you there now?
S09E18,ELAINE,"I had to take a sick day. I'm so sick of these people. By the way, I talked to Lisi, and tomorrow night's good for her."
S09E18,JERRY,"You know, I shouldn't go out with a friend of yours. I foresee messiness."
S09E18,ELAINE,"Yeah, you're better off sitting around here, reading comic books, and eating spaghetti at two in the morning.."
S09E18,JERRY,"Hey, speaking of tomato sauce, you want to come with me and George to Mario's Pizza?"
S09E18,ELAINE,Your old high school hangout? Why?
S09E18,JERRY,They're closing. We're going for one last slice.
S09E18,KRAMER,"Hey. All right. Hi. Check it out, official police caution tape. Look at that."
S09E18,KRAMER,"Uh-uh-uh. Step back, son, there's nothing to see here."
S09E18,JERRY,Where did you get this?
S09E18,KRAMER,"Well, I got it from my cop buddy Doug."
S09E18,JERRY,You sure have a lot of friends. How come I never see any of these people?
S09E18,KRAMER,They want to know why they never see you.
S09E18,KRAMER,I'm gonna eat that later.
S09E18,JERRY,So they just gave you this?
S09E18,KRAMER,"Oh no, no,. no. I had to fish around in the evidence room for it. You know, they're all preoccupied, trying to hunt down this new psycho-serial killer, the Lopper. All right, I'll see ya."
S09E18,ELAINE,"Wait a minute, wait a minute. Who is the Lopper?"
S09E18,KRAMER,"Oh, it's no big deal. It's just some guy who's been running around Riverside park-pffff. You know, cutting people's heads off."
S09E18,JERRY,How come I haven't read about this?
S09E18,KRAMER,"Well, you know, the police, they've been having some internal dissension about the name."
S09E18,ELAINE,Really? What're the other titles?
S09E18,KRAMER,"Uh, Headso...uh...The Denogginizer...Son of dad."
S09E18,JERRY,Son of dad?
S09E18,KRAMER,Yeah. That was my suggestion. It's sort of a catchall.
S09E18,GEORGE,Mario's Pizza.
S09E18,GEORGE,"Just as she was. Hey, Mario! Remember us?"
S09E18,MARIO,No.
S09E18,JERRY,We used to come in every day.
S09E18,MARIO,So where ya been? We're tanking here.
S09E18,GEORGE,We'll have 2 slices and 2 grape sodas.
S09E18,MARIO,"Oh, thanks. That'll save us."
S09E18,JERRY,"All right, make it the large sodas."
S09E18,GEORGE,"Hey, Jerry, remember Frogger? I used to be so into this game. Gettin' that frog across the street was my entire life."
S09E18,JERRY,"Yeah. And then you went on to...Well, it's a good game."
S09E18,GEORGE,Double jump! Eat the fly! Eat it!
S09E18,BOY,Thanks a lot.
S09E18,GEORGE,"Ah, beat it, punk."
S09E18,JERRY,"Hey, look at the high score--""G.L.C."" George Louis Costanza. That's not you, is it?"
S09E18,GEORGE,"Yes! 860,000. I can't believe it's still standing. No one has beaten me in like 10 years."
S09E18,JERRY,I remember that night.
S09E18,GEORGE,The perfect combination of Mountain Dew and mozzarella...just the right amount of grease on the joy stick...
S09E18,MARIO,Here's your pizza pea brains.
S09E18,JERRY,I think I remember why we stopped coming here.
S09E18,GEORGE,Yeah.
S09E18,ELAINE (thinking),This pen smells really bad. So why do I keep smelling it? Is it too late for me to go to law school?
S09E18,ELAINE,What is this?
S09E18,MALE WORKER,"You were out sick yesterday, so we got you a get-well cake."
S09E18,FEMALE WORKER,It's carrot. It's good for you.
S09E18,WORKERS (singing),"Get well get well soon, we wish you to get--"
S09E18,ELAINE,"Stop it! That's not even a song! I mean, now we're celebrating a sick day?"
S09E18,MALE WORKER,I think it's nice.
S09E18,ELAINE,"What? What is nice? Trying to fill the void in your life with flour and sugar and egg and vanilla? I mean, we are all unhappy. Do we have to be fat, too? Not you Becky, I know you have a slow metabolism. I don't want one more piece of cake in my office!"
S09E18,WORKER (singing),"Get well, get well soon--"
S09E18,MALE WORKER,It's not happening.
S09E18,BECKY,Can we still it eat?
S09E18,JERRY,"I'll tell you Lisi, I never expected that movie to--"
S09E18,LISI,End under water?
S09E18,JERRY,"Be that long. I mean, most action movies are--"
S09E18,LISI,So much more violent.
S09E18,JERRY,Not as long.
S09E18,LISI,"Well, I should probably--"
S09E18,JERRY,Get going.
S09E18,LISI,Yeah.
S09E18,JERRY,"Well, it was nice meeting you. I'm sure I'll see you--"
S09E18,LISI,Eight tomorrow?
S09E18,JERRY,"Actually, that's--"
S09E18,LISI,What you were thinking.
S09E18,JERRY,Right.
S09E18,GEORGE,"Oh! Here you are. Ha ha...You, uh, you want to--"
S09E18,JERRY,Sure. (points at booth) How about this one?
S09E18,GEORGE,"Well, I'm doing it, Jerry. I'm buying the Frogger machine. Now the torch will burn forever."
S09E18,JERRY,"Fabulous. See, now you're really do something."
S09E18,GEORGE,"So, you want to come down to Mario's Pizza with me and help me pick up the Frogger?"
S09E18,JERRY,"Hey, how you gonna keep the machine plugged in while you move it?"
S09E18,GEORGE,What?
S09E18,JERRY,"Once you unplug the machine, all the scores will be erased."
S09E18,GEORGE,You're right. Why must there always be a problem? You'd think just once I could get a break. God knows I earned it with that score!
S09E18,KRAMER,"Well, more bad news Jerry."
S09E18,KRAMER,"You know the police, they found another victim of the Lopper in Riverside Park. I saw the photo, and it looked a lot like you."
S09E18,JERRY,"Oh, come on. There's a lot of people walking around the city that look like me."
S09E18,KRAMER,Not as many as there used to be.
S09E18,GEORGE,"No. I need a guy that can rig a Frogger machine so that I can move it without losing power, 'cause I have the high score. H-hello?"
S09E18,KRAMER,"You know, George, you're not gonna find an electrician like that in the yellow pages. Now, I know just the guy who can do this."
S09E18,JERRY,Another friend?
S09E18,KRAMER,"Oh, no, no, no. This guy is no friend. In fact, we don't even get along."
S09E18,GEORGE,"Well, is he good, Kramer?"
S09E18,KRAMER,"Oh, he's the best...and the worst."
S09E18,GEORGE,"Kramer, listen to me. I'm never gonna have a child. If I lose this Frogger high score, that's it for me."
S09E18,KRAMER,"Believe me George, you can count on Slippery Pete."
S09E18,GEORGE,Slippery Pete?
S09E18,KRAMER,"Yeah, I don't care for the name, either. In fact, that's one of the things that we argue about."
S09E18,GEORGE,"All right, I'm gonna find a guy with a truck. GLC must live on!"
S09E18,JERRY,Come on.
S09E18,KRAMER,Dng-ga-gng-ga-wt.
S09E18,JERRY,Hello?
S09E18,ELAINE,So how's it going with my friend?
S09E18,JERRY,She's a sentence finisher. It's like dating Mad Libs.
S09E18,JERRY,What is that?
S09E18,ELAINE,"Oh, it's a cake party. It's the third one today. I didn't realize how hooked I got on that 400 sugar rush."
S09E18,JERRY,So join in.
S09E18,ELAINE,I can't. I denounced them. Maybe I'll go raid Peterman's fridge. He's always got a truffle or something in there.
S09E18,JERRY,All right.
S09E18,JERRY,"Hey, wh-what--"
S09E18,KRAMER,Yeah. I dropped an egg. Be careful.
S09E18,ELAINE,Anybody here? Peterboy?
S09E18,ELAINE,"Ooh, it's a cake walk."
S09E18,PETERMAN (singing),"Get well, get well soon we wish you to get well."
S09E18,PETERMAN,"Ha ha ha ha...Oh, what a stirring little anthem of wellness."
S09E18,ELAINE,"Mr. Peterman, um--"
S09E18,PETERMAN,"We missed you at the get well party. Poor old Walt has a polyp in the duodenum. It's benign, but--ooh--still a bastard. Oh, Elaine, can you keep a secret?"
S09E18,ELAINE,"No, sir, I can't."
S09E18,PETERMAN,"Inside that small college boy minifridge is my latest acquisition. A slice of cake from the wedding of King Edward VIII to Wallis Simpson, circa 1937, price--$29,000."
S09E18,JERRY,"Well Lisi, that was another-"
S09E18,LISI,Lovely evening.
S09E18,JERRY,Really bad meal. I was thinking maybe we should--
S09E18,LISI,Go for a hansom cab ride?
S09E18,JERRY,Call it a night. I'll walk you home. Where do you live?
S09E18,LISI,"84th street, right off Riverside Park."
S09E18,JERRY,Riverside Park.
S09E18,LISI,I thought we were going--
S09E18,JERRY,Back to my place. That's right.
S09E18,GEORGE,So you slept with her?
S09E18,JERRY,"She lives right off Riverside Park. I was scared of the Lopper, So I let her stay over."
S09E18,GEORGE,And you automatically sleep with her?
S09E18,JERRY,"Well, I just wanted to make out a little, but she kind of--"
S09E18,GEORGE,Finished your thought.
S09E18,ELAINE,Guess what I ate.
S09E18,GEORGE,An ostrich burger.
S09E18,ELAINE,"No. A $29,000 piece of cake. Peterman got it at The Duke Of Windsor auction. It was the most romantic thing I've ever eaten."
S09E18,JERRY,How'd it taste?
S09E18,ELAINE,A little stale.
S09E18,JERRY,Yeah.
S09E18,GEORGE (nudges Elaine with his elbow),"So, uh are you sleeping with Peterman?"
S09E18,ELAINE (nudges George with her elbow),"No. He doesn't know I ate it. In fact, he almost caught me. I have to sneak back in and even it out."
S09E18,GEORGE,"You know, they say ostrich has less fat, but you eat more of it."
S09E18,ELAINE,"Hey, so I talked to Lisi and she has got a big surprise for you. She's planning a weekend trip to Pennsylvania Dutch country."
S09E18,JERRY,"Pennsylvania Dutch country? Oh, that's the serious relationship weekend place."
S09E18,ELAINE,What is going on with you two?
S09E18,JERRY,"Well, I think by sleeping with her, I may have sent her the wrong message."
S09E18,GEORGE,What's that?
S09E18,ELAINE,400 sugar fix.
S09E18,JERRY,"Well, I'm calling this off right now."
S09E18,ELAINE,"No, no. You are way past the phone call breakup stage."
S09E18,JERRY,"Well, I'm not going over there. That's where the Lopper is."
S09E18,ELAINE,Oh...it's daylight. It won't take you that long. Just make a clean break.
S09E18,ELAINE,Just a little off the side...
S09E18,ELAINE,"Well, no point in wasting $1,200."
S09E18,ELAINE (thinking),"Oh, commander, isn't the wedding marvelous? More cake? Oh, I shouldn't. I mustn't. Ah, what the hell?"
S09E18,GEORGE,"Now, each of you is here because you're the best at what you do."
S09E18,GEORGE,"Slippery Pete, Kramer tells me you are one hell of a rogue electrician. And shlomo, you're the best truck driver."
S09E18,SHLOMO,I don't know If I'm the best.
S09E18,GEORGE,Oh...you're very good.
S09E18,SHLOMO,"Let's say ""good."""
S09E18,GEORGE,"Ok. Good. And Kramer, you're in charge of taping off the loading zone."
S09E18,KRAMER,Lock and load.
S09E18,SLIPPERY PETE,"You think you can handle that, numb nuts?"
S09E18,KRAMER,"All right, all right, come on, now."
S09E18,SLIPPERY PETE,That was my mail-order bride.
S09E18,KRAMER,"Hey, you weren't home, so I signed for her."
S09E18,SLIPPERY PETE,It doesn't give you the right to make out with her.
S09E18,KRAMER,You weren't even married yet.
S09E18,GEORGE,"All right, all right, calm down, calm down. Whatever happened in the past is past."
S09E18,GEORGE,"Now, this is the basic layout for Mario's Pizza."
S09E18,SHLOMO,So what kind of jail time are we looking at if we're caught?
S09E18,GEORGE,What do you mean?
S09E18,SLIPPERY PETE,"We're stealing this thing, right?"
S09E18,GEORGE,No. I--I paid for it.
S09E18,SLIPPERY PETE,I thought we were stealing it.
S09E18,KRAMER,Yeah. It feels like we're stealing it.
S09E18,GEORGE,We're not stealing it.
S09E18,SHLOMO,I definitely thought we're stealing it.
S09E18,GEORGE,"All right, let's--let's focus. Can we get back to the plan?"
S09E18,SLIPPERY PETE,"Well, I need a battery for this kind of a job. Can I at least steal a battery?"
S09E18,GEORGE,"Fine. Steal the battery. Now, all right, here is the Frogger. This is the front door, and this is the outlet."
S09E18,SLIPPERY PETE,What's that?
S09E18,GEORGE,The outlet?
S09E18,SLIPPERY PETE,Mm-hmm.
S09E18,GEORGE,That's where the electricity comes out.
S09E18,SLIPPERT PETE,"Oh, you mean the holes."
S09E18,SHLOMO,Which one's the bathroom?
S09E18,GEORGE,"Uh, here."
S09E18,SHLOMO,They put the Frogger with the toilet? Yecchh.
S09E18,GEORGE,The Frogger is here.
S09E18,KRAMER,"George, I thought that was the door."
S09E18,SLIPPERY PETE,Where are all the pizza ovens?
S09E18,SHLOMO,I thought the bathroom was here.
S09E18,GEORGE,All right. You understand now? It's not that complicated.
S09E18,ELAINE,I need to replace an antique piece of cake.
S09E18,ELAINE,"Do you have anything that's been...you know, laying around for a while? Something prewar would be just great."
S09E18,KRAMER,"Oh, hey, Elaine. What, you got the munchies?"
S09E18,ELAINE,"Oh, Kramer, I am in big. big, big trouble. I need a cake that looks like this."
S09E18,KRAMER,"Oh, yeah--Sotheby's. Yeah. They make good cake."
S09E18,ELAINE,Do any of these look close?
S09E18,KRAMER,"No, but I know I've seen cake just like that. Oh--Entenmann's. Yeah."
S09E18,ELAINE,Entenmann's? From the supermarket?
S09E18,KRAMER,"Well, no. They're not really in the supermarket. Yeah, they got their own case at the end of the aisle."
S09E18,JERRY,"Hi, Lisi."
S09E18,LISI,"Hi, honey. Is that a bat?"
S09E18,JERRY,"Uh, yeah. I found it on the street. It's gotta be worth something."
S09E18,LISI,"So, what do you want to do, Sweetheart?"
S09E18,JERRY,"Well, before we do anything...maybe we should talk."
S09E18,MONTAGE,
S09E18,JERRY,"Then this Pennsylvania Dutch thing comes out of nowhere. I mean, how am I supposed to respond to that?"
S09E18,LISI,Then may I say something... without being interrupted?
S09E18,JERRY,Well I'm sorry if I ruined your life. That's exactly what I set out to do.
S09E18,LISI,Uh-huh. Uh-huh. Mm-hmm. Uh-huh...
S09E18,LISI,Are you afraid to kiss me in public?
S09E18,JERRY,Have we even been in public?
S09E18,LISI,"So now you're going to tell me what I'm thinking. Well, go ahead, 'cause I'd really like to know."
S09E18,JERRY,You are not dumb. Don't say that..
S09E18,JERRY,These beans are pretty good.
S09E18,LISI,20 minutes.
S09E18,JERRY,"Well, I'm sorry I'm not Brad. I'm me!"
S09E18,JERRY,Nice to meet ya!
S09E18,LISI,"Boy, did your mother do a number on you."
S09E18,LISI,Fine. So it's over.
S09E18,JERRY,"Oh, thank god. Why is it dark out? What time is it?"
S09E18,LISI,930.
S09E18,JERRY,We've been breaking up for 10 hours?
S09E18,LISI,"Good-bye, Jerry."
S09E18,JERRY,"Lopper. You know, Lisi, maybe we should give this a little more time. See how it looks in the light of day."
S09E18,LISI,Out!
S09E18,JERRY,Lopper.
S09E18,JERRY,"Lisi, Lisi. Let me in! We can work this out. I was wrong, you were right. I'll do anything!"
S09E18,GEORGE,"Jerry, you came for the big moment."
S09E18,JERRY,No. I'm waiting for...
S09E18,GEORGE,"Ha ha. Everything's timed out to perfection, Jerry. Slippery Pete's got the Frogger running on battery power, the truck will be there any minute, and Kramer's taped out the loading zone."
S09E18,JERRY,Oh. Sounds great.
S09E18,GEORGE,"Yeah, yeah. You gotta come over tonight. We can play."
S09E18,JERRY,"Oh, I can't. I'm busy. I'm going away on a long weekend."
S09E18,GEORGE,Where?
S09E18,LISI,"Look what I found. I got one for you, too."
S09E18,JERRY,"Great. Uh, you know what? Why don't you put it in the car so I don't toss it in that dumpster?"
S09E18,LISI,"Ha ha. Ok. I'll meet thee in front of your place, 15 minutes."
S09E18,JERRY,"A long, long weekend."
S09E18,GEORGE,I hear thee.
S09E18,PETERMAN,"Elaine! Excellent. I'd like you to meet a friend of mine, Irwin Lubeck."
S09E18,ELAINE,"Oh, hello."
S09E18,LUBECK,Charmed.
S09E18,PETERMAN,"All right, brace yourself, Lubeck. You are about to be launched via pastry back to the wedding of one of the most dashing and romantic Nazi sympathizers of the entire British Royal family."
S09E18,ELAINE,I guess I'll just--
S09E18,PETERMAN,"Oh, no Elaine, stay. Lubeck here is the world's foremost appraiser of vintage pastry."
S09E18,PETERMAN,"All right, Lubeck. How much is she worth?"
S09E18,LUBECK,I'd say about 219.
S09E18,PETERMAN,"Ha ha ha ha ha!$219,000! Lubeck, you glorious titwillow. You just made me a profit of $190,000."
S09E18,LUBECK,"No, $2.19. It's an Entenmann's."
S09E18,PETERMAN,Do they have a castle at Windsor?
S09E18,LUBECK,No. They have a display case at the end of the aisle.
S09E18,PETERMAN,"Oh, good lord."
S09E18,LUBECK,"You all right, Peterman? You look ill."
S09E18,ELAINE (singing),"Get well, get well soon, we want you to get well. Get well, get well soon we want you to get well."
S09E18,GEORGE,What are you guys doing?
S09E18,SHLOMO,Eat the fly. Eat the fly. Got him!
S09E18,GEORGE,You idiots. You're gonna wear down the battery.
S09E18,SLIPPERY PETE,"The batteries are fine. We've got...oh, god. only 3 minutes left."
S09E18,GEORGE,Quick. Get this thing back in the pizzeria
S09E18,KRAMER,"George, they closed up."
S09E18,GEORGE,I need an outlet!
S09E18,SLIPPERY PETE,A what?
S09E18,GEORGE,Holes! I need holes!
S09E18,KRAMER,The pharmacy's still open.
S09E18,GEORGE,"All right. Kramer, you block off traffic. You to go sweet-talk the pharmacist."
S09E18,SLIPPERY PETE (to George),You owe me a quarter.
S09E18,GEORGE (to Jerry),"Slippery Pete. Kramer, hurry up!"
S09E18,KRAMER,Ahh! I'm out! No tape left!
S09E18,JERRY,"Well, come on George, I'll help you push it across."
S09E18,GEORGE,Wait a minute. This looks familiar. This reminds me of something. I can do this.
S09E18,JERRY,By yourself?
S09E18,GEORGE,"Jerry, I've been preparing for this moment my entire life."
S09E18,SHLOMO,He looks like a Frog.
S09E18,SLIPPERY PETE,So do you.
S09E18,JERRY,Game over.
S09E18,ELAINE,"Mr. Peterman, you wanted to see me, sir?"
S09E18,PETERMAN,"Elaine, up until a moment ago, I was convinced that I was on the receiving end of one of the oldest baker's grift in the books--The Entenmann's shim-sham."
S09E18,ELAINE,Ohh...
S09E18,PETERMAN,Until I remembered the videotape surveillance system that I installed to catch other-Walter using my latrine. But it also caught this.
S09E18,EALINE,"Mr. Peterman, I, uh..."
S09E18,PETERMAN,"Elaine, I have a question for you. Is the item still...with you?"
S09E18,ELAINE,Um...as far as I know.
S09E18,PETERMAN,Do you know what happens to a butter-based frosting after six decades in a poorly ventilated English basement?
S09E18,ELAINE,"Uh, I guess I hadn't--"
S09E18,PETERMAN,"Well, I have a feeling that what you are about to go through is punishment enough. Dismissed."
S09E19,JERRY (to waitress),Cup of tea with lemon.
S09E19,GEORGE,What happened to your voice?
S09E19,JERRY,I was screamin' at hecklers all night. The last time I open for a rodeo.
S09E19,GEORGE,"Well, Jerry, I been thinkin'. I've gotten as far as I can go with George Costanza."
S09E19,JERRY,Is this the suicide talk or the nickname talk?
S09E19,GEORGE,"The nickname. George. What is that? It's nothing. It's got no snap, no zip. I need a nickname that makes people light up."
S09E19,JERRY,You mean like...Liza!
S09E19,GEORGE,But I was thinking...T-bone.
S09E19,JERRY,"But there's no ""t"" in your name. What about G-bone?"
S09E19,GEORGE,There's no G-bone.
S09E19,JERRY,There's a g-spot.
S09E19,GEORGE,That's a myth.
S09E19,JERRY,"T-bone, the ladies are gonna love ya."
S09E19,ELAINE,Why did they hire you for a rodeo?
S09E19,JERRY,They heard I opened for Kenny Rogers once.
S09E19,ELAINE,Didn't he throw you off a bus in the middle of Alabama or--
S09E19,JERRY,"Oh, I had that comin' to me."
S09E19,ELAINE,"You know, Kenny Rogers has a-"
S09E19,ELAINE (whispering),Why did you get a maid?
S09E19,JERRY,You don't have to whisper. She knows she's a maid.
S09E19,ELAINE,Where did you get her?
S09E19,JERRY,I hired her from a service!
S09E19,MAID,All done.
S09E19,JERRY,Thank you. Nice job.
S09E19,MAID,Is this mine?
S09E19,JERRY,Yeah.
S09E19,JERRY,What?
S09E19,ELAINE,"Come on, Jerry. You didn't notice?"
S09E19,JERRY,Notice what? She's not really even a maid.
S09E19,ELAINE,Oh.
S09E19,JERRY,"She wants to be an actress...or a, uh, model...or a dancer...or a...news woman."
S09E19,ELAINE,Uh-huh. News woman. Yeah.
S09E19,KRAMER,"Hey. Well, bad news, boys. My life is over. My girlfriend's movin' away."
S09E19,JERRY,You have a girlfriend?
S09E19,KRAMER,"Jerry, where have you been?"
S09E19,JERRY,At a rodeo. Where's she moving?
S09E19,KRAMER,Downtown.
S09E19,ELAINE,Downtown New York?
S09E19,KRAMER,Yeah. I don't know if I can handle one of these long-distance relationships.
S09E19,JERRY,It's like 10 minutes by subway.
S09E19,KRAMER,I don't know.
S09E19,KRAMER,"Oh! Jeez! Well, you've got a maid. It's a whole different world downtown-- different Gap, different Tower Records, and she's a 646."
S09E19,ELAINE,What? What is that?
S09E19,JERRY,"That's the new area code. They've run out of 242s, so all the new numbers are 646."
S09E19,ELAINE,I was a 718 when I first moved here. I cried every night.
S09E19,KRAMER,"Listen. Heads up, Elaine. I'm gonna have to stop by later and pick up a fax."
S09E19,ELAINE,At work?
S09E19,KRAMER,No. At your apartment.
S09E19,ELAINE,I don't have a fax machine.
S09E19,JERRY,Here we go.
S09E19,KRAMER,"Well, now what are we gonna do? (to Jerry) See? This is why you should get a fax and a Xerox."
S09E19,JERRY,And a dead bolt.
S09E19,ELAINE,Then maybe you have a fax machine.
S09E19,KRAMER,You just blew my mind.
S09E19,KRUGER,Let's order lunch.
S09E19,KRUGER,"Mary, I will have a chef's salad."
S09E19,MALE WORKER,Turkey sandwich.
S09E19,GEORGE,T-bone steak.
S09E19,KRUGER,For lunch?
S09E19,GEORGE,"Well, I am just a T-bone kinda guy. Love that T-bone. In fact, you might as well call me--"
S09E19,WATKINS,"That sounds good. I'll have one, too."
S09E19,KRUGER,"Watkins, you're havin' a T-bone?"
S09E19,WATKINS,I love 'em.
S09E19,KRUGER,"Well, then we should call you T-bone."
S09E19,GEORGE,"Uh, no. No, we shouldn't."
S09E19,KRUGER,T-bone!
S09E19,ALL (chanting),T-bone! T-bone! T-bone! T-bone! T-bone! T-bone! T-bone! T-bone!
S09E19,ELAINE,Hello?
S09E19,ELAINE,What?
S09E19,MACHINE,You have 57 messages. Message one...
S09E19,MACHINE,Message two...
S09E19,MACHINE,Message three...
S09E19,GEORGE,"Hey, it's George. Listen, I-"
S09E19,MACHINE,Message four...
S09E19,EALINE,Hello?
S09E19,ELAINE,Aah!
S09E19,JERRY,"Well Cindy, the place looks great."
S09E19,CINDY,"Thanks Jerry, gotta run."
S09E19,JERRY,"Ok, I'll see ya."
S09E19,CINDY,"Hi, Elaine."
S09E19,ELAINE,All right! You're foolin' around with your maid. That is a wise decision.
S09E19,JERRY,"Elaine, do you think I would go willy-nilly into a situation so obviously fraught with potential complications?"
S09E19,ELAINE,You are paying a woman to come to your house and sleep with you.
S09E19,JERRY,No. I pay her to clean. The rest is--
S09E19,ELAINE,What? A health plan?
S09E19,JERRY,"I was going to say, ""Being a good host."""
S09E19,ELAINE,Oh-ho-ho. Oh.
S09E19,JERRY,"But the point is we have our personal relationship, and we have our work relationship. They're separate and, I think, some what sophisticated."
S09E19,ELAINE,So you consider this a relationship?
S09E19,JERRY,"Yes, I do."
S09E19,ELAINE,Oh. Have you been out?
S09E19,JERRY,"Yes, we have."
S09E19,ELAINE,Where did you go?
S09E19,JERRY,The store.
S09E19,ELAINE,Mm! To get what?
S09E19,JERRY,Stuff.
S09E19,ELAINE,Cleaning supplies?
S09E19,JERRY,And gum.
S09E19,ELAINE,"Oh. Well, there's nothin' more sophisticated than diddlin' the maid and then chewin' some gum."
S09E19,JERRY,She's not a maid. She might be a news woman!
S09E19,KRAMER,"Hey. Well, I just saw Madeline off. Yeah. She's in a cab and--nguh nguh nguh--on her way. I miss her already."
S09E19,ELAINE,"Hey, Kramer, what was it you were having faxed to my house every 30 seconds?"
S09E19,KRAMER,"Well, I signed up for a food delivery service, Now We're Cookin'. That's a play on words. You know, they're faxing me the menus from some restaurants."
S09E19,ELAINE,Which ones?
S09E19,KRAMER,"Well, all of them. It's the deluxe package."
S09E19,ELAINE,So this is never gonna stop?
S09E19,KRAMER,"Well, it better not. Paid for the whole year. So, should I pick those up later?"
S09E19,ELAINE,You can pick 'em up right now.
S09E19,KRAMER,Ah!
S09E19,ELAINE (thinking),I wonder if anyone knows he's here. If he just disappeared...would anybody notice?
S09E19,PHONE MAN,"All right, miss Benes, all finished. Here's your new number."
S09E19,ELAINE,Ahem. 646? What is this?
S09E19,PHONE MAN,That's your new area code.
S09E19,ELAINE,I thought 646 was just for new numbers.
S09E19,PHONE MAN,This is a new number.
S09E19,ELAINE,"No, no, no, no. It's not a new number. It's--it's--it's just a changed number. See? It's not different. It's the same, just...changed."
S09E19,PHONE MAN,"Look, I work for the phone company. I've had a lot of experience with semantics, so don't try to lure me into some maze of circular logic."
S09E19,ELAINE,"You know, I could've killed you, and no one would've known."
S09E19,PHONE MAN,"I could've killed you, and no one would've known."
S09E19,JERRY,"Kramer, you're still on the phone?"
S09E19,KRAMER,"Madeline and I are watching Quincy together. Jerry, you know this comes on at the same time here as it does there?"
S09E19,JERRY,Really? It's Tuesday here. What day is it there?
S09E19,KRAMER (into phone),"Jerry's teasing. Uh-oh! Commercial. Oh, you going to the bathroom? Yeah. I'll go, too."
S09E19,JERRY,Madeline stays here.
S09E19,JERRY,"Hey, T-bone!"
S09E19,GEORGE,No. No T-bone.
S09E19,JERRY,No T-bone?
S09E19,KRAMER (from bathroom),"Hey, is that T-bone?!"
S09E19,JERRY,No! There's no T-bone!
S09E19,KRAMER,"Well, why no T-bone?!"
S09E19,JERRY,Why no T-bone?
S09E19,GEORGE,'Cause Neil Watkins from accounting is T-bone!
S09E19,KRAMER,"Oh, yeah I'm back. Hey, you wanna play cards over the phone?"
S09E19,KRAMER,"Oh, hey, uh, listen, Jerry, uh, laundry's pilin' up there. You might want to tell your girlfriend. Mmm. Yeah."
S09E19,GEORGE,Your girlfriend is doin' your laundry?
S09E19,KRAMER (from hallway),He's sleeping with his maid!
S09E19,GEORGE,You're sleepin' with the maid?
S09E19,JERRY,Yes.
S09E19,GEORGE,I've done that. Did you ever eat an ostrich burger?
S09E19,JERRY,No.
S09E19,MAN,You're probably one of those women who doesn't like to give out her number.
S09E19,ELAINE,"No, I'm not. Here you go."
S09E19,MAN,646?
S09E19,ELAINE,It's a new area code.
S09E19,MAN,What area? New Jersey?
S09E19,ELAINE,"No, no. It's right here in the city. It's the same as 212. They just multiplied it by 3, and then they added one to the middle number. It's the same."
S09E19,MAN,Do I have to dial a one first?
S09E19,MAN,I'm really kinda seein' somebody.
S09E19,ELAINE,"Yeah? Well, so am I!"
S09E19,GEORGE,"Excuse me. Can I talk to you for a second there, Watkins?"
S09E19,WATKINS,It's T-bone.
S09E19,GEORGE,The thing is...I'm supposed to be T-bone.
S09E19,WATKINS,Heh heh. You're not a T-bone. You're a perfect George.
S09E19,GEORGE,"What? Now, you listen to me!"
S09E19,KRUGER,"Hey, look at George. He's givin' it to T-bone. He's jumpin' up and down like some kind of monkey. Hey, what was the name of that monkey that could read sign language?"
S09E19,WATKINS,"All right, you can have T-bone. Stop crying."
S09E19,GEORGE (sniffling),I'm not crying. And I shouldn't have said that about your wife. Please accept my apologies.
S09E19,GEORGE,"Ok, everybody, uh...I have an announcement to make. From now on, I will be known as-"
S09E19,KRUGER,Koko the monkey.
S09E19,GEORGE,What?
S09E19,ALL (chanting),Koko! Koko! Koko! Koko! Koko! Koko! Koko! Koko! Koko! Koko!
S09E19,MAN,Thank you both for being here.
S09E19,EALINE,"Um, excuse me. I live in the building. Did something happen to Mrs. Krantz?"
S09E19,MAN,She passed.
S09E19,ELAINE,"Oh, I'm so sorry."
S09E19,MAN,Thank you.
S09E19,ELAINE,A quick question-- did she by any chance have a 212 phone number?
S09E19,CINDY,"I can't find my earring. Oh, here it is."
S09E19,KRAMER,"Hey, listen, can I borrow your suitcases?"
S09E19,JERRY,Yeah. It's in your closet.
S09E19,KRAMER,"No, no, no. I looked."
S09E19,JERRY,They're behind my skis and my tennis racket.
S09E19,KRAMER,"Thanks, buddy."
S09E19,JERRY,Where you goin'?
S09E19,KRAMER,"Huh? Well, I'm gettin' out of town. I'm gonna visit Madeline for the weekend. You know, this place is lookin' kinda messy. What happened to Cindy?"
S09E19,JERRY,"Well, she's here. She just didn't get around to it."
S09E19,KRAMER,Oh.
S09E19,CINDY,"Hi, Kramer."
S09E19,CINDY,"Thanks, Jerry. Bye."
S09E19,KRAMER,"Well, what's the matter?"
S09E19,JERRY,What did I just pay for?
S09E19,KRAMER,Uh-oh. You're a john.
S09E19,JERRY,Koko?
S09E19,GEORGE,Koko.
S09E19,JERRY,"Well, it's probably the most intelligent ape there is."
S09E19,GEORGE,"Yeah. So, how's Cindy the maid?"
S09E19,JERRY,"Well, everything's goin' great except, basically, I'm payin' for sex."
S09E19,GEORGE,"Tell me about it. I went out with this girl last week. First I had to pay for dinner, then--"
S09E19,JERRY,"No, George. She's coming over and not cleaning. It's like I'm seein' a prostitute."
S09E19,GEORGE,How much you pay this maid?
S09E19,JERRY,40.
S09E19,GEORGE,"40? I'm payin' 60 to my maid. She doesn't do laundry and I'm gettin' nothin'. All right. Once she pinched my ass, but I don't know what that was."
S09E19,JERRY,I don't know what this is.
S09E19,KRAMER,"Hey, hey, hey. Look at that."
S09E19,JERRY,Ooh.
S09E19,KRAMER,"Jerry, you wouldn't believe what it's like down there. Taxicab drivers are insane. You know, everybody is in a hurry."
S09E19,GEORGE,I can't eat with you leanin' over like this. Just look straight forward.
S09E19,KRAMER,"Well, now I can't see Jerry."
S09E19,JERRY,I look about the same.
S09E19,GEORGE,What?
S09E19,JERRY,I was talking to him.
S09E19,KRAMER,What?
S09E19,JERRY,Never mind.
S09E19,KRAMER,Come on. What'd he say?
S09E19,GEORGE,Never mind.
S09E19,KRAMER,"Jerry, come on. What'd you say?"
S09E19,JERRY,What?
S09E19,KRAMER,Come on. Where'd you go?
S09E19,JERRY,Go back.
S09E19,KRAMER,Eh! Come on. What did you say?
S09E19,JERRY,"I said, never mind."
S09E19,KRAMER,"Yeah. I know that. Uh, uh."
S09E19,JERRY,I hate the counter.
S09E19,ELAINE,Hey.
S09E19,JERRY,Hey.
S09E19,ELAINE,I hate the counter.
S09E19,KRAMER,Who's that?
S09E19,ELAINE (to Jerry),"Well, I got a 212 number from this little old lady in my building-- Mrs. Krantz."
S09E19,JERRY,"Oh, she didn't mind?"
S09E19,ELAINE,No. She died.
S09E19,JERRY,"Hey, that's great."
S09E19,GEORGE,What happened to Mrs. Krantz?
S09E19,JERRY,Elaine got a new number because she died.
S09E19,KRAMER,Newman died?
S09E19,ELAINE,What did he say?
S09E19,JERRY,Some new kind of pie.
S09E19,GEORGE,I'll try a piece.
S09E19,KRAMER,"All right, who's down there?"
S09E19,JERRY,"Hey, there's a booth."
S09E19,KRAMER,"Hey, Elaine."
S09E19,ELAINE,"Oh, hi."
S09E19,KRAMER,Did you hear about Newman?
S09E19,ELAINE,What?
S09E19,GEORGE,Hey.
S09E19,JERRY,So how's it goin' at work? They get tired of it?
S09E19,GEORGE,"Oh, yeah."
S09E19,JERRY,Double zero?
S09E19,GEORGE,"It's ""ooh"" As in ""ooh ooh ah ah."""
S09E19,CINDY,Your nickname's Koko? One of the girls down at the maid service is named Coco.
S09E19,GEORGE,Really? Coco?
S09E19,CINDY,Yeah. Coco. That girl's all right.
S09E19,GEORGE,"You know, if I could get this Coco woman down to Kruger, they wouldn't be able to call me Koko anymore because Kruger would never allow 2 Kokos."
S09E19,JERRY,Sounds like he runs a real tight ship.
S09E19,GEORGE,Say good-bye to Koko.
S09E19,JERRY,"Good-bye, Koko."
S09E19,KRAMER,"Bye, Koko. Whew! Jerry, this relationship is killing me. The distance, the longing, the distance, the-- you know, I didn't realize it, but I'm a needy person."
S09E19,JERRY,"Kramer, maybe this relationship isn't for you."
S09E19,KRAMER,"Oh, yeah? So what am I supposed to do, be more like you? All sealed up in here, emotionally unavailable, paying scrubwomen for sexual favors! No! Jerry, I won't be like you! Never! I'll never be like you!"
S09E19,CINDY,What was that?
S09E19,JERRY,I didn't hear anything.
S09E19,CINDY,"All right, I'm takin' off. Aren't you forgetting something?"
S09E19,JERRY,"Oh, right! Hey, it was great seeing you again. I love your outfit."
S09E19,CINDY,No. My money.
S09E19,JERRY,For what?
S09E19,CINDY,For my maid services. You booked me for today.
S09E19,JERRY,But you didn't really do any work.
S09E19,CINDY,I made the bed.
S09E19,JERRY,But you took a nap in it.
S09E19,CINDY,So?
S09E19,JERRY,I thought that was kind of girlfriend bed making.
S09E19,CINDY,No. That was the maid.
S09E19,JERRY,"Well, who took the nap?"
S09E19,CINDY,The girlfriend.
S09E19,JERRY,$40 seems kind of steep for a nap.
S09E19,CINDY,"So, what are you saying? That I'm a bad maid or some kind of a prostitute?"
S09E19,JERRY,"Ho, ho...ho! Hold on. Let's keep this sophisticated."
S09E19,CINDY,"You know, I don't think I want to be your girlfriend or your maid."
S09E19,JERRY,So is this a breakup/quitting?
S09E19,CINDY,Yeah. Don't ever call me or hire me again.
S09E19,JERRY,"Oh, yeah? Well, then, we're through! And you're fired!"
S09E19,PHONE MAN,Sign here.
S09E19,ELAINE,Yes! 212.
S09E19,ELAINE,"Hey, what happened to the guy I had last time?"
S09E19,PHONE MAN,"Oh, you know, it's an odd thing. He went out on a job and never came back. Nobody knows what happened."
S09E19,ELAINE,All right! I am back in the game.
S09E19,ELAINE,Hello?
S09E19,BOY,Gammy!
S09E19,ELAINE,"No. You got the wrong number, kid."
S09E19,BOY,"Gammy Krantz, it's your grandson Bobby. Why haven't you called?"
S09E19,ELAINE,Oh...nuts.
S09E19,BOY,Do you hate me 'cause of my lazy eye?
S09E19,ELAINE,No. It's just that I've been kind of buried over here.
S09E19,JERRY,So the kid doesn't know his grandmother is dead? G-5?
S09E19,ELAINE,Hit. No. I guess his parents didn't want to tell him. B-2?
S09E19,JERRY,Miss.
S09E19,ELAINE,He called 6 times yesterday. What a nightmare it must be to have a real family.
S09E19,JERRY,I wouldn't worry about it. B-6?
S09E19,ELAINE,Hit. Uhh...you sank my submarine.
S09E19,JERRY,Elaine...
S09E19,JERRY,Hello?
S09E19,COMPUTER VOICE,You have a collect call from--
S09E19,KRAMER,"Hey, buddy, don't say no!"
S09E19,JERRY,I accept.
S09E19,KRAMER,"I went down to Madeline's. I told her, ""You gotta move, or it's over."""
S09E19,JERRY,"Well, what happened?"
S09E19,KRAMER,"I think it's over. We had a big fight, she threw me out, I started walkin', and now I'm lost downtown! I don't have any money. I don't recognize anybody. I miss home, and I don't even know how to get there."
S09E19,JERRY,What's around you?
S09E19,KRAMER,I'm lookin' at Ray's Pizza. You know where that is?
S09E19,JERRY,Is it Famous Ray's?
S09E19,KRAMER,No. It's Original Ray's.
S09E19,JERRY,Famous Original Ray's?
S09E19,KRAMER,"It's just Original, Jerry!"
S09E19,JERRY,"Well, what street are you on?"
S09E19,KRAMER,"Hey, I'm on first and first. How can the same street intersect with itself? I must be at the nexus of the universe."
S09E19,JERRY,"Just wait there. I'll pick you up, and, Kramer, stay alive no matter what occurs, I will find you!"
S09E19,KRAMER,Aah!
S09E19,MAN,You Steinfeld?
S09E19,JERRY,Yeah.
S09E19,MAN,My name is Maxwell. I'm from Maid To Order. It's a pun. I sent one of my girls over to your place.
S09E19,JERRY,Cindy.
S09E19,MAN,She says she had a little problem with you. You didn't pay.
S09E19,JERRY,"You know, she didn't really do what she was supposed to do."
S09E19,MAN,"Oh, yeah? She told me what you like. You're a little sickie, aren't you? Disinfectant on the blinds, vacuuming the counter--"
S09E19,JERRY,"Hey, come on. Come on. I gotta live around here."
S09E19,MAN,You know what I do to people who stiff me on a job?
S09E19,JERRY,What?
S09E19,MAN,"Well, it kinda depends on the situation, but if I don't get my money from you, I'm gonna get it from her."
S09E19,JERRY,I don't want to make trouble. You want the money? Here.
S09E19,MAN,"Hey! Wait, wait, wait! Whoa! Give it to the girl. I'm an independent contractor. Tax purposes."
S09E19,ELAINE,"Bobby, you gotta stop calling your Gammy. Why? Because sometimes you call very early in the morning when Gammy has been out late the night before and sometimes when Gammy's not alone. Your parents still haven't said anything to you about your Gammy? (sighs) All right, here we go. (coughing) Gammy doesn't feel so good. I think Gammy might be dying. Yep. Yep. Ok. Good-bye, Bobby. Don't call anymore. I'm dead now. Gotta go."
S09E19,BOBBY,9-1-1.
S09E19,JERRY,"Nexus of the universe. Hey, Cindy. Cindy."
S09E19,CINDY,What do you want?
S09E19,JERRY,Here. I got your money.
S09E19,CINDY,I don't want any money from you.
S09E19,JERRY,Come on. Take it. It's money. Let me give it to ya.
S09E19,POLICE,"Looking for a good time, sir? You wanna step out of the car, sickie?"
S09E19,JERRY,"Well, this is all very sophisticated."
S09E19,FIREMAN,"All right, hang on, Gammy! You're gonna make it!"
S09E19,ELAINE,Aah!
S09E19,MAXWELL,"Hey, you look a little lost. You from around here?"
S09E19,KRAMER,"Uh, no."
S09E19,MAXWELL,You know where you're going?
S09E19,KRAMER,"Not really. My friend was supposed to pick me up, but I don't know where he is."
S09E19,MAXWELL,Doesn't sound like much of a friend. You got any money?
S09E19,KRAMER,"Uh, no."
S09E19,MAXWELL,You wanna make some?
S09E19,KRAMER,Ok.
S09E19,MAXWELL,Do you know how to use a mop wringer?
S09E19,KRAMER,"Yeah, yeah."
S09E19,MAXWELL,Why don't you get in the car?
S09E19,KRAMER,Hi. Ahh...these are soft seats.
S09E19,KRUGER,"Hey, Koko, Who's this?"
S09E19,GEORGE,"This is our new Vice-president of Acquisitions, sir."
S09E19,KRUGER,"So you're just hiring new people now? That's your job, to hire people?"
S09E19,GEORGE,Yes?
S09E19,KRUGER,"Ok, good enough for me, Koko."
S09E19,KRUGER,"Ahem. Now, what's your name?"
S09E19,COCO,My name is Coco. Coco Higgins.
S09E19,GEORGE,Coco?
S09E19,KRUGER,We can't have 2 Cocos. So I guess you're back to being George.
S09E19,GEORGE,"Well, it was a hell of a ride."
S09E19,KRUGER,"All right, the Grace building. There's a big stain on the front. How do we get it off?"
S09E19,COCO,"When I was a little girl in Jamaica, my Gammy taught me to take a wet rag and in a circ--"
S09E19,GEORGE,"Ah, excuse me, Vice-president Coco, no one cares about your Gammy."
S09E19,COCO,What did you say about my Gammy?
S09E19,GEORGE,Forget Gammy.
S09E19,KRUGER,Who's Gammy?
S09E19,GEORGE,There's no Gammy.
S09E19,KRUGER,Maybe there should be a Gammy.
S09E19,GEORGE,"Oh, no."
S09E19,KRUGER,George.
S09E19,ALL (chanting),Gammy! Gammy! Gammy! Gammy! Gammy! Gammy! Gammy!
S09E19,GEORGE,Gammy's gettin' upset!
S09E20,GEORGE,"Man, I'm starving."
S09E20,ELAINE,How can you be hungry after what you ate at that Mets game?
S09E20,GEORGE,Because ballpark food doesn't count as real food.
S09E20,JERRY,Right. It's just an activity. It's like that paddle with the ball and the rubber band.
S09E20,KRAMER,"You know, my friend Bob Saccamano made a fortune off of those. See he came up with the idea for the rubber band. Before that, people would just hit the ball, and it would fly away."
S09E20,JERRY,I can't believe you all made me leave before the end of the game.
S09E20,ELAINE,"Oh, come on, Jerry. It was 9 to nothing. We were getting shellacked."
S09E20,GEORGE,Those nachos are killing me.
S09E20,ELAINE,I thought you were hungry.
S09E20,GEORGE,It's complicated.
S09E20,KRAMER,"Come on, Jerry, you're going to miss the exit."
S09E20,JERRY,Keep your shirt on. I got it.
S09E20,ELAINE,Watch out for that maroon Golf.
S09E20,KRAMER,"Oh, boy."
S09E20,JERRY,Look at this guy. He's trying to box me out.
S09E20,KRAMER,"I'll tell you when you can go. Wait, wait, wait, Wait-- now, now, now. No, no, no. Go, go! No, no. Wait-- now, now! Now! Jerry! Go--ahh..."
S09E20,JERRY,"Oh, calm down, maroon Golf. He thinks I cut him off. He accelerated."
S09E20,KRAMER,"You want me to moon him? Ooh, let's moon him. Roll up your window. Let's do a pressed ham under glass."
S09E20,ELAINE,"Oh, no, I couldn't do that."
S09E20,KRAMER,"Look at this, look at this. He's giving us the finger."
S09E20,ELAINE,"Oh, all right."
S09E20,KRAMER,Yeah.
S09E20,GEORGE,So I saw that new movie about the Hindenburg.
S09E20,ELAINE,"Oh, yeah. What's that called?"
S09E20,GEORGE,Blimp The Hindenburg Story.
S09E20,JERRY,How was it?
S09E20,GEORGE,I found it morose. Why dwell on these negative themes?
S09E20,JERRY,Yeah. They should make a movie about all the Hindenburg flights that made it.
S09E20,GEORGE,"Anyway, right in the middle, the ship blows up-- burning debris, bodies falling-- and then just as this eerie silence settles over the airfield, I yelled out, ""That's gotta hurt!"""
S09E20,JERRY,Heh.
S09E20,GEORGE,The place went nuts.
S09E20,JERRY,Imagine the laugh you could have gotten if you'd yelled that out at the actual disaster.
S09E20,GEORGE,Yeah.
S09E20,KRAMER,Why are we slowing down?
S09E20,JERRY,What is that music?
S09E20,GEORGE,What's with all these flags?
S09E20,JERRY,"Oh, no."
S09E20,ELAINE AND JERRY,It's the Puerto Rican Day parade!
S09E20,ELAINE,"Ohh! Oh, the city shuts down Fifth avenue. They never let anyone through. We're never getting home."
S09E20,KRAMER,All right. I'm gonna check it out. Aiee. mucho trafico.
S09E20,[STOCK FOOTAGE,Puerto Rican Day parade.]
S09E20,KRAMER,"Yeah...uhh...well, the streets are all blocked. I think every Puerto Rican in the world is out here."
S09E20,PUERTO RICAN MAN,"Well, it is our day."
S09E20,KRAMER,Whoo. Wrong car. Sorry.
S09E20,RADIO,And the Mets score two in the eighth inning.
S09E20,JERRY,"See? If we had stayed, we could have seen those runs."
S09E20,GEORGE,I could have had some ice cream. I think that might have calmed down the nachos.
S09E20,ELAINE,"I'm going to miss 60 Minutes. You know, I hate to miss 60 Minutes. It's part of my Sunday weekend wind-down."
S09E20,JERRY,I don't know how you can unwind with that clock ticking. It makes me anxious.
S09E20,KRAMER,"All right, gentlemen, I scouted it out. I think we can get out over there."
S09E20,JERRY,"But that's a one-way street coming this way. Besides, how am I gonna get all the way over there?"
S09E20,GEORGE,Just inch over. You worm your way.
S09E20,ELAINE,"Just do it, Jerry. Uhh. This exhaust. I'm gonna throw up."
S09E20,KRAMER,"You know, you should make yourself throw up."
S09E20,ELAINE,Huh?
S09E20,KRAMER,You know you're going to.
S09E20,JERRY,"All right, I'm worming."
S09E20,KRAMER,"Hey, Jerry. You know who the grand marshal is of this thing? None other than Miss Chita Rivera."
S09E20,JERRY,They're not letting me in.
S09E20,GEORGE,My hand is out.
S09E20,JERRY,"Well, I think we're gonna need more than a hand. They have to see a human face."
S09E20,ELAINE,You sure you want his face?
S09E20,KRAMER,"No, no, no. It was Mara Conchita Alonso."
S09E20,GEORGE,This guy's giving me the stare-ahead.
S09E20,JERRY,The stare-ahead. I hate that. I use it all the time.
S09E20,GEORGE,Look at me! I am man! I am you!
S09E20,GEORGE,"All right, he's letting you in. Thank you! Creep."
S09E20,KRAMER,Oh! I know who it is. Stacy Keach.
S09E20,JERRY,One more lane to go.
S09E20,GEORGE,All right! We're here!
S09E20,LAMAR,"Oh, look who's here. My old buddy, black Saab."
S09E20,JERRY,Maroon Golf.
S09E20,LAMAR,"Where you goin', black Saab? You seem to be a tad askew."
S09E20,JERRY,Could you move your car back a little?
S09E20,LAMAR,Oh. Sorry. I seem to have cut you off.
S09E20,ELAINE,"All right, I think I know where this is going, and I am going somewhere else."
S09E20,JERRY,You can't do that. You can't just leave the group.
S09E20,ELAINE,I've been trying to leave this group for 10 years. Vaya con dios.
S09E20,KRAMER,"Con dios? Well, that's rude."
S09E20,JERRY,Can you believe her?
S09E20,GEORGE,Yeah. I'll see you later.
S09E20,JERRY,Where are you going?
S09E20,GEORGE,The movies. Blimp is playing right there.
S09E20,JERRY,You're going to that again? Why? Just to do that stupid line?
S09E20,GEORGE,"It's a performance, Jerry. Like what you do."
S09E20,JERRY,That's not what I do.
S09E20,GEORGE,Isn't it?
S09E20,JERRY,"Maybe a little. Ah, hell, I guess it is."
S09E20,KRAMER,"You know, actually, Jerry, you haven't worked a room that big in a while."
S09E20,[STOCK FOOTAGE,Taxis stuck in traffic].
S09E20,ELAINE,Look at that guy's dog. I hate it when their ears get flipped inside out like that. Why doesn't he fix it?
S09E20,ELAINE (yelling),Hey! Fold your dog's ear back!
S09E20,ELAINE,Ooh! This isn't moving! I could walk faster than this.
S09E20,CAB DRIVER,"No, you can't."
S09E20,ELAINE,"Yes, I can. Here. I'm outta here."
S09E20,ELAINE,"Oh, now it's moving. Oh, yeah. I knew it. Hey! Hey!"
S09E20,CAB DRIVER,Where to?
S09E20,ELAINE,That's cute. That's really cute. Oh! Come on! All right. Bye again.
S09E20,ELAINE,Hey. Taxi! Taxi!
S09E20,GEORGE,"Ladies. I, uh, I haven't seen this before."
S09E20,LADY 1,What is that dot?
S09E20,LADY 2,"Oh, I think someone has one of those funny laser pointers."
S09E20,LASER GUY,Gimme a box of those and one of those.
S09E20,GEORGE,"Excuse me, are you the guy with that funny laser?"
S09E20,LASER GUY,The laser's not funny. I'm funny.
S09E20,GEORGE,"Yeah. The thing is, I, uh...I had this little zinger of my own I wanted to try."
S09E20,LASER GUY,Uh-huh.
S09E20,GEORGE,"It's right in the explosion scene. So if you could just...leave me a little window. You know, my, uh, my aunt had a thing removed with a laser. All right, I don't want to interrupt your meal, so..."
S09E20,JERRY,"I've gotta see this game. If it wasn't for this guy, we could get out of here."
S09E20,LAMAR,"This traffic's a killer, ain't it?"
S09E20,KRAMER,"You want to get outta here? Here's what we do. We leave the car here, we take the plates off, we scratch the serial number off the engine block, and we walk away."
S09E20,JERRY,Walk away?
S09E20,KRAMER,"You've got insurance. You tell them that the car was stolen, and then you get another one free."
S09E20,JERRY,Isn't there a deductible?
S09E20,KRAMER,"All right, what is your deductible?"
S09E20,JERRY,I don't know.
S09E20,KRAMER,"Yes, because they've already deducted it."
S09E20,JERRY,From what?
S09E20,KRAMER,"The car, which we're leaving. So the net is zero. See you pocket the money, if there is any, and you get a new car."
S09E20,JERRY,We're not leaving the car!
S09E20,KRAMER,"All right. If you refuse to grow up and scam your insurance company, you'll have to work this out with maroon Golf."
S09E20,JERRY,Absolutely not. He sped up.
S09E20,RADIO,"Swung on, line hard toward left center field. That's in the gap, that's a base hit."
S09E20,JERRY,I'm ready to talk.
S09E20,LADY 1,Hey! There's that laser guy again.
S09E20,LADY 2,He's funny. I never meet anyone funny.
S09E20,LADY 1,I know. A sense of humor is so much more important to me than looks or hair.
S09E20,LADY 2,"Mmm, yeah."
S09E20,GEORGE,That's gotta hurt!
S09E20,GEORGE,It's...gotta hurt! Hurt! Because...Aaarrrrrgh!
S09E20,GEORGE,"Damn you, laser guy! You had to grab it all with your lowbrow laser shtick! You're just a prop comic! Where's the craft?!"
S09E20,LADY 1,Look! It's on the bald guy.
S09E20,LADY 2,I am so glad we came to this showing.
S09E20,KRAMER,"Ok, here's the deal. He wants you to acknowledge that you cut him off with an ""I am sorry"" wave."
S09E20,JERRY,What's that?
S09E20,KRAMER,"You raise the hand, lower the head-- ""I'm sorry, I'm sorry. The buttons are really big on the car. I don't understand it. I haven't read the manual. Ooh!"" You get my drift."
S09E20,JERRY,Ok!
S09E20,LAMAR,Hallelujah. Praise the lord. But I'll take it.
S09E20,KRAMER,"Yes! All right, Lamar, back it up a little bit so we can get out now."
S09E20,GEORGE,"All right. At last, we're finally gettin' out of here."
S09E20,JERRY,What's that on your forehead?
S09E20,GEORGE,It's probably chocolate.
S09E20,JERRY,"Hey, is that one of those laser pointers?"
S09E20,KRAMER,"Hey, Jerry, crank up the Floyd. It's a George laserium!"
S09E20,GEORGE,"All right, stop it! Stay away from my breasts! Chest!"
S09E20,JERRY,"See ya around maroon Golf. And, by the way, that was an ""I'm not sorry"" wave."
S09E20,LAMAR,What was that?
S09E20,JERRY,"I'm glad I cut you off, because black Saab rules! So long, jackass!"
S09E20,JERRY,Elaine?!
S09E20,ELAINE,Jerry?!
S09E20,LAMAR,Jackass? So I'm a jackass now?
S09E20,JERRY,"So if everyone would just put their cars in reverse at the same time, we can do this. All right, on the count of three. Can everyone hear me? Hey, amigo, are you paying attention?"
S09E20,PUERTO RICAN MAN,"Buenos dias, my friend."
S09E20,JERRY,Not you! The guy in the Amigo.
S09E20,ELAINE,"Uh, well, uh, here--here is good."
S09E20,TAXI DRIVER,"Oh, yeah, sure, and now I'm gonna be stuck here. But you knew the way to go! You went to college!"
S09E20,ELAINE,"Hey, I went to Tufts! That was my safety school! So don't talk to me about hardship."
S09E20,ELAINE,"Boy, eh, can you believe this mess?"
S09E20,JERRY,"Elaine, why did you have the cab come down the street?! We were almost out!"
S09E20,LAMAR,So that was your girlfriend that blocked you in. That's real good.
S09E20,ELAINE,"I'm not his girlfriend. Well, actually, we used to date, but not anymore."
S09E20,JERRY,"Elaine, he doesn't need-"
S09E20,LAMAR,Used to date? So I guess you found out he's a jackass.
S09E20,JERRY,'Cause that's what's gonna happen.
S09E20,KRAMER,Wow. He's givin' you a mustache. Where is this guy?
S09E20,GEORGE,Don't look around. Don't look around. That's what he wants.
S09E20,ELAINE,"All right. Well, I'll see ya. Hey, George, I think there's a sniper lookin' to pop ya."
S09E20,GEORGE,"This thing can't hurt me, can it? I mean, it is a laser. What if it hits my eye?"
S09E20,JERRY,I don't know.
S09E20,GEORGE,"I can't be blind, Jerry The blind are courageous."
S09E20,KRAMER,"You'll be fine as long as it doesn't hit you right in the pupil, 'Cause then the whole ball will go up like the Death Star. Tchoo! I gotta go find a bathroom."
S09E20,JERRY,"Hold it, George. Don't move. It's right between your eyes."
S09E20,GEORGE,"Oh, my god."
S09E20,JERRY,"Hey, there's the soda guy."
S09E20,LAMAR,"Hey, jackass! Get me a diet Dr. Pepper!"
S09E20,JERRY (exasperated),All right!
S09E20,OLDER MAN,"Hey, hey, hey!"
S09E20,OLDER WOMAN,Wha--ow!
S09E20,ELAINE,"Oh, this is nuts! I can't get across anywhere!"
S09E20,OLDER MAN,"Well, none of us can! We're trapped!"
S09E20,OLDER WOMAN,Ow!
S09E20,ELAINE,"Hey! Hey, everyone. This way. I think we can get out through here."
S09E20,OLDER MAN,"Oh, I don't know if that's such a good idea."
S09E20,ELAINE,"Look! No one knows how long this parade is gonna last! They are a very festive people. All I know is that it's Sunday night, and I have got to unwind! Now who's with me?!"
S09E20,OLDER WOMAN,Father?
S09E20,PRIEST,None of us saw the nylon flap. That might mean something.
S09E20,PREGNANT WOMAN,"Oh, all right, all right!"
S09E20,ELAINE,All right! Come on. Come on. Let's go. Let's go.
S09E20,BUSINESS MAN,But it's dark!
S09E20,ELAINE,Get in there!
S09E20,KRAMER,"Yes, uh, I'm interested in the apartment."
S09E20,SALES WOMAN,"Yes! Come in, come in."
S09E20,KRAMER,Ok.
S09E20,SALES WOMAN,I'm Christine Nyhart.
S09E20,KRAMER,Oh. Delicious to meet you.
S09E20,SALES WOMAN,Did the broker send you over?
S09E20,KRAMER,"Uh, yes, most likely, yes. I'm, uh, H.E. Pennypacker. I'm a wealthy industrialist and philanthropist and, uh, a bicyclist. And, um, yes, I'm looking for a place where I can settle down with my, uh, peculiar habits, and, uh, the women that I frequent with. (sniffing wall) Mmm. Mombassa, hmm?"
S09E20,SALES WOMAN,The asking price is $1.5 million.
S09E20,KRAMER,"Oh, I spend that much on after shave. Yes, I buy and sell men like myself every day. Now, I assume that there's a waterfall grotto?"
S09E20,SALES WOMAN,No.
S09E20,KRAMER,How about a bathroom?
S09E20,SALES WOMAN,It has 4.
S09E20,KRAMER,"Yes, and where would the absolute nearest one be?"
S09E20,SALES WOMAN,Just down the hall.
S09E20,KRAMER,"Oh, thank you."
S09E20,ELAINE,"Oh, don't worry. We'll get you home to your husband real soon."
S09E20,PREGNANT WOMAN,I'm not married.
S09E20,ELAINE,"Well, I, for one, really respect that."
S09E20,PREGNANT WOMAN,"Oh, thank you."
S09E20,ELAINE (whispering),Hey! Guess who's not married.
S09E20,OLDER MAN,Is the boyfriend still in the picture?
S09E20,ELAINE,"Come on, father, you can make it."
S09E20,PRIEST,"No, I can't. I've got a bad hip. Go on without me."
S09E20,ELAINE,No! I won't!
S09E20,PRIEST,Leave me! you must.
S09E20,ELAINE,All right. Take it easy.
S09E20,ELAINE,"All right, we can move faster without father o'gimpy."
S09E20,PRIEST,I heard that!
S09E20,LAMAR,"You know, I don't think I've ever seen a man driving a Saab convertible. Still haven't."
S09E20,JERRY (sarcastically),Ho ho!
S09E20,JERRY,"What seems to be the problem, officer?"
S09E20,GEORGE,"They're for protection, Jerry. Can you tell where I'm lookin'?"
S09E20,JERRY,At me?
S09E20,GEORGE,No.
S09E20,JERRY,Oh. It's back.
S09E20,GEORGE,"Bring it on, baby"
S09E20,JERRY,What if it gets in the side?
S09E20,GEORGE,The side?
S09E20,JERRY,"Yeah. Wouldn't it just bounce back and forth between your cornea and the mirror, faster and faster, getting more and more intense, until finally-"
S09E20,GEORGE,All right!
S09E20,JERRY,Oh. It's in your eye now.
S09E20,KRAMER,"Hola, Jerry! I'm into this Puerto Rican day! The sights! The sounds! The hot, spicy flavor of it all! It's caliente, Jerry!"
S09E20,JERRY,"Kramer, the Mets have got men on base!"
S09E20,KRAMER,"Yeah, I know! I was watchin' the game."
S09E20,JERRY,You were watchin'? Where?
S09E20,JERRY,"Oh, that was a strike! Did you see that?!"
S09E20,SALES WOMAN,"Would you like to see the rest of the apartment, Mister, um--"
S09E20,JERRY,"Eh...Varnsen. Kel Varnsen. Actually, this room intrigues me. Why is it called the TV room?"
S09E20,SALES WOMAN,"Well, it's--"
S09E20,JERRY,Balk?! How was that a balk?! You have any snacks?
S09E20,SALES WOMAN,"Mr. Varnsen, if you like the apartment, I should tell you I've also had some interest from a wealthy industrialist."
S09E20,JERRY,Not Pennypacker!
S09E20,SALES WOMAN,You know him?
S09E20,JERRY,"I wish I didn't. Brace yourself, madam, for an all-out bidding war. But this time, advantage Varnsen!"
S09E20,GEORGE,"Wait a second. I think I see where that laser guy is. No! Don't look! Don't look. Oh, yeah, that's him. Ok. I'm gonna sneak up on him. Now the hunted becomes the hunter."
S09E20,ELAINE,We should be able to get across right through here!
S09E20,OLDER WOMAN,It's a dead end!
S09E20,ELAINE,"Oh, no! I thought--"
S09E20,BUSINESS MAN,You thought?! We're gonna die in the dark! I knew it! I knew it! We're gonna die!
S09E20,ELAINE,Get a hold of yourself!
S09E20,PREGNANT WOMAN,"Oh, come on!"
S09E20,ELAINE,Sorry. Somebody...help us!
S09E20,MAN,!Mira! !Mira! Stacy Keach!
S09E20,ELAINE,We're down here! Help!
S09E20,MAN,There's people down there! Hold on!
S09E20,ELAINE,Let us out. There's an unmarried pregnant woman down here.
S09E20,PREGNANT WOMAN,Don't judge me!
S09E20,ELAINE,Help us up so we can cross the street?
S09E20,POLICE OFFICER,"Nah, nah, You can't cross here. There's a parade."
S09E20,ELAINE,But we've come so far. We just want to unwind.
S09E20,POLICE OFFICER,"Hey, what can I tell ya?"
S09E20,BUSINESS MAN,Wanna make out some more?
S09E20,ELAINE,"Oh, god! Let us out!"
S09E20,GEORGE,That wasn't a laser pen.
S09E20,DELIVERY MAN,No. It's just a pen.
S09E20,GEORGE,"Oh, that's funny"
S09E20,DELIVERY MAN,"No. You have, like, a dot on your face. Whoever's doing that is very clever."
S09E20,KRAMER,"Come on, man. You need to lighten up. You know, a feeling like this only happens once a year."
S09E20,KRAMER,"Yeah, it's like this every day in Puerto Rico."
S09E20,KRAMER,"See, now you're getting the spirit of it, huh?"
S09E20,KRAMER,Ooh! !Dios mio!
S09E20,MAN,Hey! There's a guy burning the Puerto Rican flag!
S09E20,BOB,Who! Who is burning the flag?!
S09E20,KRAMER,"Oh, no."
S09E20,BOB,Him?!
S09E20,CEDRIC,That's not very nice.
S09E20,KRAMER,It was an accident.
S09E20,BOB,"Do you know what day this is? Because I know what day this is, they know what day this is, so I was wondering if you know what day this is!"
S09E20,CEDRIC,Because it's Puerto Rican day.
S09E20,BOB,Maybe we should stomp you like you stomp the flag! What do you think of that?
S09E20,KRAMER,"Now look, I just have one thing to say to you boys. Mama!"
S09E20,SALES WOMAN,"Right this way, Mr. Vandelay."
S09E20,GEORGE,"Well, this is a lovely apartment. Lovely! My kids are gonna go crazy. I, uh, I wonder if I could see the bathrooms. Preferably one with some paint thinner and, uh, some rags?"
S09E20,SALES WOMAN,It's down the hall.
S09E20,JERRY,"Oh, hello..."
S09E20,GEORGE,Art.
S09E20,JERRY,"Mr. Vandelay, of course."
S09E20,SALES WOMAN,You two know each other?
S09E20,SALES WOMAN,Mr. Pennypacker!
S09E20,KRAMER,"Uh, yes, uh, I--I wanted to, uh, stop by and make sure that my shark tank fits-- uh, hello."
S09E20,SALES WOMAN,"Mr. Pennypacker, this is Mr. Vandelay, And you know Mr. Varnsen"
S09E20,KRAMER,"Uh, Varnsen."
S09E20,JERRY,Pennypacker.
S09E20,KRAMER,Vandelay.
S09E20,GEORGE,Pennypacker. Varnsen.
S09E20,JERRY,"Vandelay. Wait a second. Mr. Pennypacker, if you're here, and Mr. Vandelay is also here, then who's watching the factory?"
S09E20,KRAMER,The factory?
S09E20,JERRY,The Saab factory?
S09E20,KRAMER,"Jerry, that's in Sweden."
S09E20,JERRY,My car!
S09E20,KRAMER,"Well, you know, it's like this every day in Puerto Rico."
S09E20,GEORGE,"Jerry, the Mets lost."
S09E20,JERRY,I love a parade!
S09E20,GEORGE,How do you suppose they did that?
S09E20,KRAMER,"Well...there's no logical explanation. All right. Well, shall we go home?"
S09E20,JERRY,"Well, what about my car?"
S09E20,KRAMER,"Well, Jerry, you can't deduct it now."
S09E20,JERRY,"Hey, there's Elaine."
S09E20,ELAINE,Hey.
S09E20,JERRY,"Well, you look, uh...relaxed."
S09E20,ELAINE,"Well, it is Sunday night, and you know how I like to unwind."
S09E20,LAMAR,"Hey, black Saab. Looks like that building cut you off! Ha ha ha! See ya around!"
S09E20,JERRY,"Well, at least he didn't-"
S09E20,LAMAR,Jackass!
S09E20,JERRY,Somebody remember where we parked.
S09E20,KRAMER,This was a fun day. It's nice to get out.
S09E23,GEORGE,"I can't eat this without catsup. Would it kill her to check up on us? Would that be a terrible thing? ""How's everything? Do you need anything? What can I do for you?"""
S09E23,JERRY,I know what you mean.
S09E23,GEORGE,Do ya?
S09E23,JERRY,It's like going out with someone and you never hear from them again.
S09E23,GEORGE,Same thing!
S09E23,JERRY,"Not really, but it's something. Ask the people behind you."
S09E23,GEORGE,Excuse me. Are you using your catsup?
S09E23,WOMAN,What do you think? You want to give him the catsup?
S09E23,MAN,It's up to you.
S09E23,WOMAN,You know what? I don't think so. I'm going to need it from time to time.
S09E23,JERRY,So what are you doing later? You want to go to the movies?
S09E23,GEORGE,Nah - what for?
S09E23,JERRY,To see a movie.
S09E23,GEORGE,I've been to the movies.
S09E23,JERRY,Not this movie.
S09E23,GEORGE,"They're all the same. You go, you sit, you eat popcorn, you watch. I'm sick of it."
S09E23,JERRY,Did you shower today?
S09E23,GEORGE,Yeah.
S09E23,JERRY,That's usually the kind of mood I'm in when I haven't showered.
S09E23,GEORGE,"When is it going to be my turn, Jerry? When do I get my 15 minutes? I want my 15 minutes!"
S09E23,JERRY,"Oh, quit complaining. At least you have your health."
S09E23,GEORGE,Ah! Health's not good enough. I want more than health. Health's not doing it for me anymore. I'm sick of health.
S09E23,WOMAN,"All right, we're done. You can have it now."
S09E23,GEORGE,"Oh, very gracious."
S09E23,MAN,Nice day
S09E23,GEORGE,Yeah.
S09E23,JERRY,What is that?
S09E23,KRAMER,Hey! JoJo!
S09E23,JERRY,"Ey, ey!"
S09E23,ELAINE,"All right, thanks for the ride, Kramer."
S09E23,KRAMER,"No, thank you. So what are you doing?"
S09E23,JERRY,Nothing.
S09E23,KRAMER,"Come on, let's go to the beach."
S09E23,GEORGE,What are you crazy?
S09E23,KRAMER,What? It's a beautiful day.
S09E23,JERRY,Have a good time.
S09E23,KRAMER,"Yeah, there's something in the air today. You feel it? There's something in the air."
S09E23,JERRY,You know you're turning into Burt Lancaster?
S09E23,KRAMER,"Yeah, there's something in the air."
S09E23,ELAINE,"Oh, I forgot to call Jill. Jill. Hi, it's Elaine. How is your father? Is everything okay? What? I can't hear you so good. There's a lot of static. Wha? I'm going to call you back."
S09E23,JERRY,Jill's father is in the hospital and you call to ask about him on a cell phone?
S09E23,ELAINE,What? No good?
S09E23,JERRY,Faux pas.
S09E23,ELAINE,Faux pas?
S09E23,GEORGE,Big hefty stinking faux pas.
S09E23,ELAINE,Why?
S09E23,JERRY,"You can't make a health inquiry on a cell phone. It's like saying ""I don't want to take up any of my important time in my home so I'll just get it out of the way on the street."""
S09E23,GEORGE,On-the-street cell-phone call is the lowest phone call you can make.
S09E23,JERRY,It's an act of total disregard. It's selfish.
S09E23,GEORGE,It's dismissive.
S09E23,JERRY,It's pompous.
S09E23,GEORGE,Why don't you think before you do something?
S09E23,ELAINE,Here's a thought - Bye bye.
S09E23,GEORGE,Too much?
S09E23,GEORGE,Boy - I'm really surprised at Elaine - that whole phone business - she should know better than that.
S09E23,JERRY,Hey - hey - hey!
S09E23,GEORGE,What?
S09E23,JERRY,"Where do you think this relationship is? If you are thinking of instituting an open-door urination policy, let me disabuse you of that notion right now, my friend."
S09E23,GEORGE,You're so uptight.
S09E23,JERRY,"Uptight? Let's all just have a big pee party. Hey everybody, grab a bucket. We're going up to Jerry's. It's a pee party."
S09E23,PHONE TAPE,"Jerry, this is Elizabeth Clark calling from James Kimbrough's office at NBC. Could you please give us a call?Thanks."
S09E23,JERRY,"Hello. Yeah, hi, this is Jerry Seinfeld calling for James Kimbrough. Hello? Hi? Uh huh, really, uh, no problem, definitely, ok, buhbye. That was James Kimbrough."
S09E23,GEORGE,Who's he?
S09E23,JERRY,"He is the new president of NBC. He wants to sit down with us and talk about ""Jerry."""
S09E23,GEORGE,"Our show, ""Jerry""?"
S09E23,JERRY,Right.
S09E23,GEORGE,"""Jerry"", oh my God. He wants to talk about ""Jerry""?"
S09E23,JERRY,Yeah!
S09E23,GEORGE,When?
S09E23,JERRY,"Today, like right now."
S09E23,GEORGE,"Right now? ""Jerry""?"
S09E23,JERRY,"""Jerry""!"
S09E23,GEORGE,"He wants to talk about ""Jerry""?"
S09E23,JERRY,"He wants to talk about ""Jerry""!"
S09E23,GEORGE,"""Jerry""!"
S09E23,JERRY,"""Jerry""!"
S09E23,GEORGE,Can I go like this?
S09E23,JERRY,Sure!
S09E23,GEORGE,No sports jacket? I don't need a sports jacket? Writers wear sports jackets.
S09E23,JERRY,Forget the sports jacket.
S09E23,GEORGE,I won't feel like a writer.
S09E23,JERRY,You're not a writer.
S09E23,GEORGE,Right!
S09E23,GEORGE,Water. Need some water! Water here!
S09E23,JERRY,"Ok, now listen, I don't want any scenes in here like the last time."
S09E23,GEORGE,"Don't worry, don't worry, no scenes."
S09E23,JERRY,Don't blow this.
S09E23,GEORGE,I will not blow this.
S09E23,JERRY,"If he says he doesn't want it to be a show about nothing, don't go nuts."
S09E23,GEORGE,"It's fine, it doesn't have to be about nothing."
S09E23,JERRY,He might not want nothing.
S09E23,GEORGE,"Something, nothing, I could care less."
S09E23,JERRY,He might want a show about anything and everything.
S09E23,GEORGE,"Anything, everything, something, nothing - Who the hell cares? Put me down. I'm down!"
S09E23,JERRY,All right.
S09E23,RECEPTIONIST,Mr. Kimbrough is ready to see you
S09E23,GEORGE,Magic time.
S09E23,JERRY,What?
S09E23,GEORGE,nothing
S09E23,RECEPTIONIST,Mr. Kimbrough.
S09E23,STU,"Hey, Jerry, good to see you."
S09E23,GEORGE,"Hey, hey, hey!"
S09E23,STU,How you been?
S09E23,JERRY,"Good, good. You remember George."
S09E23,STU,"George, good to see you."
S09E23,GEORGE,Hello Stu.
S09E23,STU,You remember Jay Crespi.
S09E23,GEORGE,"Jay Crespi, how am I gonna forget Jay Crespi?"
S09E23,STU,This is James Kimbrough.
S09E23,KIMBROUGH,"Nice to meet you, pleasure, thanks for coming in."
S09E23,GEORGE,Kimbrough.
S09E23,JERRY,Don't spell.
S09E23,GEORGE,K-I-M-B-R-O-U-G-H
S09E23,KIMBROUGH,That's right.
S09E23,GEORGE,It's a talent I have.
S09E23,KIMBROUGH,"Why don't we sit down, glad you're here."
S09E23,GEORGE,Woo! Some day out there - You ever see weather like that? Woo! It's crisp - it's crispy crisp.
S09E23,JERRY,"Shut up, George."
S09E23,KIMBROUGH,Can I get you anything?
S09E23,GEORGE,What do we have in the fruit department?
S09E23,JERRY,Oy.
S09E23,STU,Pineapple.
S09E23,GEORGE,"Oh, that's a dangerous fruit. It's like a weapon that thing, got spikes on the end. You can get killed from one of those things."
S09E23,KIMBROUGH,"Anyway, let me tell you why I called. When I took over here last month, I reviewed what was in development,and it was pretty much same old, same old."
S09E23,GEORGE,"Been there, done that."
S09E23,KIMBROUGH,Right. I was looking for something different. Something that would have people talking at the water coolers.
S09E23,GEORGE,Water coolers?
S09E23,CRESPI,We call it a water-cooler show.
S09E23,JERRY,"Because the next day in the offices, people gather around the water coolers to talk about it, right?"
S09E23,GEORGE,"See, I think people would talk about it at the coffee machines."
S09E23,JERRY,"Well it's probably just easier to say ""water cooler show"" than ""coffee machine show."""
S09E23,GEORGE,It's really not accurate. Nobody drinks from a water cooler any more - they use bottles.
S09E23,JERRY,But I think Mr. Kimbrough makes a good point.
S09E23,KIMBROUGH,"Anyway, Stu here started telling me about a show, ""Jerry"", that he developed five years ago."
S09E23,STU,I have always loved it.
S09E23,KIMBROUGH,"He said it was a show about nothing. So, I saw the pilot and I've got to tell you - I flipped out."
S09E23,CRESPI,He totally flipped out.
S09E23,KIMBROUGH,"What I want to do is put it on the air. 13-episode commitment. Start it off on Wednesday night, build up an audience. This show needs time to grow. I love that Kramer guy."
S09E23,JERRY,He's a little off the wall.
S09E23,CRESPI,Oh yeah.
S09E23,STU,Kramer.
S09E23,KIMBROUGH,And Elaine - I wouldn't mind seeing something happening between you two.
S09E23,JERRY,Definitely.
S09E23,GEORGE,"I tell you, I really don't think so-called relationship humor is what this show is all about."
S09E23,KIMBROUGH,"Or we could not do the show altogether, how about that?"
S09E23,GEORGE,Or we could get them together. Woo!
S09E23,GEORGE,Yeah!
S09E23,JERRY,Yeah!
S09E23,ELAINE,"Jill, hi, it's Elaine. Well, I'm calling from my home. Indoors. Well, I was just calling to see how your fa.. I'm sorry, I'm getting another call. Hang on just a second. Hello?"
S09E23,JERRY,"Hi. Elaine, it's me."
S09E23,ELAINE,"Jerry, I'm on the other line."
S09E23,JERRY,No no - this is an emergency - get off the phone.
S09E23,ELAINE,"I'm sorry, Jill. I'm going to have to take this call. Jerry, what's the emergency?"
S09E23,JERRY,"The ""Jerry""'s back on - the TV show! George and I are moving to California!"
S09E23,ELAINE,That's the emergency?
S09E23,JERRY,Did you hear what I said?
S09E23,ELAINE,I was on the other line talking to Jill.
S09E23,JERRY,"Jill? Well, why didn't you say so?"
S09E23,ELAINE,You said it was an emergency.
S09E23,JERRY,So now she's lost a phone face-off? That's even worse than your cell phone walk-and-talk.
S09E23,HELEN,"Congratulations, they're doing the show."
S09E23,MORTY,"They should have put that show on 5 years ago. Bunch of idiots at that network. Can I tell you something, Jerry? It's all crap on TV. The only thing I watch is Xena the Warrior Princess. She must be about six-six."
S09E23,HELEN,She's not six-six.
S09E23,MORTY,"Jerry, you ever watch that?"
S09E23,JERRY,"Yeah, it's pretty good."
S09E23,ESTELLE,They picked up the show?
S09E23,GEORGE,I'm moving to California.
S09E23,FRANK,"Oh baby-doll, this kid's going places, I told you."
S09E23,ESTELLE,The NBC guy liked it?
S09E23,GEORGE,Of course he liked it.
S09E23,ESTELLE,He told you he liked it?
S09E23,GEORGE,He wouldn't put it on if he didn't like it.
S09E23,ESTELLE,"Well, what are you doing?"
S09E23,GEORGE,I'm writing.
S09E23,ESTELLE,You know how to write?
S09E23,FRANK,"Without the writing, you have nothing. You're the ones that make them look good."
S09E23,ESTELLE,Since when do you know how to write? I never saw you write anything.
S09E23,GEORGE,Ma?!
S09E23,ESTELLE,I don't know how you're going to write all those shows. And where are you get all the ideas?
S09E23,FRANK,Would you leave him alone? You'll shatter his confidence!
S09E23,GEORGE,I don't need any ideas. It's a show about nothing.
S09E23,ESTELLE,Nothing. Please. I'll tell you the truth - the whole thing sounds pretty stupid to me.
S09E23,JERRY,"NBC is letting me use their private jet? And I can go anywhere I want? That's fantastic! Thanks. Great. Okay, bye."
S09E23,KRAMER,Oh hey!
S09E23,JERRY,Hey - how was the beach?
S09E23,KRAMER,"Oh, you missed it, buddy - lot of femininas - some major femininas"
S09E23,JERRY,I had a little meeting today at NBC. What are you doing?
S09E23,KRAMER,"You know, I went swimming and I can't get this water out of my ear."
S09E23,JERRY,"So do you remember five years ago, we did that pilot, ""Jerry""? Well, the new guy at NBC wants to do it. They're putting it on the air! They're giving us a 13-episode commitment. George and I are moving to California!"
S09E23,KRAMER,You're moving to California?
S09E23,JERRY,"Yeah, only for a while."
S09E23,KRAMER,"Yeah, but Jerry, what happens if the show's a hit? You could be out there for years! You might never come back."
S09E23,JERRY,"No, I'll be back."
S09E23,KRAMER,"Jerry. It's L.A. Nobody leaves. She's a seductress, she's a siren, she's a virgin, she's a whore."
S09E23,JERRY,"And my agent said as a bonus, I can use their private jet, so we'll all go somewhere - the four of us, one big fling before George and I go to California."
S09E23,KRAMER,Fling!
S09E23,ELAINE,So we can go anywhere we want?
S09E23,JERRY,Anywhere.
S09E23,ELAINE,Why are they doing this?
S09E23,JERRY,I think they want to make it up to us cause they let this thing sit on their shelf for five years.
S09E23,ELAINE,This is all very exciting.
S09E23,GEORGE,So? Where are we going?
S09E23,KRAMER,I say Japan.
S09E23,ELAINE,Why Japan?
S09E23,KRAMER,"Oh - geishas - they cater to your every whim. They're shy at first, but they're quite skilled at conversation. They can discuss anything from world affairs to the fine art of fishing - or baking."
S09E23,ELAINE,Oh - I got it - how about Russia?
S09E23,JERRY,"Russia, it's so bleak."
S09E23,ELAINE,It's not bleak - it's springtime.
S09E23,JERRY,It's still bleak.
S09E23,ELAINE,You can't be bleak in spring.
S09E23,JERRY,You can be bleak in spring.
S09E23,GEORGE,"If you're bleak, you're bleak."
S09E23,ELAINE,What about Switzerland?
S09E23,KRAMER,"Oh - Switzerland - the Von Trapp family, huh?"
S09E23,GEORGE,It's a bit hilly - no?
S09E23,ELAINE,You're not going to do any walking.
S09E23,GEORGE,What if I want to walk around a little?
S09E23,ELAINE,So then you'll walk down the hill and we'll pick you up.
S09E23,GEORGE,What if I'm at the bottom?
S09E23,ELAINE,"All right! You know what, just forget it!"
S09E23,JERRY,"Alright - come on - come on now, people. Let's face it, we're not all going to agree on anything. Why don't we all just go to Paris?"
S09E23,ELAINE,I'll go to Paris.
S09E23,GEORGE,Me too.
S09E23,KRAMER,Oh yeah - oui oui.
S09E23,JERRY,"So that's it - it's settled, we're going to Paris."
S09E23,GROUP,Yeah!
S09E23,ELAINE,Hey. NBC limo is downstairs - beep beep beep. {NBC tune} I'm just going to call Jill one more time before we go.
S09E23,JERRY,"Wait, you can't make a call like that on your way out. You can't rush that conversation."
S09E23,ELAINE,"Well, I can't call from the limo. Can I call from the plane?"
S09E23,JERRY,"First you make a cell-phone walk-and-talk, then she loses a call-waiting face-off, now you're talking about a plane call?"
S09E23,ELAINE,"All right, I'll just have to call her from Paris."
S09E23,NEWMAN,"Hello, Jerry."
S09E23,JERRY,"Hello, Newman. What gives?"
S09E23,NEWMAN,I was speaking earlier with Kramer and he mentioned something about a private jet to Paris?
S09E23,JERRY,"Yeah, that's right."
S09E23,NEWMAN,"Well, I hear it's quite beautiful there this time of year, and of course you know I'm one-quarter French."
S09E23,JERRY,Really.
S09E23,NEWMAN,"Oh yes, in fact I still have family there. This probably won't interest you, but I have a cousin there who's suffering very badly. She's lost all use of her muscles. She can only communicate by blinking. I would so love to see her - bring a ray of sunshine into her tragic life. But alas, I can't afford it, for I am, as you know, but a simple postal worker."
S09E23,JERRY,That's a shame.
S09E23,NEWMAN,Take me! Take me!
S09E23,JERRY,"Oh, forget it. Pull yourself together. You're making me sick. Be a man!"
S09E23,NEWMAN,"All right! But hear me and hear me well - The day will come. Oh yes, mark my words, Seinfeld - your day of reckoning is coming. When an evil wind will blow through your little playworld, and wipe that smug smile off your face. And I'll be there, in all my glory, watching - watching as it all comes crumbling down."
S09E23,CAPTAIN,"Ah, Jerry?"
S09E23,JERRY,Yeah.
S09E23,CAPTAIN,"I'm Captain Maddox this is my co-pilot, Kurt Adams. Ready to go to Paris?"
S09E23,JERRY,All set. We'll just grab the bags.
S09E23,CAPTAIN,Don't worry about that. We'll take care of them for you.
S09E23,JERRY,Just keeps on getting better and better.
S09E23,JERRY,Not bad.
S09E23,ELAINE,Wow!
S09E23,KRAMER,The only way to fly.
S09E23,GEORGE,This is it?
S09E23,GEORGE,"I'm sorry - I have to say, I'm a little disappointed, I thought it would be a lot nicer."
S09E23,JERRY,You're complaining about a private jet?
S09E23,GEORGE,You think this is the plane that Ted Danson gets?
S09E23,JERRY,Ted Danson is not even on the network anymore.
S09E23,GEORGE,"Still, I bet when they gave him a plane, it was a lot nicer than this one."
S09E23,ELAINE,Will you shut up? You are ruining the whole trip.
S09E23,GEORGE,This is a real piece of junk. I don't even feel safe on this thing. I have a good mind to write a letter toMr. Kimbrough.
S09E23,JERRY,You're not writing any letters!
S09E23,ELAINE,Will you turn around?
S09E23,GEORGE,Why?
S09E23,ELAINE,You are annoying me sitting like that. It's effeminate.
S09E23,GEORGE,It's effeminate to sit like this?
S09E23,ELAINE,"Yes, I think it's a little effeminate."
S09E23,GEORGE,How is this effeminate?
S09E23,ELAINE,I don't know - it just is.
S09E23,GEORGE,"Kramer, what are you doing?"
S09E23,JERRY,Still got water in your ear?
S09E23,KRAMER,Can't get rid of it. Maybe it leaked inside my brain.
S09E23,GEORGE,Would you stop that? It's not safe to be jumping up and down on a plane.
S09E23,KRAMER,"I got to get it out, I can't take this anymore."
S09E23,GEORGE,"Kramer, don't be fooling around up here."
S09E23,GEORGE,Kramer!
S09E23,CAPTAIN,"Hey, get the hell out of here!"
S09E23,ELAINE,What is that?
S09E23,GEORGE,Oh my God!
S09E23,ELAINE,What is that noise? What is that noise?
S09E23,JERRY,"Kramer, what the hell did you do?"
S09E23,KRAMER,I lost my balance.
S09E23,ELAINE,Oh my God!
S09E23,ELAINE,What's going on?
S09E23,JERRY,Kramer!
S09E23,KRAMER,It was an accident.
S09E23,GEORGE,I told you to stop with the hopping.
S09E23,ELAINE,"Oh my God, we're going down. We're going to die!"
S09E23,GEORGE,Just when I was doing great. I told you God wouldn't let me be successful.
S09E23,JERRY,Is this it? Is this how it ends? It can't- it can't end like this.
S09E23,KRAMER,I'm ready! I'm ready! Glory hallelujah!
S09E23,GEORGE,Jerry? Jerry can you hear me?
S09E23,JERRY,Yeah.
S09E23,GEORGE,There's something I have to tell you.
S09E23,JERRY,What? What is it?
S09E23,GEORGE,I cheated in the contest.
S09E23,ELAINE,What?
S09E23,JERRY,What?
S09E23,GEORGE,The contest - I cheated.
S09E23,JERRY,Why?
S09E23,GEORGE,Because I'm a cheater! I had to tell you.
S09E23,JERRY,Great - I won.
S09E23,ELAINE,"Jerry, I gotta tell you something too."
S09E23,JERRY,"Yeah, Elaine I got something I want to say to you."
S09E23,ELAINE,No no - me first.
S09E23,JERRY,Alright.
S09E23,ELAINE,"Jerry, I've always loved ..u.."
S09E23,GEORGE,Hey - What's going on?
S09E23,KRAMER,We're straightening out!
S09E23,ELAINE,We're straightening out?
S09E23,JERRY,We're straightening out!
S09E23,GEORGE,We're straightening out!
S09E23,GROUP,Yeah!
S09E23,CAPTAIN,"Well, again, sorry about that little mishap. But once you get everything checked out there shouldn't be anymore problems."
S09E23,JERRY,Where are we?
S09E23,CAPTAIN,"Latham, Massachusetts. Why don't you take a cab into town, get yourself something to eat. I got your beeper number - I'll beep you as soon as we're ready."
S09E23,JERRY,Okay.
S09E23,ELAINE,Okay.
S09E23,JERRY,We'll see you later.
S09E23,ELAINE,"Well, what are we going to do about Paris? I mean are we actually going to get back on this plane?"
S09E23,JERRY,"I say we go back to New York, and take a regular flight."
S09E23,GEORGE,I'm not getting on a regular plane now - I'm all psyched up to go on a private jet. No way I'm getting on a regular plane.
S09E23,ELAINE,"Well, I'm sure that they would fly us first class."
S09E23,GEORGE,"First class doesn't make it anymore. Now you get on the phone with Kimbrough, tell him what happened and tell him to get another plane down here, but this time, the good one - the Ted Danson plane."
S09E23,JERRY,"Alright, I'll feel him out."
S09E23,GEORGE,"Yeah, just tell him to hurry it up."
S09E23,STRANGER,Nice day.
S09E23,JERRY,Another one?
S09E23,ROBBER,"Alright fatso, out of the car."
S09E23,KRAMER,I want to capture this.
S09E23,ROBBER,Come on! Gimme your wallet.
S09E23,VOGEL,Don't shoot.
S09E23,JERRY,"Well, there goes the money for the lipo."
S09E23,ELAINE,"See, the great thing about robbing a fat guy is it's an easy getaway. You know? They can't really chase ya!"
S09E23,GEORGE,He's actually doing him a favor. It's less money for him to buy food.
S09E23,ROBBER,"I want your wallet. Come on. Come on, come on."
S09E23,JERRY,"That's a shame. Alright, I'm gonna call NBC."
S09E23,VOGEL,"Officer, he's stealing my car! Officer, I was carjacked. I was held up at gunpoint! He took my wallet, everything!"
S09E23,JERRY,"Okay, thanks anyway. They can't get another plane."
S09E23,KRAMER,"All right, what's wrong with the plane we got? They're just checking it out."
S09E23,ELAINE,Forget it.
S09E23,JERRY,"No, no, no. We're not getting on there. Come on, let's go get something to eat in Sticksville."
S09E23,OFFICER,"All right, hold it right there."
S09E23,KRAMER,What?
S09E23,OFFICER,You're under arrest.
S09E23,JERRY,Under arrest? What for?
S09E23,OFFICER,Article 223-7 of the Latham County Penal Code.
S09E23,ELAINE,"What? No, no - we didn't do anything."
S09E23,OFFICER,That's exactly right. The law requires you to help or assist anyone in danger as long as it's reasonable todo so.
S09E23,GEORGE,I never heard of that.
S09E23,OFFICER,It's new. It's called the Good Samaritan Law. Let's go.
S09E23,ELAINE,The Good Samaritan Law? Are they crazy?
S09E23,GEORGE,Why would we want to help somebody?
S09E23,ELAINE,I know.
S09E23,GEORGE,That's what nuns and Red Cross workers are for.
S09E23,KRAMER,The Samaritans were an ancient tribe - very helpful to people.
S09E23,ELAINE,"Alright - um, excuse me, hi, could you tell me what kind of law this is."
S09E23,DEPUTY,"Well, they just passed it last year. It's modeled after the French law. I heard about it after Princess Diana was killed and all those photographers were just standing around."
S09E23,JERRY,"Oh, yeah."
S09E23,ELAINE,"Oh, yeah."
S09E23,DEPUTY,"You're the first ones to be arrested on it, probably in the whole country."
S09E23,GEORGE,"All right, so what's the penalty here? Let's just pay the fine or something and get the hell out of here."
S09E23,DEPUTY,"Well, it's not that easy. Now see, the law calls for a maximum fine of $85,000 and as much as five years in prison."
S09E23,ELAINE,What?
S09E23,GEORGE,Oh no no no no - we have to be in California next week. We're starting a TV show.
S09E23,DEPUTY,"California? Oh gosh, I don't think so. Yeah, my guess is you're gonna be prosecuted. Better get yourselves a good lawyer."
S09E23,CHILES,Who told you to put the cheese on? Did I tell you to put the cheese on? I didn't tell you to put the cheese on.
S09E23,SECRETARY,Jerry Seinfeld on the phone.
S09E23,CHILES,"You people with the cheese. It never ends. Hello? Uh huh. Uh huh. Uh huh. Good Samaritan Law? I never heard of it. You don't have to help anybody. That's what this country's all about. That's deplorable, unfathomable, improbable. Hold on. Suzie, cancel my appointment with Dr. Bison. And pack a bag for me. I want to get to Latham, Massachusetts,right away."
S09E23,HOYT,"So they got Jackie Chiles, huh? (Sets down the newspaper) Uh hmm. You know what that means. This whole place is going to be swarming with media by the time this thing is over. You're not going to be able to find a hotel room in this town. The whole country is going to be watching us. Now we got to do whatever it takes to win it, no matter what the cost. The big issue in this trial is going to be character. I want you to find out everything you can about these people - and I mean everything."
S09E23,KRAMER,"Mmmm, this is pretty good chow, huh?"
S09E23,GEORGE,"Would it kill him to check up on us? No - drops off the meals and that's it. I realize we're prisoners, but we're still entitled to catsup."
S09E23,ELAINE,I guess we could've called for help.
S09E23,JERRY,But then we would have missed the whole thing.
S09E23,KRAMER,I still had it on video. We could have watched it later.
S09E23,GEORGE,"Yeah, he's right."
S09E23,JERRY,I forgot about the video.
S09E23,ELAINE,Sure - the video.
S09E23,ELAINE,What is that?
S09E23,JERRY,Plane's ready.
S09E23,RIVERA,"Hi everybody, I'm Geraldo Rivera. Tonight we'll be talking about what most of you have probably been discussing in your homes, and around the water coolers in your offices. I am speaking of course of the controversial Good Samaritan trial that gets underway Thursday in Latham, Massachusetts. Now before we meet our distinguished panel, let's go to Latham live, where Jane Wells is standing by. Jane-"
S09E23,WELLS,"Yes. Good evening, Geraldo."
S09E23,RIVERA,What's the mood? What's going on tonight?
S09E23,WELLS,"Well, Latham is fairly quite tonight, considering the media circus that has descended upon this quaint little town."
S09E23,RIVERA,And what about the defendants - the so-called New York Four. How are they holding up?
S09E23,WELLS,"Well, I did speak with one of the deputies who had some contact with them, and he told me quote ""There's no love lost with that group."""
S09E23,RIVERA,"Anything else, Jane?"
S09E23,WELLS,"There also seems to be some friction between Mr. Seinfeld, and Ms. Benes. The rumor is that they once dated, and it's possible that ended badly."
S09E23,RIVERA,"Well, ladies and gentlemen, who know, maybe this trial will bring them closer together. Maybe they'll even end up getting married."
S09E23,HELEN,I hope you packed enough - this trial could last for weeks.
S09E23,MORTY,What's all that?
S09E23,HELEN,Cereal.
S09E23,MORTY,You're packing cereal?
S09E23,HELEN,I'm bringing it for Jerry.
S09E23,MORTY,You got enough here for a life sentence.
S09E23,HELEN,He likes it. He says he misses that more that anything.
S09E23,MORTY,So bring a snack-pack.
S09E23,ESTELLE,"Poor Georgie, was it our fault this happened to him? Did we do something wrong? Maybe it was our fault."
S09E23,FRANK,Maybe it was your fault. It wasn't my fault. I can tell you that.
S09E23,ESTELLE,"Oh, so it was my fault, but not yours."
S09E23,FRANK,You were the one who smothered him.
S09E23,ESTELLE,I did not smother him.
S09E23,FRANK,You smothered! He couldn't get any air! He couldn't breathe! He was suffocating!
S09E23,ESTELLE,"Sure, and you were always in Korea with your religious chachkis."
S09E23,FRANK,I had to make a living!
S09E23,KRAMER,"This is excellent huh? Don't worry I didn't use too much milk, cause I know we gotta make it last."
S09E23,JERRY,"You know I've had to reduce my milk level. My whole life I've always filled to at least three quarters - sometimes, to the top of the cereal. Now, to conserve, I can't even see the milk anymore. It's a big adjustment."
S09E23,KRAMER,I bet.
S09E23,JERRY,It's one of the hardest things I've ever had to do.
S09E23,CHILES,Good morning.
S09E23,ELAINE,"Good morning, Jackie."
S09E23,JERRY,Good morning.
S09E23,CHILES,Is everybody ready? Didn't I tell you I wanted you to wear the cardigan?
S09E23,GEORGE,It makes me look older.
S09E23,CHILES,"Look older? Do you think this is a game? Is that what you think this is? I'm trying to give you amoral compass. You have no moral compass. You're going to walk into that courtroom, and the jury's going to see a mean, nasty, evil George Costanza. I want them to see Perry Como. No one's going to convict Perry Como. Perry Como helps out a fat tub who's getting robbed."
S09E23,CHILES,Do you think it's funny?
S09E23,JERRY,No.
S09E23,CHILES,"You damn right it isn't. You better not be carrying on laughing in that courtroom, funny man. Cause if you start getting all smart-alecky, making wisecracks, acting a fool, you gonna find yourself in here for a long, long time. I don't like that tie. Suzie, get one of my ties from my briefcase."
S09E23,ELAINE,"How do I look, Jackie?"
S09E23,CHILES,"Oh, you looking good. You look strong. You one fine-looking sexy lady."
S09E23,ELAINE,"Thank you, Jackie."
S09E23,KRAMER,"How bout me, Jackie?"
S09E23,CHILES,"Kramer, you always look good. You got respect for yourself. You're genuine. Jury's going to pick up on that."
S09E23,CHILES,Here.
S09E23,JERRY,This one?
S09E23,CHILES,That's right.
S09E23,JERRY,Do I have to?
S09E23,ELAINE,"Jackie says put it on, Jerry."
S09E23,BAILIFF,"All rise. Fourth District County Court, Latham, Massachusetts is now in session. The Honorable Judge Arthur Vandelay presiding."
S09E23,GEORGE,Vandelay? The judge's name is Vandelay?
S09E23,CHILES,Vanda who?
S09E23,GEORGE,"Jerry, did you hear that?"
S09E23,JERRY,Yeah.
S09E23,GEORGE,I think that's a good sign.
S09E23,VANDELAY,Is the District Attorney ready to proceed?
S09E23,HOYT,"We are, Your Honor."
S09E23,VANDELAY,Mr. Hoyt.
S09E23,HOYT,"Ladies and gentlemen, last year, our City Council by a vote of twelve to two, passed a Good Samaritan Law. Now, essentially, we made it a crime to ignore a fellow human being in trouble. Now this group from New York not only ignored, but, as we will prove, they actually mocked the victim as he was being robbed at gunpoint. I can guarantee you one other thing, ladies and gentlemen, this is not the first time they have behaved in this manner. On the contrary, they have quite a record of mocking and maligning. This is a history of selfishness, self-absorption, immaturity, and greed. And you will see how everyone who has come into contact with these four individuals has been abused, wronged, deceived and betrayed. This time, they have gone too far. This time they are going to be held accountable. This time, they are the ones who will pay."
S09E23,VANDELAY,Mr. Chiles.
S09E23,CHILES,"I am shocked and chagrined, mortified and stupefied. This trial is outrageous! It is a waste of the taxpayers' time and money. It is a travesty of justice that these four people have been incarcerated while the real perpetrator is walking around laughing - lying and laughing, laughing and lying. You know what these four people were? They were innocentbystanders. Now, you just think about that term. Innocent. Bystanders. Because that's exactly what they were. We know theywere bystanders, nobody's disputing that. So how can a bystander be guilty? No such thing. Have you ever heard of a guilty bystander? No, because you cannot be a bystander and be guilty. Bystanders are by definition, innocent. That is the nature of bystanding. But no, they want to change nature here. They want to create a whole new animal - the guilty bystander. Don't you let them do it. Only you can stop them."
S09E23,VANDELAY,Is the prosecution ready to present its first witness?
S09E23,HOYT,"We are, Your Honor. Call Officer Matt Vogel to the stand."
S09E23,BAILIFF,Call Matt Vogel.
S09E23,HOYT,So they were just standing there?
S09E23,VOGEL,Yes.
S09E23,HOYT,Did one of them have a video camera?
S09E23,VOGEL,Yes.
S09E23,HOYT,"Your Honor, with the court's permission, we would like to play back that video and enter it into evidence as Exhibit A."
S09E23,VANDELAY,Proceed.
S09E23,VOGEL,Don't shoot.
S09E23,JERRY,"Well, there goes the money for the lipo."
S09E23,ELAINE,"See, the great thing about robbing a fat guy is it's an easy getaway. They can't really chase ya!"
S09E23,GEORGE,He's actually doing him a favor. It's less money for him to buy food.
S09E23,[New Witness,the victim of the robbery]
S09E23,HOYT,So they just stood there and did nothing?
S09E23,VOGEL,"Yeah, nothing. Nothing!"
S09E23,HOYT,No further questions.
S09E23,GEORGE,Hey! Great plane! Thanks a lot. Piece of junk. You know you almost got us killed!
S09E23,HOYT,Call Mabel Choate to the stand.
S09E23,BAILIFF,Call Mabel Choate.
S09E23,CHILES,"Your Honor. I most strenuously and vigorously object to this witness. She was not present at the time of the incident. Her testimony is irrelevant, irrational, and inconsequential."
S09E23,HOYT,"Your Honor, the prosecution has gone to great lengths and considerable cost to find these character witnesses.It is imperative that we establish this is not merely an isolated incident. It's part of a pattern of anti-social behavior that's been going on for years."
S09E23,VANDELAY,Objection overruled. I'll hear the witness.
S09E23,HOYT,"Now, Mrs. Choate, would you please tell the court what happen the evening of January 4th."
S09E23,CHOATE,"Well, I was in Snitzer's Bakery when I got accosted by that man."
S09E23,HOYT,Let the record show that she is pointing at Mr. Seinfeld.
S09E23,HOYT,What did he want?
S09E23,CHOATE,My marble rye.
S09E23,HOYT,Your marble rye?
S09E23,CHOATE,"I got the last one. He kept persisting, and I said no."
S09E23,HOYT,And then you left the bakery.
S09E23,CHOATE,That's right.
S09E23,HOYT,"But it didn't end there, did it, Mrs. Choate?"
S09E23,CHOATE,Oh no.
S09E23,JERRY,Gimme that rye.
S09E23,CHOATE,Stop it.
S09E23,JERRY,I want that rye lady.
S09E23,CHOATE,Help - someone help.
S09E23,JERRY,"Shut up, you old bag!"
S09E23,HOYT,No further questions.
S09E23,HOYT,I call Marla Penny to the stand.
S09E23,BAILIFF,Call Marla Penny.
S09E23,JERRY,The virgin!
S09E23,HOYT,And what was your connection to the defendants?
S09E23,PENNY,I dated Mr. Seinfeld for several weeks in the autumn of 1992.
S09E23,HOYT,"Then on the evening of October 28, there was an abrupt end to that relationship. Tell us what happened."
S09E23,PENNY,It's rather difficult to talk about.
S09E23,HOYT,It's alright. Take your time.
S09E23,PENNY,"Well, I became aware of a -"
S09E23,HOYT,A what?
S09E23,PENNY,"A, uh -"
S09E23,HOYT,Yes?
S09E23,PENNY,A contest.
S09E23,HOYT,Contest?
S09E23,PENNY,Yes.
S09E23,HOYT,What was the nature of the contest?
S09E23,PENNY,"Oh please, I can't."
S09E23,HOYT,It's okay.
S09E23,PENNY,The four of them made a wager to see if they could -
S09E23,HOYT,Yes?
S09E23,PENNY,To see who could go the longest without gratifying themselves.
S09E23,PETERMAN,For the love of God!
S09E23,PENNY,"It was horrible, horrible!"
S09E23,HOYT,Call Donald Sanger to the stand.
S09E23,JERRY,Who the hell is that?
S09E23,MR. SANGER,"Come on Donald, you're doing fine."
S09E23,GEORGE,The Bubble Boy!
S09E23,CHILES,Bubble Boy?
S09E23,JERRY,"That's right, the Bubble Boy."
S09E23,CHILES,What's a Bubble Boy?
S09E23,JERRY,He's a boy who lives in a bubble.
S09E23,BUBBLE BOY,What the hell are all you looking at?
S09E23,HOYT,"So Donald, would you please tell the court about the incident that occurred in your house, October 7th, 1992."
S09E23,BUBBLE BOY,"Well, Jerry Seinfeld was supposed to come to my house, but his friend Costanza showed up instead, so I challenged him to a game of Trivial Pursuit."
S09E23,GEORGE,Who invaded Spain in the Eighth Century?
S09E23,BUBBLE BOY,That's a joke - the Moors.
S09E23,GEORGE,"Oh no - I'm so sorry, it's the Moops. The correct answer is the Moops."
S09E23,BUBBLE BOY,"Moops? Let me see that. That's not Moops, you jerk. It's Moors. It's a misprint."
S09E23,GEORGE,"Sorry, the card says Moops."
S09E23,BUBBLE BOY,It doesn't matter. It's Moors - there's no Moops.
S09E23,GEORGE,It's Moops.
S09E23,BUBBLE BOY,Moors!
S09E23,GEORGE,Moops!
S09E23,GEORGE,Help! Someone!
S09E23,BUBBLE BOY,"There's no Moops, you idiot."
S09E23,SUSAN,Stop it! Let go of him!
S09E23,MRS. SANGER,"Donald, stop it. No. Donald, stop it."
S09E23,GEORGE,It was Moops.
S09E23,BUBBLE BOY,Moors.
S09E23,[New Witness,"the lady Kramer gave a defective wheelchair to in ""The Handicapped Spot""]"
S09E23,HOYT,"So Mr. Costanza parked in a handicapped spot, and as a result you got in an accident, and your wheelchair was destroyed?"
S09E23,LADY,That's right.
S09E23,HOYT,And then Mr. Kramer gave you a used wheelchair?
S09E23,LADY,That's right.
S09E23,[New Witness,"Dr. Wilcox, the doctor on duty when Susan died]"
S09E23,HOYT,So you were the doctor on duty the night Susan Ross died?
S09E23,WILCOX,"Yes, that's right. It was May 16, 1996. I'll never forget it."
S09E23,HOYT,"So you broke the news to Mr. Costanza? Could you tell the court, please, what his reaction was?"
S09E23,WILCOX,I would describe it as restrained jubilation.
S09E23,MR. ROSS,Murderer!
S09E23,MRS. ROSS,He killed our daughter! He knew those envelopes were toxic!
S09E23,VANDELAY,Order in this court!
S09E23,HOYT,Call Sidra Holland to the stand.
S09E23,CHILES,"Whew! Look at this one, she fine. You dated her?"
S09E23,HOYT,So you met Jerry Seinfeld in a health club sometime in 1993?
S09E23,SIDRA,Yes.
S09E23,HOYT,And you also met Miss Benes in that same health club?
S09E23,SIDRA,"Yes, that's true."
S09E23,HOYT,Would you describe the circumstances of that meeting.
S09E23,SIDRA,"We were in the sauna, making chit-chat."
S09E23,SIDRA,"You know, I've seen you around the club. My name's Sidra. This is Marcie."
S09E23,ELAINE,"Oh, hi, I'm Elaine."
S09E23,HOYT,"So, she pretended to trip, and she fell into your breasts?"
S09E23,SIDRA,Yes.
S09E23,HOYT,Why would she do something like that?
S09E23,SIDRA,Because he sent her in there to find out if they were real.
S09E23,[New Witness,"Joe Bookman, library cop]"
S09E23,HOYT,State your name.
S09E23,BOOKMAN,"Bookman, Joe Bookman."
S09E23,HOYT,And what's your occupation?
S09E23,BOOKMAN,I'm a library cop.
S09E23,HOYT,What does a library cop do?
S09E23,BOOKMAN,We chase down library delinquents.
S09E23,HOYT,Anyone in this room ever delinquent?
S09E23,BOOKMAN,"Yeah, he was. Right over there - Seinfeld."
S09E23,HOYT,How long was his book overdue?
S09E23,BOOKMAN,25 years. We don't call them delinquent after that long.
S09E23,HOYT,What do you call them?
S09E23,BOOKMAN,Criminals.
S09E23,[New Witness,George's old girlfriend]
S09E23,HOYT,So you and Mr. Costanza were dating.
S09E23,WOMAN,Yes.
S09E23,HOYT,And then what happened?
S09E23,WOMAN,"Well, I invited him to attend my son's birthday party and -"
S09E23,GEORGE,Fire! Get out of the way!
S09E23,[New Witness,parking lot security guard]
S09E23,GUARD,"At the time, I was employed as a security guard in the parking lot at the Garden Valley Shopping Mall."
S09E23,JERRY,Why would I do it unless I was in mortal danger? I know it's against the law.
S09E23,GUARD,I don't know.
S09E23,JERRY,Because I could get uromycitisis poisoning and die - that's why.
S09E23,HOYT,Uromycitisis! I wonder if they're having any trouble controlling themselves during this trial? Perhaps these two hooligans would like to have a pee party right here in the courtroom!
S09E23,CHILES,"Objection, Your Honor! This is completely inappropriate! My clients' medical condition is not on trial here! I refer you to the Disability Act of 1990."
S09E23,VANDELAY,"Sit down, Mr. Chiles."
S09E23,[New Witness,Police Detective]
S09E23,HOYT,"Alright, Detective, then what happened?"
S09E23,DETECTIVE,We got a tip that a lot of prostitutes had been turning tricks in the parking lot.
S09E23,PROSTITUTE,You just cost me some money.
S09E23,KRAMER,"Cool it, lady. Cool it. Cool it, lady. Cool it."
S09E23,POLICE,Police officers - freeze right there!
S09E23,HOYT,"So Cosmo Kramer was, in fact, a pimp."
S09E23,[Witness,"the low-talker from ""The Puffy Shirt""]"
S09E23,HOYT,So you asked Mr. Seinfeld if he would wear your puffy shirt on the Today Show?
S09E23,LOW-TALKER,(Mumbles)
S09E23,HOYT,Excuse me?
S09E23,CHILES,"Uh, excuse me, Your Honor, but what is the point of this testimony? This woman's a low-talker. I can't hear a word she's saying. So either get some other kind of microphone up there, or let's move on."
S09E23,[New Witness,George Steinbrenner]
S09E23,HOYT,Call George Steinbrenner to the stand.
S09E23,BAILIFF,Call George Steinbrenner.
S09E23,HOYT,So George Costanza came to work for you in May of 1994?
S09E23,STEINBRENNER,"Yes, that's right, he was good kid - a lovely boy. Shared his calzone with me - that was a heck of a sandwich, wasn't it, Georgie?"
S09E23,GEORGE,"Yes, sir, that was a good sandwich, sir."
S09E23,STEINBRENNER,He had one little problem though.
S09E23,HOYT,What was that?
S09E23,STEINBRENNER,He was a communist. Thick as they come. Like a big juicy steak.
S09E23,FRANK,How could you give twelve million dollars to Hideki Irabu?!
S09E23,VANDELAY,Order!
S09E23,[New Witness,"Marcellino from ""The Little Jerry""]"
S09E23,HOYT,Cock fighting?
S09E23,MARCELLINO,Cock fighting.
S09E23,[New Witness,"Pharmacist from ""The Sponge""]"
S09E23,PHARMACIST,Sponges. I don't mean the kind you clean your tub with. They're for sex. Said she needed a whole case of them.
S09E23,[New Witness,Elaine's old boyfriend from work]
S09E23,MAN,She exposed her nipple.
S09E23,[New Witness,Mr. Pitt]
S09E23,HOYT,How did she try to kill you?
S09E23,PITT,She tried to smother me with a pillow.
S09E23,HOYT,Call Yev Kassem to the stand.
S09E23,BAILIFF,Call Yev Kassem.
S09E23,JERRY,Who?
S09E23,ELAINE,The Soup Nazi!
S09E23,CHILES,Soup Nazi? You people have a little pet name for everybody.
S09E23,HOYT,State your name.
S09E23,SOUP NAZI,Yev Kassem.
S09E23,HOYT,Could you spell that?
S09E23,SOUP NAZI,No! Next question.
S09E23,HOYT,How do you know the defendants?
S09E23,SOUP NAZI,They used to come to my restaurant.
S09E23,GEORGE,Medium turkey chili.
S09E23,JERRY,Medium crab bisque.
S09E23,GEORGE,I didn't get any bread.
S09E23,JERRY,Just forget it. Let it go.
S09E23,GEORGE,"Um, excuse me, I think you forgot my bread."
S09E23,SOUP NAZI,You want bread?
S09E23,GEORGE,"Yes, please."
S09E23,SOUP NAZI,Three dollars!
S09E23,GEORGE,What?
S09E23,SOUP NAZI,No soup for you!
S09E23,SOUP NAZI,"But the idiot clowns did not know how to order. I banned that one - the woman - for a year. Then one day, she came back."
S09E23,ELAINE,Five cups chopped porcini mushrooms. Half a cup of olive oil. Three pounds celery.
S09E23,SOUP NAZI,That's my recipe for wild mushroom.
S09E23,ELAINE,"You're through, Soup Nazi. Pack it up. No more soup for you. Next!"
S09E23,SOUP NAZI,"She published my recipes. I had to close the store, move to Argentina. She ruined my business!"
S09E23,ELAINE,Soup's not all that good anyway.
S09E23,SOUP NAZI,What did you say?!
S09E23,HOYT,The state calls Mr. Babu Bhatt to the stand.
S09E23,JERRY,How did they find Babu?
S09E23,ELAINE,I thought he was deported.
S09E23,HOYT,"You came a long way to be here today, haven't you?"
S09E23,HOYT,And what's your connection to the defendant?
S09E23,HOYT,And then what happened?
S09E23,RIVERA,"Hi everybody, I'm Geraldo Rivera and welcome to this special edition of Rivera Live. Well, arguments in the Good Samaritan trial ended today. The jury has been in deliberation for four and a half hours now. Let's go live to Jane Wells who is in Latham, Massachusetts, covering this trial for us. Jane -"
S09E23,WELLS,"Geraldo, just a few minutes ago, the jury asked to see the video tape."
S09E23,RIVERA,That's the one where they are overheard making sarcastic remarks during the robbery.
S09E23,WELLS,"Yes, it's a very incriminating piece of evidence. But I must tell you, Geraldo, this courtroom and everyone who has attended this trial is still reeling from the endless parade of witness who have come forth so enthusiastically to testify against these four seemingly ordinary people. One even had the feeling that if Judge Vandelay didn't finally put a stop to it, it could've gone on for months."
S09E23,RIVERA,"Jane, whose testimony do you think resonated most strongly with this jury?"
S09E23,WELLS,"That is so hard to say. Certainly there's the doctor with the poison invitations. The Bubble Boy was an extremely sympathetic and tragic figure. And that bizarre contest certainly didn't sit well with this small town jury.There's the woman they sold the defective wheelchair to, the deported Pakistani restaurateur. Geraldo, it just went on, and on, and on, into the night."
S09E23,RIVERA,And so we wait.
S09E23,JERRY,Do they make you wear uniforms in prison?
S09E23,ELAINE,I think so.
S09E23,JERRY,It's not that bright orange one is it?
S09E23,ELAINE,"I hope it's not that one, because I cannot wear orange."
S09E23,KRAMER,Will you stop worrying? Jackie's going to get us off. He never loses. How about when he asked that cop if a black man had ever been to his house. Did you see the look on his face?
S09E23,ESTELLE,"Sorry to bother you, Judge."
S09E23,VANDELAY,How did you get in here?
S09E23,ESTELLE,"Please, if he's found guilty, please be kind to him. He's a good boy."
S09E23,VANDELAY,This is highly irregular.
S09E23,ESTELLE,"Well, maybe there's something I can do for you."
S09E23,VANDELAY,What do you mean?
S09E23,ESTELLE,You know
S09E23,SIDRA,"Oh, Jackie, you're so articulate."
S09E23,CHILES,"We have plenty of time, too. This jury could be out for days."
S09E23,CHILES,Hello? Damn. They're ready.
S09E23,JERRY,"Hey Elaine, what was it you were about to say to me on the plane when it was going down?"
S09E23,ELAINE,I've always loved ... United Airlines.
S09E23,KRAMER,I think it's going to be okay - that girl just smiled at me.
S09E23,JERRY,Maybe because she knows you're going to jail.
S09E23,BAILIFF,All rise.
S09E23,VANDELAY,"Ladies and gentlemen of the jury, have you reached a verdict?"
S09E23,FOREMAN,"We have, Your Honor."
S09E23,VANDELAY,"Will the defendants please rise. And how do you find, with respect to the charge of criminal indifference?"
S09E23,FOREMAN,We find the defendants - guilty.
S09E23,VANDELAY,"Order! Order in this court, I will clear this room! I do not know how, or under what circumstances the four of you found each other, but your callous indifference and utter disregard for everything that is good and decent has rocked the very foundation upon which our society is built. I can think of nothing more fitting than for the four of youto spend a year removed from society so that you can contemplate the manner in which you have conducted yourselves. I know I will. This court is adjourned."
S09E23,GEORGE,You had to hop! You had to hop on the plane.
S09E23,ELAINE,"Puddy, don't wait for me."
S09E23,PUDDY,Alright.
S09E23,FRANK,We gotta get out of here. We want to beat the traffic.
S09E23,SIDRA,"Come on, Jackie. Let's go."
S09E23,JERRY,What?
S09E23,CHILES,"Oh, and by the way, they're real, and they're spectacular."
S09E23,JERRY,"Well, it's only a year. That's not so bad. We'll be out in a year, and then we'll be back"
S09E23,KRAMER,"Could be fun. Don't have to worry about your meals, or what you're going to do Saturday night. And they do shows. Yeah, we could put on a show - maybe ""Bye Bye Birdie"" or ""My Fair Lady"". Elaine, you could be Liza Doolittle."
S09E23,ELAINE,Why don't you just blow it out your a...
S09E23,ELAINE,"If I call Jill from prison, do you think that would make up for the other ones?"
S09E23,JERRY,Sure.
S09E23,ELAINE,Cause you only get one call. The prison call is like the king of calls.
S09E23,JERRY,I think that would be a very nice gesture.
S09E23,KRAMER,"I got it - it's out! How about that, huh? Oh, boy, what a relief."
S09E23,JERRY,"See now, to me, that button is in the worst possible spot."
S09E23,GEORGE,Really?
S09E23,JERRY,"Oh yeah. The second button is the key button. It literally makes or breaks the shirt. Look at it, it's too high, it's in no-man's land."
S09E23,GEORGE,Haven't we had this conversation before?
S09E23,JERRY,You think?
S09E23,GEORGE,I think we have.
S09E23,JERRY,"Yeah, maybe we have."
S09E23,JERRY,"So what is the deal with the yard? I mean when I was a kid my mother wanted me to play in the yard. But of course she didn't have to worry about my next door neighbor Tommy sticking a shiv in my thigh. And what's with the lockdown? Why do we have to be locked in our cells? Are we that bad that we have to be sent to prison, in prison? You would think the weightlifting and the sodomy is enough. So, anyone from Cellblock D?"
S09E23,PRISONER 1,I am.
S09E23,JERRY,"I'll talk slower. I'm kidding - I love Cellblock D. My friend George is in Cellblock D. What are you in for,sir?"
S09E23,PRISONER 2,Murder one.
S09E23,JERRY,"Murder one? Oooooo, watch out everybody. Better be nice to you. I'm only kidding sir - lighten up. How about you, what are you in for?"
S09E23,PRISONER 3,Grand theft auto.
S09E23,JERRY,Grand theft auto - don't steal any of my jokes.
S09E23,PRISONER 3,You suck - I'm gonna cut you.
S09E23,JERRY,"Hey, I don't come down to where you work, and knock the license plate out of your hand."
S09E23,GUARD,"Alright, Seinfeld, that's it. Let's go. Come on."
S09E23,JERRY,"Alright, hey, you've been great! See you in the cafeteria."
